    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some years ago a book was published under the title of &ldquo;The Pilgrim&rsquo;s
      Scrip.&rdquo; It consisted of a selection of original aphorisms by an anonymous
      gentleman, who in this bashful manner gave a bruised heart to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no pretension to novelty. &ldquo;Our new thoughts have thrilled dead
      bosoms,&rdquo; he wrote; by which avowal it may be seen that youth had
      manifestly gone from him, since he had ceased to be jealous of the
      ancients. There was a half-sigh floating through his pages for those days
      of intellectual coxcombry, when ideas come to us affecting the embraces of
      virgins, and swear to us they are ours alone, and no one else have they
      ever visited: and we believe them.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an example of his ideas of the sex he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect that Woman will be the last thing civilized by Man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some excitement was produced in the bosoms of ladies by so monstrous a
      scorn of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      One adventurous person betook herself to the Heralds&rsquo; College, and there
      ascertained that a Griffin between two Wheatsheaves, which stood on the
      title-page of the book, formed the crest of Sir Austin Absworthy Bearne
      Feverel, Baronet, of Raynham Abbey, in a certain Western county folding
      Thames: a man of wealth and honour, and a somewhat lamentable history.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outline of the baronet&rsquo;s story was by no means new. He had a wife, and
      he had a friend. His marriage was for love; his wife was a beauty; his
      friend was a sort of poet. His wife had his whole heart, and his friend
      all his confidence. When he selected Denzil Somers from among his college
      chums, it was not on account of any similarity of disposition between
      them, but from his intense worship of genius, which made him overlook the
      absence of principle in his associate for the sake of such brilliant
      promise. Denzil had a small patrimony to lead off with, and that he
      dissipated before he left college; thenceforth he was dependent upon his
      admirer, with whom he lived, filling a nominal post of bailiff to the
      estates, and launching forth verse of some satiric and sentimental
      quality; for being inclined to vice, and occasionally, and in a quiet way,
      practising it, he was of course a sentimentalist and a satirist, entitled
      to lash the Age and complain of human nature. His earlier poems, published
      under the pseudonym of Diaper Sandoe, were so pure and bloodless in their
      love passages, and at the same time so biting in their moral tone, that
      his reputation was great among the virtuous, who form the larger portion
      of the English book-buying public. Election-seasons called him to
      ballad-poetry on behalf of the Tory party. Dialer possessed undoubted
      fluency, but did tittle, though Sir Austin was ever expecting much of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A languishing, inexperienced woman, whose husband in mental and in moral
      stature is more than the ordinary height above her, and who, now that her
      first romantic admiration of his lofty bearing has worn off, and her
      fretful little refinements of taste and sentiment are not instinctively
      responded to, is thrown into no wholesome household collision with a
      fluent man, fluent in prose and rhyme. Lady Feverel, when she first
      entered on her duties at Raynham, was jealous of her husband&rsquo;s friend. By
      degrees she tolerated him. In time he touched his guitar in her chamber,
      and they played Rizzio and Mary together.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;For I am not the first who found
        The name of Mary fatal!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      says a subsequent sentimental alliterative love-poem of Diaper&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the outline of the story. But the baronet could fill it up. He
      had opened his soul to these two. He had been noble Love to the one, and
      to the other perfect Friendship. He had bid them be brother and sister
      whom he loved, and live a Golden Age with him at Raynham. In fact, he had
      been prodigal of the excellences of his nature, which it is not good to
      be, and, like Timon, he became bankrupt, and fell upon bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faithless lady was of no particular family; an orphan daughter of an
      admiral who educated her on his half-pay, and her conduct struck but at
      the man whose name she bore.
    </p>
    <p>
      After five years of marriage, and twelve of friendship, Sir Austin was
      left to his loneliness with nothing to ease his heart of love upon save a
      little baby boy in a cradle. He forgave the man: he put him aside as poor
      for his wrath. The woman he could not forgive; she had sinned every way.
      Simple ingratitude to a benefactor was a pardonable transgression, for he
      was not one to recount and crush the culprit under the heap of his good
      deeds. But her he had raised to be his equal, and he judged her as his
      equal. She had blackened the world&rsquo;s fair aspect for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the presence of that world, so different to him now, he preserved his
      wonted demeanor, and made his features a flexible mask. Mrs. Doria Forey,
      his widowed sister, said that Austin might have retired from his
      Parliamentary career for a time, and given up gaieties and that kind of
      thing; her opinion, founded on observation of him in public and private,
      was, that the light thing who had taken flight was but a feather on her
      brother&rsquo;s Feverel-heart, and his ordinary course of life would be resumed.
      There are times when common men cannot bear the weight of just so much.
      Hippias Feverel, one of his brothers, thought him immensely improved by
      his misfortune, if the loss of such a person could be so designated; and
      seeing that Hippias received in consequence free quarters at Raynham, and
      possession of the wing of the Abbey she had inhabited, it is profitable to
      know his thoughts. If the baronet had given two or three blazing dinners
      in the great hall he would have deceived people generally, as he did his
      relatives and intimates. He was too sick for that: fit only for passive
      acting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nursemaid waking in the night beheld a solitary figure darkening a
      lamp above her little sleeping charge, and became so used to the sight as
      never to wake with a start. One night she was strangely aroused by a sound
      of sobbing. The baronet stood beside the cot in his long black cloak and
      travelling cap. His fingers shaded a lamp, and reddened against the fitful
      darkness that ever and anon went leaping up the wall. She could hardly
      believe her senses to see the austere gentleman, dead silent, dropping
      tear upon tear before her eyes. She lay stone-still in a trance of terror
      and mournfulness, mechanically counting the tears as they fell, one by
      one. The hidden face, the fall and flash of those heavy drops in the light
      of the lamp he held, the upright, awful figure, agitated at regular
      intervals like a piece of clockwork by the low murderous catch of his
      breath: it was so piteous to her poor human nature that her heart began
      wildly palpitating. Involuntarily the poor girl cried out to him, &ldquo;Oh,
      sir!&rdquo; and fell a-weeping. Sir Austin turned the lamp on her pillow, and
      harshly bade her go to sleep, striding from the room forthwith. He
      dismissed her with a purse the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, when he was seven years old, the little fellow woke up at night to
      see a lady bending over him. He talked of this the neat day, but it was
      treated as a dream; until in the course of the day his uncle Algernon was
      driven home from Lobourne cricket-ground with a broken leg. Then it was
      recollected that there was a family ghost; and, though no member of the
      family believed in the ghost, none would have given up a circumstance that
      testified to its existence; for to possess a ghost is a distinction above
      titles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Algernon Feverel lost his leg, and ceased to be a gentleman in the Guards.
      Of the other uncles of young Richard, Cuthbert, the sailor, perished in a
      spirited boat expedition against a slaving negro chief up the Niger. Some
      of the gallant lieutenant&rsquo;s trophies of war decorated the little boy&rsquo;s
      play-shed at Raynham, and he bequeathed his sword to Richard, whose hero
      he was. The diplomatist and beau, Vivian, ended his flutterings from
      flower to flower by making an improper marriage, as is the fate of many a
      beau, and was struck out of the list of visitors. Algernon generally
      occupied the baronet&rsquo;s disused town-house, a wretched being, dividing his
      time between horse and card exercise: possessed, it was said, of the
      absurd notion that a man who has lost his balance by losing his leg may
      regain it by sticking to the bottle. At least, whenever he and his brother
      Hippias got together, they never failed to try whether one leg, or two,
      stood the bottle best. Much of a puritan as Sir Austin was in his habits,
      he was too good a host, and too thorough a gentleman, to impose them upon
      his guests. The brothers, and other relatives, might do as they would
      while they did not disgrace the name, and then it was final: they must
      depart to behold his countenance no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Algernon Feverel was a simple man, who felt, subsequent to his misfortune,
      as he had perhaps dimly fancied it before, that his career lay in his
      legs, and was now irrevocably cut short. He taught the boy boxing, and
      shooting, and the arts of fence, and superintended the direction of his
      animal vigour with a melancholy vivacity. The remaining energies of
      Algernon&rsquo;s mind were devoted to animadversions on swift bowling. He
      preached it over the county, struggling through laborious literary
      compositions, addressed to sporting newspapers, on the Decline of Cricket.
      It was Algernon who witnessed and chronicled young Richard&rsquo;s first fight,
      which was with young Tom Blaize of Belthorpe Farm, three years the boy&rsquo;s
      senior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippias Feverel was once thought to be the genius of the family. It was
      his ill luck to have strong appetites and a weak stomach; and, as one is
      not altogether fit for the battle of life who is engaged in a perpetual
      contention with his dinner, Hippias forsook his prospects at the Bar, and,
      in the embraces of dyspepsia, compiled his ponderous work on the Fairy
      Mythology of Europe. He had little to do with the Hope of Raynham beyond
      what he endured from his juvenile tricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      A venerable lady, known as Great-Aunt Grantley, who had money to bequeath
      to the heir, occupied with Hippias the background of the house and shared
      her candles with him. These two were seldom seen till the dinner hour, for
      which they were all day preparing, and probably all night remembering, for
      the Eighteenth Century was an admirable trencherman, and cast age aside
      while there was a dish on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doris Foray was the eldest of the three sisters of the baronet, a
      florid affable woman, with fine teeth, exceedingly fine light wavy hair, a
      Norman nose, and a reputation for understanding men; and that, with these
      practical creatures, always means the art of managing them. She had
      married an expectant younger son of a good family, who deceased before the
      fulfilment of his prospects; and, casting about in her mind the future
      chances of her little daughter and sole child, Clare, she marked down a
      probability. The far sight, the deep determination, the resolute
      perseverance of her sex, where a daughter is to be provided for and a man
      to be overthrown, instigated her to invite herself to Raynham, where, with
      that daughter, she fixed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other two Feverel ladies were the wife of Colonel Wentworth and the
      widow of Mr. Justice Harley: and the only thing remarkable about them was
      that they were mothers of sons of some distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Austin Wentworth&rsquo;s story was of that wretched character which to be
      comprehended, that justice should be dealt him, must be told out and
      openly; which no one dares now do.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a fault in early youth, redeemed by him nobly, according to his light,
      he was condemned to undergo the world&rsquo;s harsh judgment: not for the fault&mdash;for
      its atonement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;Married his mother&rsquo;s housemaid,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Doria, with a
      ghastly look, and a shudder at young men of republican sentiments, which
      he was reputed to entertain. &ldquo;&lsquo;The compensation for Injustice,&rsquo; says the
      &lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip,&rsquo; is, that in that dark Ordeal we gather the worthiest
      around us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the baronet&rsquo;s fair friend, Lady Blandish, and some few true men and
      women, held Austin Wentworth high.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not live with his wife; and Sir Austin, whose mind was bent on the
      future of our species, reproached him with being barren to posterity,
      while knaves were propagating.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal characteristic of the second nephew, Adrian Harley, was his
      sagacity. He was essentially the wise youth, both in counsel and in
      action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In action,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip&rdquo; observes, &ldquo;Wisdom goes by majorities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian had an instinct for the majority, and, as the world invariably
      found him enlisted in its ranks, his appellation of wise youth was
      acquiesced in without irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wise youth, then, had the world with him, but no friends. Nor did he
      wish for those troublesome appendages of success. He caused himself to be
      required by people who could serve him; feared by such as could injure.
      Not that he went out of the way to secure his end, or risked the expense
      of a plot. He did the work as easily as he ate his daily bread. Adrian was
      an epicurean; one whom Epicurus would have scourged out of his garden,
      certainly: an epicurean of our modern notions. To satisfy his appetites
      without rashly staking his character, was the wise youth&rsquo;s problem for
      life. He had no intimates except Gibbon and Horace, and the society of
      these fine aristocrats of literature helped him to accept humanity as it
      had been, and was; a supreme ironic procession, with laughter of Gods in
      the background. Why not laughter of mortals also? Adrian had his laugh in
      his comfortable corner. He possessed peculiar attributes of a heathen God.
      He was a disposer of men: he was polished, luxurious, and happy&mdash;at
      their cost. He lived in eminent self-content, as one lying on soft cloud,
      lapt in sunshine. Nor Jove, nor Apollo, cast eye upon the maids of earth
      with cooler fire of selection, or pursued them in the covert with more
      sacred impunity. And he enjoyed his reputation for virtue as something
      additional. Stolen fruits are said to be sweet; undeserved rewards are
      exquisite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best of it was, that Adrian made no pretences. He did not solicit the
      favourable judgment of the world. Nature and he attempted no other
      concealment than the ordinary mask men wear. And yet the world would
      proclaim him moral, as well as wise, and the pleasing converse every way
      of his disgraced cousin Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a word, Adrian Harley had mastered his philosophy at the early age of
      one-and-twenty. Many would be glad to say the same at that age twice-told:
      they carry in their breasts a burden with which Adrian&rsquo;s was not loaded.
      Mrs. Doria was nearly right about his heart. A singular mishap (at his
      birth, possibly, or before it) had unseated that organ, and shaken it down
      to his stomach, where it was a much lighter, nay, an inspiring weight, and
      encouraged him merrily onward. Throned there it looked on little that did
      not arrive to gratify it. Already that region was a trifle prominent in
      the person of the wise youth, and carried, as it were, the flag of his
      philosophical tenets in front of him. He was charming after dinner, with
      men or with women: delightfully sarcastic: perhaps a little too
      unscrupulous in his moral tone, but that his moral reputation belied him,
      and it must be set down to generosity of disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was Adrian Harley, another of Sir Austin&rsquo;s intellectual favourites,
      chosen from mankind to superintend the education of his son at Raynham.
      Adrian had been destined for the Church. He did not enter into Orders. He
      and the baronet had a conference together one day, and from that time
      Adrian became a fixture in the Abbey. His father died in his promising
      son&rsquo;s college term, bequeathing him nothing but his legal complexion, and
      Adrian became stipendiary officer in his uncle&rsquo;s household.
    </p>
    <p>
      A playfellow of Richard&rsquo;s occasionally, and the only comrade of his age
      that he ever saw, was Master Ripton Thompson, the son of Sir Austin&rsquo;s
      solicitor, a boy without a character.
    </p>
    <p>
      A comrade of some description was necessary, for Richard was neither to go
      to school nor to college. Sir Austin considered that the schools were
      corrupt, and maintained that young lads might by parental vigilance be
      kept pretty secure from the Serpent until Eve sided with him: a period
      that might be deferred, he said. He had a system of education for his son.
      How it worked we shall see.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      October, shone royally on Richard&rsquo;s fourteenth birthday. The brown
      beechwoods and golden birches glowed to a brilliant sun. Banks of moveless
      cloud hung about the horizon, mounded to the west, where slept the wind.
      Promise of a great day for Raynham, as it proved to be, though not in the
      manner marked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already archery-booths and cricketing-tents were rising on the lower
      grounds towards the river, whither the lads of Bursley and Lobourne, in
      boats and in carts, shouting for a day of ale and honour, jogged merrily
      to match themselves anew, and pluck at the lining laurel from each other&rsquo;s
      brows, line manly Britons. The whole park was beginning to be astir and
      resound with holiday cries. Sir Austin Feverel, a thorough good Tory, was
      no game-preserver, and could be popular whenever he chose, which Sir Males
      Papworth, on the other side of the river, a fast-handed Whig and terror to
      poachers, never could be. Half the village of Lobourne was seen trooping
      through the avenues of the park. Fiddlers and gipsies clamoured at the
      gates for admission: white smocks, and slate, surmounted by hats of
      serious brim, and now and then a scarlet cloak, smacking of the old
      country, dotted the grassy sweeps to the levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the time the star of these festivities was receding further and
      further, and eclipsing himself with his reluctant serf Ripton, who kept
      asking what they were to do and where they were going, and how late it was
      in the day, and suggesting that the lads of Lobourne would be calling out
      for them, and Sir Austin requiring their presence, without getting any
      attention paid to his misery or remonstrances. For Richard had been
      requested by his father to submit to medical examination like a boor
      enlisting for a soldier, and he was in great wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was flying as though he would have flown from the shameful thought of
      what had been asked of him. By-and-by he communicated his sentiments to
      Ripton, who said they were those of a girl: an offensive remark,
      remembering which, Richard, after they had borrowed a couple of guns at
      the bailiff&rsquo;s farm, and Ripton had fired badly, called his friend a fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling that circumstances were making him look wonderfully like one,
      Ripton lifted his head and retorted defiantly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This angry contradiction, so very uncalled for, annoyed Richard, who was
      still smarting at the loss of the birds, owing to Ripton&rsquo;s bad shot, and
      was really the injured party. He, therefore bestowed the abusive epithet
      on Ripton anew, and with increase of emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t call me so, then, whether I am or not,&rdquo; says Ripton, and sucks
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was becoming personal. Richard sent up his brows, and stared at his
      defier an instant. He then informed him that he certainly should call him
      so, and would not object to call him so twenty times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it, and see!&rdquo; returns Ripton, rocking on his feet, and breathing
      quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a gravity of which only boys and other barbarians are capable,
      Richard went through the entire number, stressing the epithet to increase
      the defiance and avoid monotony, as he progressed, while Ripton bobbed his
      head every time in assent, as it were, to his comrade&rsquo;s accuracy, and as a
      record for his profound humiliation. The dog they had with them gazed at
      the extraordinary performance with interrogating wags of the tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty times, duly and deliberately, Richard repeated the obnoxious word.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the twentieth solemn iteration of Ripton&rsquo;s capital shortcoming, Ripton
      delivered a smart back-hander on Richard&rsquo;s mouth, and squared
      precipitately; perhaps sorry when the deed was done, for he was a
      kind-hearted lad, and as Richard simply bowed in acknowledgment of the
      blow he thought he had gone too far. He did not know the young gentleman
      he was dealing with. Richard was extremely cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we fight here?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anywhere you like,&rdquo; replied Ripton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little more into the wood, I think. We may be interrupted.&rdquo; And Richard
      led the way with a courteous reserve that somewhat chilled Ripton&rsquo;s ardour
      for the contest. On the skirts of the wood, Richard threw off his jacket
      and waistcoat, and, quite collected, waited for Ripton to do the same. The
      latter boy was flushed and restless; older and broader, but not so
      tight-limbed and well-set. The Gods, sole witnesses of their battle,
      betted dead against him. Richard had mounted the white cockade of the
      Feverels, and there was a look in him that asked for tough work to
      extinguish. His brows, slightly lined upward at the temples, converging to
      a knot about the well-set straight nose; his full grey eyes, open
      nostrils, and planted feet, and a gentlemanly air of calm and alertness,
      formed a spirited picture of a young combatant. As for Ripton, he was all
      abroad, and fought in school-boy style&mdash;that is, he rushed at the foe
      head foremost, and struck like a windmill. He was a lumpy boy. When he did
      hit, he made himself felt; but he was at the mercy of science. To see him
      come dashing in, blinking and puffing and whirling his arms abroad while
      the felling blow went straight between them, you perceived that he was
      fighting a fight of desperation, and knew it. For the dreaded alternative
      glared him in the face that, if he yielded, he must look like what he had
      been twenty times calumniously called; and he would die rather than yield,
      and swing his windmill till he dropped. Poor boy! he dropped frequently.
      The gallant fellow fought for appearances, and down he went. The Gods
      favour one of two parties. Prince Turnus was a noble youth; but he had not
      Pallas at his elbow. Ripton was a capital boy; he had no science. He could
      not prove he was not a fool! When one comes to think of it, Ripton did
      choose the only possible way, and we should all of us have considerable
      difficulty in proving the negative by any other. Ripton came on the
      unerring fist again and again; and if it was true, as he said in short
      colloquial gasps, that he required as much beating as an egg to be beaten
      thoroughly, a fortunate interruption alone saved our friend from
      resembling that substance. The boys heard summoning voices, and beheld Mr.
      Morton of Poer Hall and Austin Wentworth stepping towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A truce was sounded, jackets were caught up, guns shouldered, and off they
      trotted in concert through the depths of the wood, not stopping till that
      and half-a-dozen fields and a larch plantation were well behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they halted to take breath, there was a mutual study of faces.
      Ripton&rsquo;s was much discoloured, and looked fiercer with its natural
      war-paint than the boy felt. Nevertheless, he squared up dauntlessly on
      the new ground, and Richard, whose wrath was appeased, could not refrain
      from asking him whether he had not really had enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; shouts the noble enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, look here,&rdquo; said Richard, appealing to common sense, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of
      knocking you down. I&rsquo;ll say you&rsquo;re not a fool, if you&rsquo;ll give me your
      hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton demurred an instant to consult with honour, who bade him catch at
      his chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand. &ldquo;There!&rdquo; and the boys grasped hands and were fast
      friends. Ripton had gained his point, and Richard decidedly had the best
      of it. So, they were on equal ground. Both, could claim a victory, which
      was all the better for their friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton washed his face and comforted his nose at a brook, and was now
      ready to follow his friend wherever he chose to lead. They continued to
      beat about for birds. The birds on the Raynham estates were found
      singularly cunning, and repeatedly eluded the aim of these prime shots, so
      they pushed their expedition into the lands of their neighbors, in search
      of a stupider race, happily oblivious of the laws and conditions of
      trespass; unconscious, too, that they were poaching on the demesne of the
      notorious Farmer Blaize, the free-trade farmer under the shield of the
      Papworths, no worshipper of the Griffin between two Wheatsheaves; destined
      to be much allied with Richard&rsquo;s fortunes from beginning to end. Farmer
      Blaize hated poachers, and, especially young chaps poaching, who did it
      mostly from impudence. He heard the audacious shots popping right and
      left, and going forth to have a glimpse at the intruders, and observing
      their size, swore he would teach my gentlemen a thing, lords or no lords.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard had brought down a beautiful cock-pheasant, and was exulting over
      it, when the farmer&rsquo;s portentous figure burst upon them, cracking an
      avenging horsewhip. His salute was ironical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Havin&rsquo; good sport, gentlemen, are ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just bagged a splendid bird!&rdquo; radiant Richard informed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Farmer Blaize gave an admonitory flick of the whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just let me clap eye on&rsquo;t, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, please,&rdquo; interposed Ripton, who was not blind to doubtful aspects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Blaize threw up his chin, and grinned grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please to you, sir? Why, my chap, you looks as if ye didn&rsquo;t much mind
      what come t&rsquo;yer nose, I reckon. You looks an old poacher, you do. Tall ye
      what &lsquo;tis&rsquo;!&rdquo; He changed his banter to business, &ldquo;That bird&rsquo;s mine! Now you
      jest hand him over, and sheer off, you dam young scoundrels! I know ye!&rdquo;
       And he became exceedingly opprobrious, and uttered contempt of the name of
      Feverel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wants to be horsewhipped, you&rsquo;ll stay where y&rsquo;are!&rdquo; continued the
      farmer. &ldquo;Giles Blaize never stands nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll stay,&rdquo; quoth Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! so be&rsquo;t! If you will have&rsquo;t, have&rsquo;t, my men!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a preparatory measure, Farmer Blaize seized a wing of the bird, on
      which both boys flung themselves desperately, and secured it minus the
      pinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your game,&rdquo; cried the farmer. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a taste of horsewhip for ye.
      I never stands nonsense!&rdquo; and sweetch went the mighty whip, well swayed.
      The boys tried to close with him. He kept his distance and lashed without
      mercy. Black blood was made by Farmer Blaize that day! The boys wriggled,
      in spite of themselves. It was like a relentless serpent coiling, and
      biting, and stinging their young veins to madness. Probably they felt the
      disgrace of the contortions they were made to go through more than the
      pain, but the pain was fierce, for the farmer laid about from a practised
      arm, and did not consider that he had done enough till he was well
      breathed and his ruddy jowl inflamed. He paused, to receive the remainder
      of the cock-pheasant in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your beastly bird,&rdquo; cried Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money, my lads, and interest,&rdquo; roared the farmer, lashing out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shameful as it was to retreat, there was but that course open to them.
      They decided to surrender the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look! you big brute,&rdquo; Richard shook his gun, hoarse with passion, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
      have shot you, if I&rsquo;d been loaded. Mind if I come across you when I&rsquo;m
      loaded, you coward, I&rsquo;ll fire!&rdquo; The un-English nature of this threat
      exasperated Farmer Blaize, and he pressed the pursuit in time to bestow a
      few farewell stripes as they were escaping tight-breeched into neutral
      territory. At the hedge they parleyed a minute, the farmer to inquire if
      they had had a mortal good tanning and were satisfied, for when they
      wanted a further instalment of the same they were to come for it to
      Belthorpe Farm, and there it was in pickle: the boys meantime exploding in
      menaces and threats of vengeance, on which the farmer contemptuously
      turned his back. Ripton had already stocked an armful of flints for the
      enjoyment of a little skirmishing. Richard, however, knocked them all out,
      saying, &ldquo;No! Gentlemen don&rsquo;t fling stones; leave that to the blackguards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just one shy at him!&rdquo; pleaded Ripton, with his eye on Farmer Blaize&rsquo;s
      broad mark, and his whole mind drunken with a sudden revelation of the
      advantages of light troops in opposition to heavies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Richard, imperatively, &ldquo;no stones,&rdquo; and marched briskly away.
      Ripton followed with a sigh. His leader&rsquo;s magnanimity was wholly beyond
      him. A good spanking mark at the farmer would have relieved Master Ripton;
      it would have done nothing to console Richard Feverel for the ignominy he
      had been compelled to submit to. Ripton was familiar with the rod, a
      monster much despoiled of his terrors by intimacy. Birch-fever was past
      with this boy. The horrible sense of shame, self-loathing, universal
      hatred, impotent vengeance, as if the spirit were steeped in abysmal
      blackness, which comes upon a courageous and sensitive youth condemned for
      the first time to taste this piece of fleshly bitterness, and suffer what
      he feels is a defilement, Ripton had weathered and forgotten. He was
      seasoned wood, and took the world pretty wisely; not reckless of
      castigation, as some boys become, nor oversensitive as to dishonour, as
      his friend and comrade beside him was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard&rsquo;s blood was poisoned. He had the fever on him severely. He would
      not allow stone-flinging, because it was a habit of his to discountenance
      it. Mere gentlemanly considerations has scarce shielded Farmer Blaize, and
      certain very ungentlemanly schemes were coming to ghastly heads in the
      tumult of his brain; rejected solely from their glaring impracticability
      even to his young intelligence. A sweeping and consummate vengeance for
      the indignity alone should satisfy him. Something tremendous must be done;
      and done without delay. At one moment he thought of killing all the
      farmer&rsquo;s cattle; next of killing him; challenging him to single combat
      with the arms, and according to the fashion of gentlemen. But the farmer
      was a coward; he would refuse. Then he, Richard Feverel, would stand by
      the farmer&rsquo;s bedside, and rouse him; rouse him to fight with powder and
      ball in his own chamber, in the cowardly midnight, where he might tremble,
      but dare not refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; cried simple Ripton, while these hopeful plots were raging in his
      comrade&rsquo;s brain, now sparkling for immediate execution, and anon lapsing
      disdainfully dark in their chances of fulfilment, &ldquo;how I wish you&rsquo;d have
      let me notch him, Ricky! I&rsquo;m a safe shot. I never miss. I should feel
      quite jolly if I&rsquo;d spanked him once. We should have had the beat of him at
      that game. I say!&rdquo; and a sharp thought drew Ripton&rsquo;s ideas nearer home, &ldquo;I
      wonder whether my nose is as bad as he says! Where can I see myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To these exclamations Richard was deaf, and he trudged steadily forward,
      facing but one object.
    </p>
    <p>
      After tearing through innumerable hedges, leaping fences, jumping dykes,
      penetrating brambly copses, and getting dirty, ragged, and tired, Ripton
      awoke from his dream of Farmer Blaize and a blue nose to the vivid
      consciousness of hunger; and this grew with the rapidity of light upon
      him, till in the course of another minute he was enduring the extremes of
      famine, and ventured to question his leader whither he was being
      conducted. Raynham was out of sight. They were a long way down the valley,
      miles from Lobourne, in a country of sour pools, yellow brooks, rank
      pasturage, desolate heath. Solitary cows were seen; the smoke of a mud
      cottage; a cart piled with peat; a donkey grazing at leisure, oblivious of
      an unkind world; geese by a horse-pond, gabbling as in the first
      loneliness of creation; uncooked things that a famishing boy cannot
      possibly care for, and must despise. Ripton was in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going to?&rdquo; he inquired with a voice of the last time of
      asking, and halted resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard now broke his silence to reply, &ldquo;Anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anywhere!&rdquo; Ripton took up the moody word. &ldquo;But ain&rsquo;t you awfully hungry?&rdquo;
       he gasped vehemently, in a way that showed the total emptiness of his
      stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was Richard&rsquo;s brief response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not hungry!&rdquo; Ripton&rsquo;s amazement lent him increased vehemence. &ldquo;Why, you
      haven&rsquo;t had anything to eat since breakfast! Not hungry? I declare I&rsquo;m
      starving. I feel such a gnawing I could eat dry bread and cheese!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard sneered: not for reasons that would have actuated a similar
      demonstration of the philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; cried Ripton, &ldquo;at all events, tell us where you&rsquo;re going to stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard faced about to make a querulous retort. The injured and hapless
      visage that met his eye disarmed him. The lad&rsquo;s nose, though not exactly
      of the dreaded hue, was really becoming discoloured. To upbraid him would
      be cruel. Richard lifted his head, surveyed the position, and exclaiming
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; dropped down on a withered bank, leaving Ripton to contemplate him
      as a puzzle whose every new move was a worse perplexity.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Among boys there are laws of honour and chivalrous codes, not written or
      formally taught, but intuitively understood by all, and invariably acted
      upon by the loyal and the true. The race is not nearly civilized, we must
      remember. Thus, not to follow your leader whithersoever he may think
      proper to lead; to back out of an expedition because the end of it frowns
      dubious, and the present fruit of it is discomfort; to quit a comrade on
      the road, and return home without him: these are tricks which no boy of
      spirit would be guilty of, let him come to any description of mortal grief
      in consequence. Better so than have his own conscience denouncing him
      sneak. Some boys who behave boldly enough are not troubled by this
      conscience, and the eyes and the lips of their fellows have to supply the
      deficiency. They do it with just as haunting, and even more horrible
      pertinacity, than the inner voice, and the result, if the probation be not
      very severe and searching, is the same. The leader can rely on the
      faithfulness of his host: the comrade is sworn to serve. Master Ripton
      Thompson was naturally loyal. The idea of turning off and forsaking his
      friend never once crossed his mind, though his condition was desperate,
      and his friend&rsquo;s behaviour that of a Bedlamite. He announced several times
      impatiently that they would be too late for dinner. His friend did not
      budge. Dinner seemed nothing to him. There he lay plucking grass, and
      patting the old dog&rsquo;s nose, as if incapable of conceiving what a thing
      hunger was. Ripton took half-a-dozen turns up and down, and at last flung
      himself down beside the taciturn boy, accepting his fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the chance that works for certain purposes sent a smart shower from
      the sinking sun, and the wet sent two strangers for shelter in the lane
      behind the hedge where the boys reclined. One was a travelling tinker, who
      lit a pipe and spread a tawny umbrella. The other was a burly young
      countryman, pipeless and tentless. They saluted with a nod, and began
      recounting for each other&rsquo;s benefit the daylong-doings of the weather, as
      it had affected their individual experience and followed their prophecies.
      Both had anticipated and foretold a bit of rain before night, and
      therefore both welcomed the wet with satisfaction. A monotonous
      betweenwhiles kind of talk they kept droning, in harmony with the still
      hum of the air. From the weather theme they fell upon the blessings of
      tobacco; how it was the poor man&rsquo;s friend, his company, his consolation,
      his comfort, his refuge at night, his first thought in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than a wife!&rdquo; chuckled the tinker. &ldquo;No curtain-lecturin&rsquo; with a
      pipe. Your pipe an&rsquo;t a shrew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That be it!&rdquo; the other chimed in. &ldquo;Your pipe doan&rsquo;t mak&rsquo; ye out wi&rsquo; all
      the cash Saturday evenin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take one,&rdquo; said the tinker, in the enthusiasm of the moment, handing a
      grimy short clay. Speed-the-Plough filled from the tinker&rsquo;s pouch, and
      continued his praises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penny a day, and there y&rsquo;are, primed! Better than a wife? Ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you can get rid of it, if ye wants for to, and when ye wants,&rdquo; added
      tinker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So ye can!&rdquo; Speed-the-Plough took him up. &ldquo;And ye doan&rsquo;t want for to.
      Leastways, t&rsquo;other case. I means pipe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued tinker, comprehending him perfectly, &ldquo;it don&rsquo;t bring
      repentance after it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not nohow, master, it doan&rsquo;t! And&rdquo;&mdash;Speed-the-Plough cocked his eye&mdash;&ldquo;it
      doan&rsquo;t eat up half the victuals, your pipe doan&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the honest yeoman gesticulated his keen sense of a clincher, which
      the tinker acknowledged; and having, so to speak, sealed up the subject by
      saying the best thing that could be said, the two smoked for some time in
      silence to the drip and patter of the shower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton solaced his wretchedness by watching them through the briar hedge.
      He saw the tinker stroking a white cat, and appealing to her, every now
      and then, as his missus, for an opinion or a confirmation; and he thought
      that a curious sight. Speed-the-Plough was stretched at full length, with
      his boots in the rain, and his head amidst the tinker&rsquo;s pots, smoking,
      profoundly contemplative. The minutes seemed to be taken up alternately by
      the grey puffs from their mouths.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the tinker who renewed the colloquy. Said he, &ldquo;Times is bad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His companion assented, &ldquo;Sure-ly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it somehow comes round right,&rdquo; resumed the tinker. &ldquo;Why, look here.
      Where&rsquo;s the good o&rsquo; moping? I sees it all come round right and tight. Now
      I travels about. I&rsquo;ve got my beat. &lsquo;Casion calls me t&rsquo;other day to
      Newcastle!&mdash;Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coals!&rdquo; ejaculated Speed-the-Plough sonorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coals!&rdquo; echoed the tinker. &ldquo;You ask what I goes there for, mayhap? Never
      you mind. One sees a mort o&rsquo; life in my trade. Not for coals it isn&rsquo;t. And
      I don&rsquo;t carry &lsquo;em there, neither. Anyhow, I comes back. London&rsquo;s my mark.
      Says I, I&rsquo;ll see a bit o&rsquo; the sea, and steps aboard a collier. We were as
      nigh wrecked as the prophet Paul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;A&mdash;who&rsquo;s him?&rdquo; the other wished to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read your Bible,&rdquo; said the tinker. &ldquo;We pitched and tossed&mdash;&lsquo;tain&rsquo;t
      that game at sea &lsquo;tis on land, I can tell ye! I thinks, down we&rsquo;re a-going&mdash;say
      your prayers, Bob Tiles! That was a night, to be sure! But God&rsquo;s above the
      devil, and here I am, ye see.&rdquo; Speed-the-Plough lurched round on his elbow
      and regarded him indifferently. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye call that doctrin&rsquo;? He bean&rsquo;t
      al&rsquo;ays, or I shoo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be scrapin&rsquo; my heels wi&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; to do, and, what&rsquo;s
      warse, nothin&rsquo; to eat. Why, look heer. Luck&rsquo;s luck, and bad luck&rsquo;s the
      con-trary. Varmer Bollop, t&rsquo;other day, has&rsquo;s rick burnt down. Next night
      his gran&rsquo;ry&rsquo;s burnt. What do he tak&rsquo; and go and do? He takes and goes and
      hangs unsel&rsquo;, and turns us out of his employ. God warn&rsquo;t above the devil
      then, I thinks, or I can&rsquo;t make out the reckonin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tinker cleared his throat, and said it was a bad case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a darn&rsquo;d bad case. I&rsquo;ll tak&rsquo; my oath on&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Speed-the-Plough.
      &ldquo;Well, look heer! Heer&rsquo;s another darn&rsquo;d bad case. I threshed for Varmer
      Blaize Blaize o&rsquo; Beltharpe afore I goes to Varmer Bollop. Varmer Blaize
      misses pilkins. He swears our chaps steals pilkins. &lsquo;Twarn&rsquo;t me steals
      &lsquo;em. What do he tak&rsquo; and go and do? He takes and tarns us off, me and
      another, neck and crop, to scuffle about and starve, for all he keers. God
      warn&rsquo;t above the devil then, I thinks. Not nohow, as I can see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tinker shook his head, and said that was a bad case also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you can&rsquo;t mend it,&rdquo; added Speed-the-Plough. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad, and there it
      be. But I&rsquo;ll tell ye what, master. Bad wants payin&rsquo; for.&rdquo; He nodded and
      winked mysteriously. &ldquo;Bad has its wages as well&rsquo;s honest work, I&rsquo;m
      thinkin&rsquo;. Varmer Bollop I don&rsquo;t owe no grudge to: Varmer Blaize I do. And
      I shud like to stick a Lucifer in his rick some dry windy night.&rdquo;
       Speed-the-Plough screwed up an eye villainously. &ldquo;He wants hittin&rsquo; in the
      wind,&mdash;jest where the pocket is, master, do Varmer Blaize, and he&rsquo;ll
      cry out &lsquo;O Lor&rsquo;!&rsquo; Varmer Blaize will. You won&rsquo;t get the better o&rsquo; Varmer
      Blaize by no means, as I makes out, if ye doan&rsquo;t hit into him jest there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tinker sent a rapid succession of white clouds from his mouth, and
      said that would be taking the devil&rsquo;s side of a bad case. Speed-the-Plough
      observed energetically that, if Farmer Blaize was on the other, he should
      be on that side.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a young gentleman close by, who thought with him. The hope of
      Raynham had lent a careless half-compelled attention to the foregoing
      dialogue, wherein a common labourer and a travelling tinker had propounded
      and discussed one of the most ancient theories of transmundane dominion
      and influence on mundane affairs. He now started to his feet, and came
      tearing through the briar hedge, calling out for one of them to direct
      them the nearest road to Bursley. The tinker was kindling preparations for
      his tea, under the tawny umbrella. A loaf was set forth, oh which Ripton&rsquo;s
      eyes, stuck in the edge, fastened ravenously. Speed-the-Plough volunteered
      information that Bursley was a good three mile from where they stood, and
      a good eight mile from Lobourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you half-a-crown for that loaf, my good fellow,&rdquo; said Richard
      to the tinker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bargain;&rdquo; quoth the tinker, &ldquo;eh, missus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His cat replied by humping her back at the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      The half-crown was tossed down, and Ripton, who had just succeeded in
      freeing his limbs from the briar, prickly as a hedgehog, collared the
      loaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those young squires be sharp-set, and no mistake,&rdquo; said the tinker to his
      companion. &ldquo;Come! we&rsquo;ll to Bursley after &lsquo;em, and talk it out over a pot
      o&rsquo; beer.&rdquo; Speed-the-Plough was nothing loath, and in a short time they
      were following the two lads on the road to Bursley, while a horizontal
      blaze shot across the autumn and from the Western edge of the rain-cloud.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Search for the missing boys had been made everywhere over Raynham, and Sir
      Austin was in grievous discontent. None had seen them save Austin
      Wentworth and Mr. Morton. The baronet sat construing their account of the
      flight of the lads when they were hailed, and resolved it into an act of
      rebellion on the part of his son. At dinner he drank the young heir&rsquo;s
      health in ominous silence. Adrian Harley stood up in his place to propose
      the health. His speech was a fine piece of rhetoric. He warmed in it till,
      after the Ciceronic model, inanimate objects were personified, and
      Richard&rsquo;s table-napkin and vacant chair were invoked to follow the steps
      of a peerless father, and uphold with his dignity the honour of the
      Feverels. Austin Wentworth, whom a soldier&rsquo;s death compelled to take his
      father&rsquo;s place in support of the toast, was tame after such magniloquence.
      But the reply, the thanks which young Richard should have delivered in
      person were not forthcoming. Adrian&rsquo;s oratory had given but a momentary
      life to napkin and chair. The company of honoured friends, and aunts and
      uncles, remotest cousins, were glad to disperse and seek amusement in
      music and tea. Sir Austin did his utmost to be hospitable cheerful, and
      requested them to dance. If he had desired them to laugh he would have
      been obeyed, and in as hearty a manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How triste!&rdquo; said Mrs. Doria Forey to Lobourne&rsquo;s curate, as that most
      enamoured automaton went through his paces beside her with professional
      stiffness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One who does not suffer can hardly assent,&rdquo; the curate answered, basking
      in her beams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you are good!&rdquo; exclaimed the lady. &ldquo;Look at my Clare. She will not
      dance on her cousin&rsquo;s birthday with anyone but him. What are we to do to
      enliven these people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, madam! you cannot do for all what you do for one,&rdquo; the curate
      sighed, and wherever she wandered in discourse, drew her back with silken
      strings to gaze on his enamoured soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the only gratified stranger present. The others had designs on the
      young heir. Lady Attenbury of Longford House had brought her
      highly-polished specimen of market-ware, the Lady Juliana Jaye, for a
      first introduction to him, thinking he had arrived at an age to estimate
      and pine for her black eyes and pretty pert mouth. The Lady Juliana had to
      pair off with a dapper Papworth, and her mama was subjected to the
      gallantries of Sir Miles, who talked land and steam-engines to her till
      she was sick, and had to be impertinent in self-defence. Lady Blandish,
      the delightful widow, sat apart with Adrian, and enjoyed his sarcasms on
      the company. By ten at night the poor show ended, and the rooms were dark,
      dark as the prognostics multitudinously hinted by the disappointed and
      chilled guests concerning the probable future of the hope of Raynham.
      Little Clare kissed her mama, curtsied to the lingering curate, and went
      to bed like a very good girl. Immediately the maid had departed, little
      Clare deliberately exchanged night, attire for that of day. She was noted
      as an obedient child. Her light was allowed to burn in her room for
      half-an-hour, to counteract her fears of the dark. She took the light, and
      stole on tiptoe to Richard&rsquo;s room. No Richard was there. She peeped in
      further and further. A trifling agitation of the curtains shot her back
      through the door and along the passage to her own bedchamber with extreme
      expedition. She was not much alarmed, but feeling guilty she was on her
      guard. In a short time she was prowling about the passages again. Richard
      had slighted and offended the little lady, and was to be asked whether he
      did not repent such conduct toward his cousin; not to be asked whether he
      had forgotten to receive his birthday kiss from her; for, if he did not
      choose to remember that, Miss Clare would never remind him of it, and
      to-night should be his last chance of a reconciliation. Thus she
      meditated, sitting on a stair, and presently heard Richard&rsquo;s voice below
      in the hall, shouting for supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master Richard has returned,&rdquo; old Benson the butler tolled out
      intelligence to Sir Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the baronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He complains of being hungry,&rdquo; the butler hesitated, with a look of
      solemn disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heavy Benson hesitated still more as he announced that the boy had called
      for wine. It was an unprecedented thing. Sir Austin&rsquo;s brows were
      portending an arch, but Adrian suggested that he wanted possibly to drink
      his birthday, and claret was conceded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys were in the vortex of a partridge-pie when Adrian strolled in to
      them. They had now changed characters. Richard was uproarious. He drank a
      health with every glass; his cheeks were flushed and his eyes brilliant.
      Ripton looked very much like a rogue on the tremble of detection, but his
      honest hunger and the partridge-pie shielded him awhile from Adrian&rsquo;s
      scrutinizing glance. Adrian saw there was matter for study, if it were
      only on Master Ripton&rsquo;s betraying nose, and sat down to hear and mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good sport, gentlemen, I trust to hear?&rdquo; he began his quiet banter, and
      provoked a loud peal of laughter from Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha! I say, Rip: &lsquo;Havin&rsquo; good sport, gentlemen, are ye?&rsquo; You remember
      the farmer! Your health, parson! We haven&rsquo;t had our sport yet. We&rsquo;re going
      to have some first-rate sport. Oh, well! we haven&rsquo;t much show of birds. We
      shot for pleasure, and returned them to the proprietors. You&rsquo;re fond of
      game, parson! Ripton is a dead shot in what Cousin Austin calls the
      Kingdom of &lsquo;would-have-done&rsquo; and &lsquo;might-have-been.&rsquo; Up went the birds, and
      cries Rip, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve forgotten to load!&rsquo; Oh, ho!&mdash;Rip! some more claret.&mdash;Do
      just leave that nose of yours alone.&mdash;Your health, Ripton Thompson!
      The birds hadn&rsquo;t the decency to wait for him, and so, parson, it&rsquo;s their
      fault, and not Rip&rsquo;s, you haven&rsquo;t a dozen brace at your feet. What have
      you been doing at home, Cousin Rady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Playing Hamlet, in the absence of the Prince of Denmark. The day without
      you, my dear boy, must be dull, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;He speaks: can I trust what he says is sincere?
   There&rsquo;s an edge to his smile that cuts much like a sneer.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sandoe&rsquo;s poems! You know the couplet, Mr. Rady. Why shouldn&rsquo;t I quote
      Sandoe? You know you like him, Rady. But, if you&rsquo;ve missed me, I&rsquo;m sorry.
      Rip and I have had a beautiful day. We&rsquo;ve made new acquaintances. We&rsquo;ve
      seen the world. I&rsquo;m the monkey that has seen the world, and I&rsquo;m going to
      tell you all about it. First, there&rsquo;s a gentleman who takes a rifle for a
      fowling-piece. Next, there&rsquo;s a farmer who warns everybody, gentleman and
      beggar, off his premises. Next, there&rsquo;s a tinker and a ploughman, who
      think that God is always fighting with the devil which shall command the
      kingdoms of the earth. The tinker&rsquo;s for God, and the ploughman&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drink your health, Ricky,&rdquo; said Adrian, interrupting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I forgot, parson;&mdash;I mean no harm, Adrian. I&rsquo;m only telling what
      I&rsquo;ve heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No harm, my dear boy,&rdquo; returned Adrian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly aware that
      Zoroaster is not dead. You have been listening to a common creed. Drink
      the Fire-worshippers, if you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to Zoroaster, then!&rdquo; cried Richard. &ldquo;I say, Rippy! we&rsquo;ll drink the
      Fire-worshippers to-night won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fearful conspiratorial frown, that would not have disgraced Guido
      Fawkes, was darted back from the plastic features of Master Ripton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard gave his lungs loud play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what did you say about Blaizes, Rippy? Didn&rsquo;t you say it was fun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another hideous and silencing frown was Ripton&rsquo;s answer. Adrian matched
      the innocent youths, and knew that there was talking under the table.
      &ldquo;See,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;this boy has tasted his first scraggy morsel of life
      today, and already he talks like an old stager, and has, if I mistake not,
      been acting too. My respected chief,&rdquo; he apostrophized Sir Austin,
      &ldquo;combustibles are only the more dangerous for compression. This boy will
      be ravenous for Earth when he is let loose, and very soon make his share
      of it look as foolish as yonder game-pie!&rdquo;&mdash;a prophecy Adrian kept to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Algernon shambled in to see his nephew before the supper was
      finished, and his more genial presence brought out a little of the plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, uncle!&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;Would you let a churlish old brute of a
      farmer strike you without making him suffer for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy I should return the compliment, my lad,&rdquo; replied his uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you would! So would I. And he shall suffer for it.&rdquo; The boy
      looked savage, and his uncle patted him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve boxed his son; I&rsquo;ll box him,&rdquo; said Richard, shouting for more wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, boy! Is it old Blaize has been putting you up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, uncle!&rdquo; The boy nodded mysteriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look there!&rsquo; Adrian read on Ripton&rsquo;s face, he says &lsquo;never mind,&rsquo; and lets
      it out!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did we beat to-day, uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, boy; and we&rsquo;d beat them any day they bowl fair. I&rsquo;d beat them on one
      leg. There&rsquo;s only Watkins and Featherdene among them worth a farthing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We beat!&rdquo; cries Richard. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have some more wine, and drink their
      healths.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bell was rung; wine ordered. Presently comes in heavy Benson, to say
      supplies are cut off. One bottle, and no more. The Captain whistled:
      Adrian shrugged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bottle, however, was procured by Adrian subsequently. He liked
      studying intoxicated urchins.
    </p>
    <p>
      One subject was at Richard&rsquo;s heart, about which he was reserved in the
      midst of his riot. Too proud to inquire how his father had taken his
      absence, he burned to hear whether he was in disgrace. He led to it
      repeatedly, and it was constantly evaded by Algernon and Adrian. At last,
      when the boy declared a desire to wish his father good-night, Adrian had
      to tell him that he was to go straight to bed from the supper-table. Young
      Richard&rsquo;s face fell at that, and his gaiety forsook him. He marched to his
      room without another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian gave Sir Austin an able version of his son&rsquo;s behaviour and
      adventures; dwelling upon this sudden taciturnity when he heard of his
      father&rsquo;s resolution not to see him. The wise youth saw that his chief was
      mollified behind his moveless mask, and went to bed, and Horace, leaving
      Sir Austin in his study. Long hours the baronet sat alone. The house had
      not its usual influx of Feverels that day. Austin Wentworth was staying at
      Poer Hall, and had only come over for an hour. At midnight the house
      breathed sleep. Sir Austin put on his cloak and cap, and took the lamp to
      make his rounds. He apprehended nothing special, but with a mind never at
      rest he constituted himself the sentinel of Raynham. He passed the chamber
      where the Great-Aunt Grantley lay, who was to swell Richard&rsquo;s fortune, and
      so perform her chief business on earth. By her door he murmured, &ldquo;Good
      creature! you sleep with a sense of duty done,&rdquo; and paced on, reflecting,
      &ldquo;She has not made money a demon of discord,&rdquo; and blessed her. He had his
      thoughts at Hippias&rsquo;s somnolent door, and to them the world might have
      subscribed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A monomaniac at large, watching over sane people in slumber! thinks Adrian
      Harley, as he hears Sir Austin&rsquo;s footfall, and truly that was a strange
      object to see.&mdash;Where is the fortress that has not one weak gate?
      where the man who is sound at each particular angle? Ay, meditates the
      recumbent cynic, more or less mad is not every mother&rsquo;s son? Favourable
      circumstances&mdash;good air, good company, two or three good rules
      rigidly adhered to&mdash;keep the world out of Bedlam. But, let the world
      fly into a passion, and is not Bedlam the safest abode for it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin ascended the stairs, and bent his steps leisurely toward the
      chamber where his son was lying in the left wing of the Abbey. At the end
      of the gallery which led to it he discovered a dim light. Doubting it an
      illusion, Sir Austin accelerated his pace. This wing had aforetime a bad
      character. Notwithstanding what years had done to polish it into fair
      repute, the Raynham kitchen stuck to tradition, and preserved certain
      stories of ghosts seen there, that effectually blackened it in the
      susceptible minds of new house-maids and under-crooks, whose fears would
      not allow the sinner to wash his sins. Sir Austin had heard of the tales
      circulated by his domestics underground. He cherished his own belief, but
      discouraged theirs, and it was treason at Raynham to be caught traducing
      the left wing. As the baronet advanced, the fact of a light burning was
      clear to him. A slight descent brought him into the passage, and he beheld
      a poor human candle standing outside his son&rsquo;s chamber. At the same moment
      a door closed hastily. He entered Richard&rsquo;s room. The boy was absent. The
      bed was unpressed: no clothes about: nothing to show that he had been
      there that night. Sir Austin felt vaguely apprehensive. Has he gone to my
      room to await me? thought the father&rsquo;s heart. Something like a tear
      quivered in his arid eyes as he meditated and hoped this might be so. His
      own sleeping-room faced that of his son. He strode to it with a quick
      heart. It was empty. Alarm dislodged anger from his jealous heart, and
      dread of evil put a thousand questions to him that were answered in air.
      After pacing up and down his room he determined to go and ask the boy
      Thompson, as he called Ripton, what was known to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chamber assigned to Master Ripton Thompson was at the northern
      extremity of the passage, and overlooked Lobourne and the valley to the
      West. The bed stood between the window and the door. Six Austin found the
      door ajar, and the interior dark. To his surprise, the boy Thompson&rsquo;s
      couch, as revealed by the rays of his lamp, was likewise vacant. He was
      turning back when he fancied he heard the sibilation of a whispering in
      the room. Sir Austin cloaked the lamp and trod silently toward the window.
      The heads of his son Richard and the boy Thompson were seen crouched
      against the glass, holding excited converse together. Sir Austin listened,
      but he listened to a language of which he possessed not the key. Their
      talk was of fire, and of delay: of expected agrarian astonishment: of a
      farmer&rsquo;s huge wrath: of violence exercised upon gentlemen, and of
      vengeance: talk that the boys jerked out by fits, and that came as broken
      links of a chain impossible to connect. But they awake curiosity. The
      baronet condescended to play the spy upon his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over Lobourne and the valley lay black night and innumerable stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How jolly I feel!&rdquo; exclaimed Ripton, inspired by claret; and then, after
      a luxurious pause&mdash;&ldquo;I think that fellow has pocketed his guinea, and
      cut his lucky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard allowed a long minute to pass, during which the baronet waited
      anxiously for his voice, hardly recognizing it when he heard its altered
      tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he has, I&rsquo;ll go; and I&rsquo;ll do it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would?&rdquo; returned Master Ripton. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m hanged!&mdash;I say, if
      you went to school, wouldn&rsquo;t you get into rows! Perhaps he hasn&rsquo;t found
      the place where the box was stuck in. I think he funks it. I almost wish
      you hadn&rsquo;t done it, upon my honour&mdash;eh? Look there! what was that?
      That looked like something.&mdash;I say! do you think we shall ever be
      found out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Master Ripton intoned this abrupt interrogation verb seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think about it,&rdquo; said Richard, all his faculties bent on signs
      from Lobourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; Ripton persisted, &ldquo;suppose we are found out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we are, I must pay for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin breathed the better for this reply. He was beginning to gather
      a clue to the dialogue. His son was engaged in a plot, and was, moreover,
      the leader of the plot. He listened for further enlightenment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the fellow&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; inquired Ripton.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion answered, &ldquo;Tom Bakewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; continued Ripton. &ldquo;You let it all clean out to your
      cousin and uncle at supper.&mdash;How capital claret is with
      partridge-pie! What a lot I ate!&mdash;Didn&rsquo;t you see me frown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young sensualist was in an ecstasy of gratitude to his late refection,
      and the slightest word recalled him to it. Richard answered him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and felt your kick. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. Rady&rsquo;s safe, and uncle never
      blabs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my plan is to keep it close. You&rsquo;re never safe if you don&rsquo;t.&mdash;I
      never drank much claret before,&rdquo; Ripton was off again. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t I now,
      though! claret&rsquo;s my wine. You know, it may come out any day, and then
      we&rsquo;re done for,&rdquo; he rather incongruously appended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard only took up the business-thread of his friend&rsquo;s rambling chatter,
      and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got nothing to do with it, if we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I, though! I didn&rsquo;t stick-in the box but I&rsquo;m an accomplice,
      that&rsquo;s clear. Besides,&rdquo; added Ripton, &ldquo;do you think I should leave you to
      bear it all on your shoulders? I ain&rsquo;t that sort of chap, Ricky, I can
      tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin thought more highly of the boy Thompson. Still it looked a
      detestable conspiracy, and the altered manner of his son impressed him
      strangely. He was not the boy of yesterday. To Sir Austin it seemed as if
      a gulf had suddenly opened between them. The boy had embarked, and was on
      the waters of life in his own vessel. It was as vain to call him back as
      to attempt to erase what Time has written with the Judgment Blood! This
      child, for whom he had prayed nightly in such a fervour and humbleness to
      God, the dangers were about him, the temptations thick on him, and the
      devil on board piloting. If a day had done so much, what would years do?
      Were prayers and all the watchfulness he had expended of no avail?
    </p>
    <p>
      A sensation of infinite melancholy overcame the poor gentleman&mdash;a
      thought that he was fighting with a fate in this beloved boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was half disposed to arrest the two conspirators on the spot, and make
      them confess, and absolve themselves; but it seemed to him better to keep
      an unseen eye over his son: Sir Austin&rsquo;s old system prevailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian characterized this system well, in saying that Sir Austin wished to
      be Providence to his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      If immeasurable love were perfect wisdom, one human being might almost
      impersonate Providence to another. Alas! love, divine as it is, can do no
      more than lighten the house it inhabits&mdash;must take its shape,
      sometimes intensify its narrowness&mdash;can spiritualize, but not expel,
      the old lifelong lodgers above-stairs and below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin decided to continue quiescent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The valley still lay black beneath the large autumnal stars, and the
      exclamations of the boys were becoming fevered and impatient. By-and-by
      one insisted that he had seen a twinkle. The direction he gave was out of
      their anticipations. Again the twinkle was announced. Both boys started to
      their feet. It was a twinkle in the right direction now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s done it!&rdquo; cried Richard, in great heat. &ldquo;Now you may say old
      Blaize&rsquo;ll soon be old Blazes, Rip. I hope he&rsquo;s asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s snoring!&mdash;Look there! He&rsquo;s alight fast enough. He&rsquo;s
      dry. He&rsquo;ll burn.&mdash;I say,&rdquo; Ripton re-assumed the serious intonation,
      &ldquo;do you think they&rsquo;ll ever suspect us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if they do? We must brunt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we will. But, I say! I wish you hadn&rsquo;t given them the scent,
      though. I like to look innocent. I can&rsquo;t when I know people suspect me.
      Lord! look there! Isn&rsquo;t it just beginning to flare up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The farmer&rsquo;s grounds were indeed gradually standing out in sombre shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fetch my telescope,&rdquo; said Richard. Ripton, somehow not liking to be
      left alone, caught hold of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; don&rsquo;t go and lose the best of it. Here, I&rsquo;ll throw open the window,
      and we can see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The window was flung open, and the boys instantly stretched half their
      bodies out of it; Ripton appearing to devour the rising flames with his
      mouth: Richard with his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opaque and statuesque stood the figure of the baronet behind them. The
      wind was low. Dense masses of smoke hung amid the darting snakes of fire,
      and a red malign light was on the neighbouring leafage. No figures could
      be seen. Apparently the flames had nothing to contend against, for they
      were making terrible strides into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; shouted Richard, overcome by excitement, &ldquo;if I had my telescope! We
      must have it! Let me go and fetch it! I Will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys struggled together, and Sir Austin stepped back. As he did so, a
      cry was heard in the passage. He hurried out, closed the chamber, and came
      upon little Clare lying senseless along the door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the morning that followed this night, great gossip was interchanged
      between Raynham and Lobourne. The village told how Farmer Blaize, of
      Belthorpe Farm, had his Pick feloniously set fire to; his stables had
      caught fire, himself had been all but roasted alive in the attempt to
      rescue his cattle, of which numbers had perished in the flames. Raynham
      counterbalanced arson with an authentic ghost seen by Miss Clare in the
      left wing of the Abbey&mdash;the ghost of a lady, dressed in deep
      mourning, a scar on her forehead and a bloody handkerchief at her breast,
      frightful to behold! and no wonder the child was frightened out of her
      wits, and lay in a desperate state awaiting the arrival of the London
      doctors. It was added that the servants had all threatened to leave in a
      body, and that Sir Austin to appease them had promised to pull down the
      entire left wing, like a gentleman; for no decent creature, said Lobourne,
      could consent to live in a haunted house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rumour for the nonce had a stronger spice of truth than usual. Poor little
      Clare lay ill, and the calamity that had befallen Farmer Blaize, as
      regards his rick, was not much exaggerated. Sir Austin caused an account
      of it be given him at breakfast, and appeared so scrupulously anxious to
      hear the exact extent of injury sustained by the farmer that heavy Benson
      went down to inspect the scene. Mr. Benson returned, and, acting under
      Adrian&rsquo;s malicious advice, framed a formal report of the catastrophe, in
      which the farmer&rsquo;s breeches figured, and certain cooling applications to a
      part of the farmer&rsquo;s person. Sir Austin perused it without a smile. He
      took occasion to have it read out before the two boys, who listened very
      demurely, as to ordinary newspaper incident; only when the report
      particularized the garments damaged, and the unwonted distressing position
      Farmer Blaize was reduced to in his bed, indecorous fit of sneezing laid
      hold of Master Ripton Thompson, and Richard bit his lip and burst into
      loud laughter, Ripton joining him, lost to consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust you feel for this poor man,&rdquo; said Sir Austin to his son, somewhat
      sternly. He saw no sign of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a difficult task for Sir Austin to keep his old countenance toward
      the hope of Raynham, knowing him the accomplice-incendiary, and believing
      the deed to have been unprovoked and wanton. But he must do so, he knew,
      to let the boy have a fair trial against himself. Be it said, moreover,
      that the baronet&rsquo;s possession of his son&rsquo;s secret flattered him. It
      allowed him to act, and in a measure to feel, like Providence; enabled him
      to observe and provide for the movements of creatures in the dark. He
      therefore treated the boy as he commonly did, and Richard saw no change in
      his father to make him think he was suspected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youngster&rsquo;s game was not so easy against Adrian. Adrian did not shoot
      or fish. Voluntarily he did nothing to work off the destructive nervous
      fluid, or whatever it may be, which is in man&rsquo;s nature; so that two
      culprit boys once in his power were not likely to taste the gentle hand of
      mercy; and Richard and Ripton paid for many a trout and partridge spared.
      At every minute of the day Ripton was thrown into sweats of suspicion that
      discovery was imminent, by some stray remark or message from Adrian. He
      was as a fish with the hook in his gills, mysteriously caught without
      having nibbled; and dive into what depths he would he was sensible of a
      summoning force that compelled him perpetually towards the gasping
      surface, which he seemed inevitably approaching when the dinner-bell
      sounded. There the talk was all of Farmer Blaize. If it dropped, Adrian
      revived it, and his caressing way with Ripton was just such as a keen
      sportsman feels toward the creature that had owned his skill, and is
      making its appearance for the world to acknowledge the same. Sir Austin
      saw the manoeuvres, and admired Adrian&rsquo;s shrewdness. But he had to check
      the young natural lawyer, for the effect of so much masked examination
      upon Richard was growing baneful. This fish also felt the hook in his
      gills, but this fish was more of a pike, and lay in different waters,
      where there were old stumps and black roots to wind about, and defy alike
      strong pulling and delicate handling. In other words, Richard showed
      symptoms of a disposition to take refuge in lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the grounds, my dear boy,&rdquo; Adrian observed to him. &ldquo;Tell me; do
      you think it easy to get to the rick unperceived? I hear they suspect one
      of the farmer&rsquo;s turned-off hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I don&rsquo;t know the grounds,&rdquo; Richard sullenly replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not?&rdquo; Adrian counterfeited courteous astonishment. &ldquo;I thought Mr.
      Thompson said you were over there yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton, glad to speak the truth, hurriedly assured Adrian that it was not
      he had said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not? You had good sport, gentlemen, hadn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; mumbled the wretched victims, reddening as they remembered, in
      Adrian&rsquo;s slightly drawled rusticity of tone, Farmer Blaize&rsquo;s first address
      to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you were among the Fire-worshippers last night, too?&rdquo; persisted
      Adrian. &ldquo;In some countries, I hear, they manage their best sport at
      night-time, and beat up for game with torches. It must be a fine sight.
      After all, the country would be dull if we hadn&rsquo;t a rip here and there to
      treat us to a little conflagration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rip!&rdquo; laughed Richard, to his friend&rsquo;s disgust and alarm at his daring.
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean this Rip, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Thompson fire a rick? I should as soon suspect you, my dear boy.&mdash;You
      are aware, young gentlemen, that it is rather a serious thing eh? In this
      country, you know, the landlord has always been the pet of the Laws. By
      the way,&rdquo; Adrian continued, as if diverging to another topic, &ldquo;you met two
      gentlemen of the road in your explorations yesterday, Magians. Now, if I
      were a magistrate of the county, like Sir Miles Papworth, my suspicions
      would light upon those gentlemen. A tinker and a ploughman, I think you
      said, Mr. Thompson. Not? Well, say two ploughmen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More likely two tinkers,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if you wish to exclude the ploughman&mdash;was he out of employ?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton, with Adrian&rsquo;s eyes inveterately fixed on him, stammered an
      affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tinker, or the ploughman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ploughm&mdash;&rdquo; Ingenuous Ripton looking about, as if to aid himself
      whenever he was able to speak the truth, beheld Richard&rsquo;s face blackening
      at him, and swallowed back half the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ploughman!&rdquo; Adrian took him up cheerily. &ldquo;Then we have here a
      ploughman out of employ. Given a ploughman out of employ, and a rick
      burnt. The burning of a rick is an act of vengeance, and a ploughman out
      of employ is a vengeful animal. The rick and the ploughman are advancing
      to a juxtaposition. Motive being established, we have only to prove their
      proximity at a certain hour, and our ploughman voyages beyond seas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it transportation for rick-burning?&rdquo; inquired Ripton aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian spoke solemnly: &ldquo;They shave your head. You are manacled. Your diet
      is sour bread and cheese-parings. You work in strings of twenties and
      thirties. ARSON is branded on your backs in an enormous A. Theological
      works are the sole literary recreation of the well-conducted and
      deserving. Consider the fate of this poor fellow, and what an act of
      vengeance brings him to! Do you know his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I know his name?&rdquo; said Richard, with an assumption of
      innocence painful to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin remarked that no doubt it would soon be known, and Adrian
      perceived that he was to quiet his line, marvelling a little at the
      baronet&rsquo;s blindness to what was so clear. He would not tell, for that
      would ruin his influence with Richard; still he wanted some present credit
      for his discernment and devotion. The boys got away from dinner, and,
      after deep consultation, agreed upon a course of conduct, which was to
      commiserate with Farmer Blaize loudly, and make themselves look as much
      like the public as it was possible for two young malefactors to look, one
      of whom already felt Adrian&rsquo;s enormous A devouring his back with the
      fierceness of the Promethean eagle, and isolating him forever from
      mankind. Adrian relished their novel tactics sharply, and led them to
      lengths of lamentation for Farmer Blaize. Do what they might, the hook was
      in their gills. The farmer&rsquo;s whip had reduced them to bodily contortions;
      these were decorous compared with the spiritual writhings they had to
      perform under Adrian&rsquo;s manipulation. Ripton was fast becoming a coward,
      and Richard a liar, when next morning Austin Wentworth came over from Poer
      Hall bringing news that one Mr. Thomas Bakewell, yeoman, had been arrested
      on suspicion of the crime of Arson and lodged in jail, awaiting the
      magisterial pleasure of Sir Miles Papworth. Austin&rsquo;s eye rested on Richard
      as he spoke these terrible tidings. The hope of Raynham returned his look,
      perfectly calm, and had, moreover, the presence of mind not to look at
      Ripton.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      As soon as they could escape, the boys got together into an obscure corner
      of the park, and there took counsel of their extremity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever shall we do now?&rdquo; asked Ripton of his leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scorpion girt with fire was never in a more terrible prison-house than
      poor Ripton, around whom the raging element he had assisted to create
      seemed to be drawing momently narrower circles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one chance,&rdquo; said Richard, coming to a dead halt, and
      folding his arms resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      His comrade inquired with the utmost eagerness what that chance might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard fixed his eyes on a flint, and replied: &ldquo;We must rescue that
      fellow from jail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton gazed at his leader, and fell back with astonishment. &ldquo;My dear
      Ricky! but how are we to do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard, still perusing his flint, replied: &ldquo;We must manage to get a file
      in to him and a rope. It can be done, I tell you. I don&rsquo;t care what I pay.
      I don&rsquo;t care what I do. He must be got out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bother that old Blaize!&rdquo; exclaimed Ripton, taking off his cap to wipe his
      frenzied forehead, and brought down his friend&rsquo;s reproof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind old Blaize now. Talk about letting it out! Look at you. I&rsquo;m
      ashamed of you. You talk about Robin Hood and King Richard! Why, you
      haven&rsquo;t an atom of courage. Why, you let it out every second of the day.
      Whenever Rady begins speaking you start; I can see the perspiration
      rolling down you. Are you afraid?&mdash;And then you contradict yourself.
      You never keep to one story. Now, follow me. We must risk everything to
      get him out. Mind that! And keep out of Adrian&rsquo;s way as much as you can.
      And keep to one story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these sage directions the young leader marched his companion-culprit
      down to inspect the jail where Tom Bakewell lay groaning over the results
      of the super-mundane conflict, and the victim of it that he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Lobourne Austin Wentworth had the reputation of the poor man&rsquo;s friend;
      a title he earned more largely ere he went to the reward God alone can
      give to that supreme virtue. Dame Bakewell, the mother of Tom, on hearing
      of her son&rsquo;s arrest, had run to comfort him and render him what help she
      could; but this was only sighs and tears, and, oh deary me! which only
      perplexed poor Tom, who bade her leave an unlucky chap to his fate, and
      not make himself a thundering villain. Whereat the dame begged him to take
      heart, and he should have a true comforter. &ldquo;And though it&rsquo;s a gentleman
      that&rsquo;s coming to you, Tom&mdash;for he never refuses a poor body,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Bakewell, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a true Christian, Tom! and the Lord knows if the
      sight of him mayn&rsquo;t be the saving of you, for he&rsquo;s light to look on, and a
      sermon to listen to, he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom was not prepossessed by the prospect of a sermon, and looked a sullen
      dog enough when Austin entered his cell. He was surprised at the end of
      half-an-hour to find himself engaged in man-to-man conversation with a
      gentleman and a Christian. When Austin rose to go Tom begged permission to
      shake his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take and tell young master up at the Abbey that I an&rsquo;t the chap to peach.
      He&rsquo;ll know. He&rsquo;s a young gentleman as&rsquo;ll make any man do as he wants &lsquo;em!
      He&rsquo;s a mortal wild young gentleman! And I&rsquo;m a Ass! That&rsquo;s where &lsquo;tis. But
      I an&rsquo;t a blackguard. Tell him that, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was how it came that Austin eyed young Richard seriously while he
      told the news at Raynham. The boy was shy of Austin more than of Adrian.
      Why, he did not know; but he made it a hard task for Austin to catch him
      alone, and turned sulky that instant. Austin was not clever like Adrian:
      he seldom divined other people&rsquo;s ideas, and always went the direct road to
      his object; so instead of beating about and setting the boy on the alert
      at all points, crammed to the muzzle with lies, he just said, &ldquo;Tom
      Bakewell told me to let you know he does not intend to peach on you,&rdquo; and
      left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard repeated the intelligence to Ripton, who cried aloud that Tom was
      a brick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shan&rsquo;t suffer for it,&rdquo; said Richard, and pondered on a thicker rope
      and sharper file.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will your cousin tell?&rdquo; was Ripton&rsquo;s reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He!&rdquo; Richard&rsquo;s lip expressed contempt. &ldquo;A ploughman refuses to peach, and
      you ask if one of our family will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton stood for the twentieth time reproved on this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys had examined the outer walls of the jail, and arrived at the
      conclusion that Tom&rsquo;s escape might be managed if Tom had spirit, and the
      rope and file could be anyway reached to him. But to do this, somebody
      must gain admittance to his cell, and who was to be taken into their
      confidence?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try your cousin,&rdquo; Ripton suggested, after much debate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard, smiling, wished to know if he meant Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Ripton hurriedly reassured him. &ldquo;Austin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same idea was knocking at Richard&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get the rope and file first,&rdquo; said he, and to Bursley they went for
      those implements to defeat the law, Ripton procuring the file at one shop
      and Richard the rope at another, with such masterly cunning did they lay
      their measures for the avoidance of every possible chance of detection.
      And better to assure this, in a wood outside Bursley Richard stripped to
      his shirt and wound the rope round his body, tasting the tortures of
      anchorites and penitential friars, that nothing should be risked to make
      Tom&rsquo;s escape a certainty. Sir Austin saw the marks at night as his son lay
      asleep, through the half-opened folds of his bed-gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a severe stroke when, after all their stratagems and trouble,
      Austin Wentworth refused the office the boys had zealously designed for
      him. Time pressed. In a few days poor Tom would have to face the
      redoubtable Sir Miles, and get committed, for rumours of overwhelming
      evidence to convict him were rife about Lobourne, and Farmer Blaize&rsquo;s
      wrath was unappeasable. Again and again young Richard begged his cousin
      not to see him disgraced, and to help him in this extremity. Austin smiled
      on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Ricky,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there are two ways of getting out of a scrape:
      a long way and a short way. When you&rsquo;ve tried the roundabout method, and
      failed, come to me, and I&rsquo;ll show you the straight route.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard was too entirely bent upon the roundabout method to consider this
      advice more than empty words, and only ground his teeth at Austin&rsquo;s unkind
      refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He imparted to Ripton, at the eleventh hour, that they must do it
      themselves, to which Ripton heavily assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day preceding poor Tom&rsquo;s doomed appearance before the magistrate,
      Dame Bakewell had an interview with Austin, who went to Raynham
      immediately, and sought Adrian&rsquo;s counsel upon what was to be done. Homeric
      laughter and nothing else could be got out of Adrian when he heard of the
      doings of these desperate boys: how they had entered Dame Bakewell&rsquo;s
      smallest of retail shops, and purchased tea, sugar, candles, and comfits
      of every description, till the shop was clear of customers: how they had
      then hurried her into her little back-parlour, where Richard had torn open
      his shirt and revealed the coils of rope, and Ripton displayed the point
      of a file from a serpentine recess in his jacket: how they had then told
      the astonished woman that the rope she saw and the file she saw were
      instruments for the liberation of her son; that there existed no other
      means on earth to save him, they, the boys, having unsuccessfully
      attempted all: how upon that Richard had tried with the utmost earnestness
      to persuade her to disrobe and wind the rope round her own person: and
      Ripton had aired his eloquence to induce her to secrete the file: how,
      when she resolutely objected to the rope, both boys began backing the
      file, and in an evil hour, she feared, said Dame Bakewell, she had
      rewarded the gracious permission given her by Sir Miles Papworth to visit
      her son, by tempting Tom to file the Law. Though, thanks be to the Lord!
      Dame Bakewell added, Tom had turned up his nose at the file, and so she
      had told young Master Richard, who swore very bad for a young gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys are like monkeys,&rdquo; remarked Adrian, at the close of his explosions,
      &ldquo;the gravest actors of farcical nonsense that the world possesses. May I
      never be where there are no boys! A couple of boys left to themselves will
      furnish richer fun than any troop of trained comedians. No: no Art arrives
      at the artlessness of nature in matters of comedy. You can&rsquo;t simulate the
      ape. Your antics are dull. They haven&rsquo;t the charming inconsequence of the
      natural animal. Lack at these two! Think of the shifts they are put to all
      day long! They know I know all about it, and yet their serenity of
      innocence is all but unruffled in my presence. You&rsquo;re sorry to think about
      the end of the business, Austin? So am I! I dread the idea of the curtain
      going down. Besides, it will do Ricky a world of good. A practical lesson
      is the best lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sinks deepest,&rdquo; said Austin, &ldquo;but whether he learns good or evil from it
      is the question at stake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian stretched his length at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will be his first nibble at experience, old Time&rsquo;s fruit, hateful to
      the palate of youth! for which season only hath it any nourishment!
      Experience! You know Coleridge&rsquo;s capital simile?&mdash;Mournful you call
      it? Well! all wisdom is mournful. &lsquo;Tis therefore, coz, that the wise do
      love the Comic Muse. Their own high food would kill them. You shall find
      great poets, rare philosophers, night after night on the broad grin before
      a row of yellow lights and mouthing masks. Why? Because all&rsquo;s dark at
      home. The stage is the pastime of great minds. That&rsquo;s how it comes that
      the stage is now down. An age of rampant little minds, my dear Austin! How
      I hate that cant of yours about an Age of Work&mdash;you, and your
      Mortons, and your parsons Brawnley, rank radicals all of you, base
      materialists! What does Diaper Sandoe sing of your Age of Work? Listen!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;An Age of betty tit for tat,
      An Age of busy gabble:
     An Age that&rsquo;s like a brewer&rsquo;s vat,
      Fermenting for the rabble!

     &lsquo;An Age that&rsquo;s chaste in Love, but lax
      To virtuous abuses:
     Whose gentlemen and ladies wax
      Too dainty for their uses.

     &lsquo;An Age that drives an Iron Horse,
      Of Time and Space defiant;
     Exulting in a Giant&rsquo;s Force,
      And trembling at the Giant.

     &lsquo;An Age of Quaker hue and cut,
      By Mammon misbegotten;
     See the mad Hamlet mouth and strut!
      And mark the Kings of Cotton!

     &lsquo;From this unrest, lo, early wreck&rsquo;d,
      A Future staggers crazy,
     Ophelia of the Ages, deck&rsquo;d
      With woeful weed and daisy!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Murmuring, &ldquo;Get your parson Brawnley to answer that!&rdquo; Adrian changed the
      resting-place of a leg, and smiled. The Age was an old battle-field
      between him and Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My parson Brawnley, as you call him, has answered it,&rdquo; said Austin, &ldquo;not
      by hoping his best, which would probably leave the Age to go mad to your
      satisfaction, but by doing it. And he has and will answer your Diaper
      Sandoe in better verse, as he confutes him in a better life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see Sandoe&rsquo;s depth,&rdquo; Adrian replied. &ldquo;Consider that phrase,
      &lsquo;Ophelia of the Ages&rsquo;! Is not Brawnley, like a dozen other leading spirits&mdash;I
      think that&rsquo;s your term just the metaphysical Hamlet to drive her mad? She,
      poor maid! asks for marriage and smiling babes, while my lord lover stands
      questioning the Infinite, and rants to the Impalpable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Austin laughed. &ldquo;Marriage and smiling babes she would have in abundance,
      if Brawnley legislated. Wait till you know him. He will be over at Poer
      Hall shortly, and you will see what a Man of the Age means. But now, pray,
      consult with me about these boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, those boys!&rdquo; Adrian tossed a hand. &ldquo;Are there boys of the Age as well
      as men? Not? Then boys are better than men: boys are for all Ages. What do
      you think, Austin? They&rsquo;ve been studying Latude&rsquo;s Escape. I found the book
      open in Ricky&rsquo;s room, on the top of Jonathan Wild. Jonathan preserved the
      secrets of his profession, and taught them nothing. So they&rsquo;re going to
      make a Latude of Mr. Tom Bakewell. He&rsquo;s to be Bastille Bakewell, whether
      he will or no. Let them. Let the wild colt run free! We can&rsquo;t help them.
      We can only look on. We should spoil the play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian always made a point of feeding the fretful beast Impatience with
      pleasantries&mdash;a not congenial diet; and Austin, the most patient of
      human beings, began to lose his self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk as if Time belonged to you, Adrian. We have but a few hours left
      us. Work first, and joke afterwards. The boy&rsquo;s fate is being decided now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So is everybody&rsquo;s, my dear Austin!&rdquo; yawned the epicurean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but this boy is at present under our guardianship&mdash;under yours
      especially.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet! not yet!&rdquo; Adrian interjected languidly. &ldquo;No getting into scrapes
      when I have him. The leash, young hound! the collar, young colt! I&rsquo;m
      perfectly irresponsible at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may have something different to deal with when you are responsible,
      if you think that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take my young prince as I find him, coz: a Julian, or a Caracalla: a
      Constantine, or a Nero. Then, if he will play the fiddle to a
      conflagration, he shall play it well: if he must be a disputatious
      apostate, at any rate he shall understand logic and men, and have the
      habit of saying his prayers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you leave me to act alone?&rdquo; said Austin, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a single curb!&rdquo; Adrian gesticulated an acquiesced withdrawal.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you would not, still more certain you cannot, do harm. And be
      mindful of my prophetic words: Whatever&rsquo;s done, old Blaize will have to be
      bought off. There&rsquo;s the affair settled at once. I suppose I must go to the
      chief to-night and settle it myself. We can&rsquo;t see this poor devil
      condemned, though it&rsquo;s nonsense to talk of a boy being the prime
      instigator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Austin cast an eye at the complacent languor of the wise youth, his
      cousin, and the little that he knew of his fellows told him he might talk
      forever here, and not be comprehended. The wise youth&rsquo;s two ears were
      stuffed with his own wisdom. One evil only Adrian dreaded, it was clear&mdash;the
      action of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was moving away, Adrian called out to him, &ldquo;Stop, Austin! There!
      don&rsquo;t be anxious! You invariably take the glum side. I&rsquo;ve done something.
      Never mind what. If you go down to Belthorpe, be civil, but not
      obsequious. You remember the tactics of Scipio Africanus against the Punic
      elephants? Well, don&rsquo;t say a word&mdash;in thine ear, coz: I&rsquo;ve turned
      Master Blaize&rsquo;s elephants. If they charge, &lsquo;twill bye a feint, and back to
      the destruction of his serried ranks! You understand. Not? Well, &lsquo;tis as
      well. Only, let none say that I sleep. If I must see him to-night, I go
      down knowing he has not got us in his power.&rdquo; The wise youth yawned, and
      stretched out a hand for any book that might be within his reach. Austin
      left him to look about the grounds for Richard.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      A little laurel-shaded temple of white marble looked out on the river from
      a knoll bordering the Raynham beechwoods, and was dubbed by Adrian
      Daphne&rsquo;s Bower. To this spot Richard had retired, and there Austin found
      him with his head buried in his hands, a picture of desperation, whose
      last shift has been defeated. He allowed Austin to greet him and sit by
      him without lifting his head. Perhaps his eyes were not presentable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your friend?&rdquo; Austin began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; was the answer, sounding cavernous from behind hair and fingers.
      An explanation presently followed, that a summons had come for him in the
      morning from Mr. Thompson; and that Mr. Ripton had departed against his
      will.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Ripton had protested that he would defy his parent and remain by
      his friend in the hour of adversity and at the post of danger. Sir Austin
      signified his opinion that a boy should obey his parent, by giving orders
      to Benson for Ripton&rsquo;s box to be packed and ready before noon; and
      Ripton&rsquo;s alacrity in taking the baronet&rsquo;s view of filial duty was as
      little feigned as his offer to Richard to throw filial duty to the winds.
      He rejoiced that the Fates had agreed to remove him from the very hot
      neighbourhood of Lobourne, while he grieved, like an honest lad, to see
      his comrade left to face calamity alone. The boys parted amicably, as they
      could hardly fail to do, when Ripton had sworn fealty to the Feverals with
      a warmth that made him declare himself bond, and due to appear at any
      stated hour and at any stated place to fight all the farmers in England,
      on a mandate from the heir of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re left alone,&rdquo; said Austin, contemplating the boy&rsquo;s shapely head.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it. We never know what&rsquo;s in us till we stand by ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There appeared to be no answer forthcoming. Vanity, however, replied at
      last, &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t much support.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember his good points now he&rsquo;s gone, Ricky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! he was staunch,&rdquo; the boy grumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a staunch friend is not always to be found. Now, have you tried your
      own way of rectifying this business, Ricky?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And failed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, and then the deep-toned evasion&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom Bakewell&rsquo;s a coward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose, poor fellow,&rdquo; said Austin, in his kind way, &ldquo;he doesn&rsquo;t want
      to get into a deeper mess. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s a coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a coward,&rdquo; cried Richard. &ldquo;Do you think if I had a file I would
      stay in prison? I&rsquo;d be out the first night! And he might have had the
      rope, too&mdash;a rope thick enough for a couple of men his size and
      weight. Ripton and I and Ned Markham swung on it for an hour, and it
      didn&rsquo;t give way. He&rsquo;s a coward, and deserves his fate. I&rsquo;ve no compassion
      for a coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I much,&rdquo; said Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard had raised his head in the heat of his denunciation of poor Tom.
      He would have hidden it had he known the thought in Austin&rsquo;s clear eyes
      while he faced them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never met a coward myself,&rdquo; Austin continued. &ldquo;I have heard of one or
      two. One let an innocent man die for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How base!&rdquo; exclaimed the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was bad,&rdquo; Austin acquiesced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad!&rdquo; Richard scorned the poor contempt. &ldquo;How I would have spurned him!
      He was a coward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he pleaded the feelings of his family in his excuse, and tried
      every means to get the man off. I have read also in the confessions of a
      celebrated philosopher, that in his youth he committed some act of
      pilfering, and accused a young servant-girl of his own theft, who was
      condemned and dismissed for it, pardoning her guilty accuser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a coward!&rdquo; shouted Richard. &ldquo;And he confessed it publicly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may read it yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He actually wrote it down, and printed it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the book in your father&rsquo;s library. Would you have done so much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard faltered. No! he admitted that he never could have told people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then who is to call that man a coward?&rdquo; said Austin. &ldquo;He expiated his
      cowardice as all who give way in moments of weakness, and are not cowards,
      must do. The coward chooses to think &lsquo;God does not see.&rsquo; I shall escape.&rsquo; 
      He who is not a coward, and has succumbed, knows that God has seen all,
      and it is not so hard a task for him to make his heart bare to the world.
      Worse, I should fancy it, to know myself an impostor when men praised me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Richard&rsquo;s eyes were wandering on Austin&rsquo;s gravely cheerful face. A
      keen intentness suddenly fixed them, and he dropped his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I think you&rsquo;re wrong, Ricky, in calling this poor Tom a coward because
      he refuses to try your means of escape,&rdquo; Austin resumed. &ldquo;A coward hardly
      objects to drag in his accomplice. And, where the person involved belongs
      to a great family, it seems to me that for a poor plough-lad to volunteer
      not to do so speaks him anything but a coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard was dumb. Altogether to surrender his rope and file was a fearful
      sacrifice, after all the time, trepidation, and study he had spent on
      those two saving instruments. If he avowed Tom&rsquo;s manly behaviour, Richard
      Feverel was in a totally new position. Whereas, by keeping Tom a coward,
      Richard Feverel was the injured one, and to seem injured is always a
      luxury; sometimes a necessity, whether among boys or men.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Austin the Magian conflict would not have lasted long. He had but a
      blind notion of the fierceness with which it raged in young Richard.
      Happily for the boy, Austin was not a preacher. A single instance, a cant
      phrase, a fatherly manner, might have wrecked him, by arousing ancient or
      latent opposition. The born preacher we feel instinctively to be our foe.
      He may do some good to the wretches that have been struck down and lie
      gasping on the battlefield: he rouses antagonism in the strong. Richard&rsquo;s
      nature, left to itself, wanted little more than an indication of the
      proper track, and when he said, &ldquo;Tell me what I can do, Austin?&rdquo; he had
      fought the best half of the battle. His voice was subdued. Austin put his
      hand on the boy&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must go down to Farmer Blaize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Richard, sullenly divining the deed of penance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know what to say to him when you&rsquo;re there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy bit his lip and frowned. &ldquo;Ask a favour of that big brute, Austin?
      I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just tell him the whole case, and that you don&rsquo;t intend to stand by and
      let the poor fellow suffer without a friend to help him out of his
      scrape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Austin,&rdquo; the boy pleaded, &ldquo;I shall have to ask him to help off Tom
      Bakewell! How can I ask him, when I hate him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Austin bade him go, and think nothing of the consequences till he got
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard groaned in soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no pride, Austin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what it is to ask a favour of a brute you hate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard stuck to that view of the case, and stuck to it the faster the
      more imperatively the urgency of a movement dawned upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; continued the boy, &ldquo;I shall hardly be able to keep my fists off
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you&rsquo;ve punished him enough, boy?&rdquo; said Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He struck me!&rdquo; Richard&rsquo;s lip quivered. &ldquo;He dared not come at me with his
      hands. He struck me with a whip. He&rsquo;ll be telling everybody that he
      horsewhipped me, and that I went down and begged his pardon. Begged his
      pardon! A Feverel beg his pardon! Oh, if I had my will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man earns his bread, Ricky. You poached on his grounds. He turned you
      off, and you fired his rick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll pay him for his loss. And I won&rsquo;t do any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you won&rsquo;t ask a favour of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I will not ask a favour of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Austin looked at the boy steadily. &ldquo;You prefer to receive a favour from
      poor Tom Bakewell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At Austin&rsquo;s enunciation of this obverse view of the matter Richard raised
      his brow. Dimly a new light broke in upon him. &ldquo;Favour from Tom Bakewell,
      the ploughman? How do you mean, Austin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To save yourself an unpleasantness you permit a country lad to sacrifice
      himself for you? I confess I should not have so much pride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pride!&rdquo; shouted Richard, stung by the taunt, and set his sight hard at
      the blue ridges of the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not knowing for the moment what else to do, Austin drew a picture of Tom
      in prison, and repeated Tom&rsquo;s volunteer statement. The picture, though his
      intentions were far from designing it so, had to Richard, whose perception
      of humour was infinitely keener, a horrible chaw-bacon smack about it.
      Visions of a grinning lout, open from ear to ear, unkempt, coarse,
      splay-footed, rose before him and afflicted him with the strangest
      sensations of disgust and comicality, mixed up with pity and remorse&mdash;a
      sort of twisted pathos. There lay Tom; hobnail Tom! a bacon-munching,
      reckless, beer-swilling animal! and yet a man; a dear brave human heart
      notwithstanding; capable of devotion and unselfishness. The boy&rsquo;s better
      spirit was touched, and it kindled his imagination to realize the abject
      figure of poor clodpole Tom, and surround it with a halo of mournful
      light. His soul was alive. Feelings he had never known streamed in upon
      him as from an ethereal casement, an unwonted tenderness, an embracing
      humour, a consciousness of some ineffable glory, an irradiation of the
      features of humanity. All this was in the bosom of the boy, and through it
      all the vision of an actual hob-nail Tom, coarse, unkempt, open from ear
      to ear; whose presence was a finger of shame to him and an oppression of
      clodpole; yet toward whom he felt just then a loving-kindness beyond what
      he felt for any living creature. He laughed at him, and wept over him. He
      prized him, while he shrank from him. It was a genial strife of the angel
      in him with constituents less divine; but the angel was uppermost and led
      the van&mdash;extinguished loathing, humanized laughter, transfigured
      pride&mdash;pride that would persistently contemplate the corduroys of
      gaping Tom, and cry to Richard, in the very tone of Adrian&rsquo;s ironic voice,
      &ldquo;Behold your benefactor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Austin sat by the boy, unaware of the sublimer tumult he had stirred.
      Little of it was perceptible in Richard&rsquo;s countenance. The lines of his
      mouth were slightly drawn; his eyes hard set into the distance. He
      remained thus many minutes. Finally he jumped to his legs, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      go at once to old Blaize and tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Austin grasped his hand, and together they issued out of Daphne&rsquo;s Bower,
      in the direction of Lobourne.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Farmer Blaize was not so astonished at the visit of Richard Feverel as
      that young gentleman expected him to be. The farmer, seated in his
      easy-chair in the little low-roofed parlour of an old-fashioned
      farm-house, with a long clay pipe on the table at his elbow, and a veteran
      pointer at his feet, had already given audience to three distinguished
      members of the Feverel blood, who had come separately, according to their
      accustomed secretiveness, and with one object. In the morning it was Sir
      Austin himself. Shortly after his departure, arrived Austin Wentworth;
      close on his heels, Algernon, known about Lobourne as the Captain, popular
      wherever he was known. Farmer Blaize reclined in considerable elation. He
      had brought these great people to a pretty low pitch. He had welcomed them
      hospitably, as a British yeoman should; but not budged a foot in his
      demands: not to the baronet: not to the Captain: not to good young Mr.
      Wentworth. For Farmer Blaize was a solid Englishman; and, on hearing from
      the baronet a frank confession of the hold he had on the family, he
      determined to tighten his hold, and only relax it in exchange for tangible
      advantages&mdash;compensation to his pocket, his wounded person, and his
      still more wounded sentiments: the total indemnity being, in round
      figures, three hundred pounds, and a spoken apology from the prime
      offender, young Mister Richard. Even then there was a reservation.
      Provided, the farmer said, nobody had been tampering with any of his
      witnesses. In that ease Farmer Blaize declared the money might go, and he
      would transport Tom Bakewell, as he had sworn he would. And it goes hard,
      too, with an accomplice, by law, added the farmer, knocking the ashes
      leisurely out of his pipe. He had no wish to bring any disgrace anywhere;
      he respected the inmates of Raynham Abbey, as in duty bound; he should be
      sorry to see them in trouble. Only no tampering with his witnesses. He was
      a man for Law. Rank was much: money was much: but Law was more. In this
      country Law was above the sovereign. To tamper with the Law was treason to
      the realm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come to you direct,&rdquo; the baronet explained. &ldquo;I tell you candidly what
      way I discovered my son to be mixed up in this miserable affair. I promise
      you indemnity for your loss, and an apology that shall, I trust, satisfy
      your feelings, assuring you that to tamper with witnesses is not the
      province of a Feverel. All I ask of you in return is, not to press the
      prosecution. At present it rests with you. I am bound to do all that lies
      in my power for this imprisoned man. How and wherefore my son was prompted
      to suggest, or assist in, such an act, I cannot explain, for I do not
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; said the farmer. &ldquo;I think I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the cause?&rdquo; Sir Austin stared. &ldquo;I beg you to confide it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Least, I can pretty nigh neighbour it with a gues,&rdquo; said the farmer. &ldquo;We
      an&rsquo;t good friends, Sir Austin, me and your son, just now&mdash;not to say
      cordial. I, ye see, Sir Austin, I&rsquo;m a man as don&rsquo;t like young gentlemen
      a-poachin&rsquo; on his grounds without his permission,&mdash;in special when
      birds is plentiful on their own. It appear he do like it. Consequently I
      has to flick this whip&mdash;as them fellers at the races: All in this
      &lsquo;ere Ring&rsquo;s mine! as much as to say; and who&rsquo;s been hit, he&rsquo;s had fair
      warnin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m sorry for&rsquo;t, but that&rsquo;s just the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin retired to communicate with his son, when he should find him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Algernon&rsquo;s interview passed off in ale and promises. He also assured
      Farmer Blaize that no Feverel could be affected by his proviso.
    </p>
    <p>
      No less did Austin Wentworth. The farmer was satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money&rsquo;s safe, I know,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;now for the &lsquo;pology!&rdquo; and Farmer Blaize
      thrust his legs further out, and his head further back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer naturally reflected that the three separate visits had been
      conspired together. Still the baronet&rsquo;s frankness, and the baronet&rsquo;s not
      having reserved himself for the third and final charge, puzzled him. He
      was considering whether they were a deep, or a shallow lot, when young
      Richard was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pretty little girl with the roses of thirteen springs in her cheeks, and
      abundant beautiful bright tresses, tripped before the boy, and loitered
      shyly by the farmer&rsquo;s arm-chair to steal a look at the handsome new-comer.
      She was introduced to Richard as the farmer&rsquo;s niece, Lucy Desborough, the
      daughter of a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, and, what was better, though
      the farmer did not pronounce it so loudly, a real good girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither the excellence of her character, nor her rank in life, tempted
      Richard to inspect the little lady. He made an awkward bow, and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. &ldquo;Her father,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;fought and fell
      for his coontry. A man as fights for&rsquo;s coontry&rsquo;s a right to hould up his
      head&mdash;ay! with any in the land. Desb&rsquo;roughs o&rsquo; Dorset! d&rsquo;ye know that
      family, Master Feverel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard did not know them, and, by his air, did not desire to become
      acquainted with any offshoot of that family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She can make puddens and pies,&rdquo; the farmer went on, regardless of his
      auditor&rsquo;s gloom. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a lady, as good as the best of &lsquo;em. I don&rsquo;t care
      about their being Catholics&mdash;the Desb&rsquo;roughs o&rsquo; Dorset are gentlemen.
      And she&rsquo;s good for the pianer, too! She strums to me of evenin&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m for
      the old tunes: she&rsquo;s for the new. Gal-like! While she&rsquo;s with me she shall
      be taught things use&rsquo;l. She can parley-voo a good &lsquo;un and foot it, as it
      goes; been in France a couple of year. I prefer the singin&rsquo; of &lsquo;t to the
      talkin&rsquo; of &lsquo;t. Come, Luce! toon up&mdash;eh?&mdash;Ye wun&rsquo;t? That song
      abort the Viffendeer&mdash;a female&rdquo;&mdash;Farmer Blaize volunteered the
      translation of the title&mdash;&ldquo;who wears the&mdash;you guess what! and
      marches along with the French sojers: a pretty brazen bit o&rsquo; goods, I sh&rsquo;d
      fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Lucy corrected her uncle&rsquo;s French, but objected to do more.
      The handsome cross boy had almost taken away her voice for speech, as it
      was, and sing in his company she could not; so she stood, a hand on her
      uncle&rsquo;s chair to stay herself from falling, while she wriggled a dozen
      various shapes of refusal, and shook her head at the farmer with fixed
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; laughed the farmer, dismissing her, &ldquo;they soon learn the difference
      &lsquo;twixt the young &lsquo;un and the old &lsquo;un. Go along, Luce! and learn yer
      lessons for to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reluctantly the daughter of the Royal Navy glided away. Her uncle&rsquo;s head
      followed her to the door, where she dallied to catch a last impression of
      the young stranger&rsquo;s lowering face, and darted through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Blaize laughed and chuckled. &ldquo;She an&rsquo;t so fond of her uncle as
      that, every day! Not that she an&rsquo;t a good nurse&mdash;the kindest little
      soul you&rsquo;d meet of a winter&rsquo;s walk! She&rsquo;ll read t&rsquo; ye, and make drinks,
      and sing, too, if ye likes it, and she won&rsquo;t be tired. A obstinate good
      &lsquo;un, she be! Bless her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The farmer may have designed, by these eulogies of his niece, to give his
      visitor time to recover his composure, and establish a common topic. His
      diversion only irritated and confused our shame-eaten youth. Richard&rsquo;s
      intention had been to come to the farmer&rsquo;s threshold: to summon the farmer
      thither, and in a loud and haughty tone then and there to take upon
      himself the whole burden of the charge against Tom Bakewell. He had
      strayed, during his passage to Belthorpe, somewhat back to his old nature;
      and his being compelled to enter the house of his enemy, sit in his chair,
      and endure an introduction to his family, was more than he bargained for.
      He commenced blinking hard in preparation for the horrible dose to which
      delay and the farmer&rsquo;s cordiality added inconceivable bitters. Farmer
      Blaize was quite at his ease; nowise in a hurry. He spoke of the weather
      and the harvest: of recent doings up at the Abbey: glanced over that
      year&rsquo;s cricketing; hoped that no future Feverel would lose a leg to the
      game. Richard saw and heard Arson in it all. He blinked harder as he
      neared the cup. In a moment of silence, he seized it with a gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Blaize! I have come to tell you that I am the person who set fire to
      your rick the other night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An odd consternation formed about the farmer&rsquo;s mouth. He changed his
      posture, and said, &ldquo;Ay? that&rsquo;s what ye&rsquo;re come to tell me sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Richard, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that be all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Richard reiterated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer again changed his posture. &ldquo;Then, my lad, ye&rsquo;ve come to tell me
      a lie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Blaize looked straight at the boy, undismayed by the dark flush of
      ire he had kindled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dare to call me a liar!&rdquo; cried Richard, starting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; the farmer renewed his first emphasis, and smacked his thigh
      thereto, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard held out his clenched fist. &ldquo;You have twice insulted me. You have
      struck me: you have dared to call me a liar. I would have apologized&mdash;I
      would have asked your pardon, to have got off that fellow in prison. Yes!
      I would have degraded myself that another man should not suffer for my
      deed&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite proper!&rdquo; interposed the farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you take this opportunity of insulting me afresh. You&rsquo;re a coward,
      sir! nobody but a coward would have insulted me in his own house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit ye down, sit ye down, young master,&rdquo; said the farmer, indicating the
      chair and cooling the outburst with his hand. &ldquo;Sit ye down. Don&rsquo;t ye be
      hasty. If ye hadn&rsquo;t been hasty t&rsquo;other day, we sh&rsquo;d a been friends yet.
      Sit ye down, sir. I sh&rsquo;d be sorry to reckon you out a liar, Mr. Feverel,
      or anybody o&rsquo; your name. I respects yer father though we&rsquo;re opp&rsquo;site
      politics. I&rsquo;m willin&rsquo; to think well o&rsquo; you. What I say is, that as you say
      an&rsquo;t the trewth. Mind! I don&rsquo;t like you none the worse for&rsquo;t. But it an&rsquo;t
      what is. That&rsquo;s all! You knows it as well&rsquo;s I!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard, disdaining to show signs of being pacified, angrily reseated
      himself. The farmer spoke sense, and the boy, after his late interview
      with Austin, had become capable of perceiving vaguely that a towering
      passion is hardly the justification for a wrong course of conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; continued the farmer, not unkindly, &ldquo;what else have you to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was the same bitter cup he had already once drained brimming at
      Richard&rsquo;s lips again! Alas, poor human nature! that empties to the dregs a
      dozen of these evil drinks, to evade the single one which Destiny, less
      cruel, had insisted upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy blinked and tossed it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to say that I regretted the revenge I had taken on you for your
      striking me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Blaize nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now ye&rsquo;ve done, young gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still another cupful!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be very much obliged,&rdquo; Richard formally began, but his stomach
      was turned; he could but sip and sip, and gather a distaste which
      threatened to make the penitential act impossible. &ldquo;Very much obliged,&rdquo; he
      repeated: &ldquo;much obliged, if you would be so kind,&rdquo; and it struck him that
      had he spoken this at first he would have given it a wording more
      persuasive with the farmer and more worthy of his own pride: more honest,
      in fact: for a sense of the dishonesty of what he was saying caused him to
      cringe and simulate humility to deceive the farmer, and the more he said
      the less he felt his words, and, feeling them less, he inflated them more.
      &ldquo;So kind,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;so kind&rdquo; (fancy a Feverel asking this big brute
      to be so kind!) &ldquo;as to do me the favour&rdquo; (me the favour!) &ldquo;to exert
      yourself&rdquo; (it&rsquo;s all to please Austin) &ldquo;to endeavour to&mdash;hem! to&rdquo;
       (there&rsquo;s no saying it!)&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The cup was full as ever. Richard dashed at it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I came to ask is, whether you would have the kindness to try what
      you could do&rdquo; (what an infamous shame to have to beg like this!) &ldquo;do to
      save&mdash;do to ensure&mdash;whether you would have the kindness&rdquo; It
      seemed out of all human power to gulp it down. The draught grew more and
      more abhorrent. To proclaim one&rsquo;s iniquity, to apologize for one&rsquo;s
      wrongdoing; thus much could be done; but to beg a favour of the offended
      party&mdash;that was beyond the self-abasement any Feverel could consent
      to. Pride, however, whose inevitable battle is against itself, drew aside
      the curtains of poor Tom&rsquo;s prison, crying a second time, &ldquo;Behold your
      Benefactor!&rdquo; and, with the words burning in his ears, Richard swallowed
      the dose:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I want you, Mr. Blaize,&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t mind&mdash;will
      you help me to get this man Bakewell off his punishment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To do Farmer Blaize justice, he waited very patiently for the boy, though
      he could not quite see why he did not take the gate at the first offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said he, when he heard and had pondered on the request. &ldquo;Hum! ha!
      we&rsquo;ll see about it t&rsquo;morrow. But if he&rsquo;s innocent, you know, we shan&rsquo;t
      mak&rsquo;n guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was I did it!&rdquo; Richard declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer&rsquo;s half-amused expression sharpened a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, young gentleman! and you&rsquo;re sorry for the night&rsquo;s work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall see that you are paid the full extent of your losses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank&rsquo;ee,&rdquo; said the farmer drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, if this poor man is released to-morrow, I don&rsquo;t care what the amount
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Blaize deflected his head twice in silence. &ldquo;Bribery,&rdquo; one motion
      expressed: &ldquo;Corruption,&rdquo; the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, leaning forward, and fixing his elbows on his knees, while
      he counted the case at his fingers&rsquo; ends, &ldquo;excuse the liberty, but wishin&rsquo; 
      to know where this &lsquo;ere money&rsquo;s to come from, I sh&rsquo;d like jest t&rsquo;ask if so
      be Sir Austin know o&rsquo; this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father knows nothing of it,&rdquo; replied Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer flung back in his chair. &ldquo;Lie number Two,&rdquo; said his shoulders,
      soured by the British aversion to being plotted at, and not dealt with
      openly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ye&rsquo;ve the money ready, young gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall ask my father for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he&rsquo;ll hand&rsquo;t out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly he will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard had not the slightest intention of ever letting his father into
      his counsels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good three hundred pounds, ye know?&rdquo; the farmer suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      No consideration of the extent of damages, and the size of the sum,
      affected young Richard, who said boldly, &ldquo;He will not object when I tell
      him I want that sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was natural Farmer Blaize should be a trifle suspicious that a youth&rsquo;s
      guarantee would hardly be given for his father&rsquo;s readiness to disburse
      such a thumping bill, unless he had previously received his father&rsquo;s
      sanction and authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;why not &lsquo;a told him before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The farmer threw an objectionable shrewdness into his query, that caused
      Richard to compress his mouth and glance high.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Blaize was positive &lsquo;twas a lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! Ye still hold to&rsquo;t you fired the rick?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The blame is mine!&rdquo; quoth Richard, with the loftiness of a patriot of old
      Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na, na!&rdquo; the straightforward Briton put him aside. &ldquo;Ye did&rsquo;t, or ye
      didn&rsquo;t do&rsquo;t. Did ye do&rsquo;t, or no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thrust in a corner, Richard said, &ldquo;I did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Blaize reached his hand to the bell. It was answered in an instant
      by little Lucy, who received orders to fetch in a dependent at Belthorpe
      going by the name of the Bantam, and made her exit as she had entered,
      with her eyes on the young stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;these be my principles. I&rsquo;m a plain man, Mr.
      Feverel. Above board with me, and you&rsquo;ll find me handsome. Try to
      circumvent me, and I&rsquo;m a ugly customer. I&rsquo;ll show you I&rsquo;ve no animosity.
      Your father pays&mdash;you apologize. That&rsquo;s enough for me! Let Tom
      Bakewell fight&rsquo;t out with the Law, and I&rsquo;ll look on. The Law wasn&rsquo;t on the
      spot, I suppose? so the Law ain&rsquo;t much witness. But I am. Leastwise the
      Bantam is. I tell you, young gentleman, the Bantam saw&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s no moral
      use whatever your denyin&rsquo; that ev&rsquo;dence. And where&rsquo;s the good, sir, I ask?
      What comes of &lsquo;t? Whether it be you, or whether it be Tom Bakewell&mdash;ain&rsquo;t
      all one? If I holds back, ain&rsquo;t it sim&rsquo;lar? It&rsquo;s the trewth I want! And
      here&rsquo;t comes,&rdquo; added the farmer, as Miss Lucy ushered in the Bantam, who
      presented a curious figure for that rare divinity to enliven.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      In build of body, gait and stature, Giles Jinkson, the Bantam, was a
      tolerably fair representative of the Punic elephant, whose part, with
      diverse anticipations, the generals of the Blaize and Feverel forces, from
      opposing ranks, expected him to play. Giles, surnamed the Bantam, on
      account of some forgotten sally of his youth or infancy, moved and looked
      elephantine. It sufficed that Giles was well fed to assure that Giles was
      faithful&mdash;if uncorrupted. The farm which supplied to him ungrudging
      provender had all his vast capacity for work in willing exercise: the
      farmer who held the farm his instinct reverenced as the fountain source of
      beef and bacon, to say nothing of beer, which was plentiful at Belthorpe,
      and good. This Farmer Blaize well knew, and he reckoned consequently that
      here was an animal always to be relied on&mdash;a sort of human
      composition out of dog, horse, and bull, a cut above each of these
      quadrupeds in usefulness, and costing proportionately more, but on the
      whole worth the money, and therefore invaluable, as everything worth its
      money must be to a wise man. When the stealing of grain had been made
      known at Belthorpe, the Bantam, a fellow-thresher with Tom Bakewell, had
      shared with him the shadow of the guilt. Farmer Blaize, if he hesitated
      which to suspect, did not debate a second as to which he would discard;
      and, when the Bantam said he had seen Tom secreting pilkins in a sack,
      Farmer Blaize chose to believe him, and off went poor Tom, told to rejoice
      in the clemency that spared his appearance at Sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bantam&rsquo;s small sleepy orbits saw many things, and just at the right
      moment, it seemed. He was certainly the first to give the clue at
      Belthorpe on the night of the conflagration, and he may, therefore, have
      seen poor Tom retreating stealthily from the scene, as he averred he did.
      Lobourne had its say on the subject. Rustic Lobourne hinted broadly at a
      young woman in the case, and, moreover, told a tale of how these
      fellow-threshers had, in noble rivalry, one day turned upon each other to
      see which of the two threshed the best; whereof the Bantam still bore
      marks, and malice, it was said. However, there he stood, and tugged his
      forelocks to the company, and if Truth really had concealed herself in him
      she must have been hard set to find her unlikeliest hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the farmer, marshalling forth his elephant with the confidence
      of one who delivers his ace of trumps, &ldquo;tell this young gentleman what ye
      saw on the night of the fire, Bantam!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bantam jerked a bit of a bow to his patron, and then swung round,
      fully obscuring him from Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard fixed his eyes on the floor, while the Bantam in rudest Doric
      commenced his narrative. Knowing what was to come, and thoroughly nerved
      to confute the main incident, Richard barely listened to his barbarous
      locution: but when the recital arrived at the point where the Bantam
      affirmed he had seen &ldquo;T&rsquo;m Baak&rsquo;ll wi&rsquo;s owen hoies,&rdquo; Richard faced him, and
      was amazed to find himself being mutely addressed by a series of intensely
      significant grimaces, signs, and winks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? Why are you making those faces at me?&rdquo; cried the boy
      indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Blaize leaned round the Bantam to have a look at him, and beheld
      the stolidest mask ever given to man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bain&rsquo;t makin&rsquo; no faces at nobody,&rdquo; growled the sulky elephant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer commanded him to face about and finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A see T&rsquo;m Baak&rsquo;ll,&rdquo; the Bantam recommenced, and again the contortions of
      a horrible wink were directed at Richard. The boy might well believe this
      churl was lying, and he did, and was emboldened to exclaim&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never saw Tom Bakewell set fire to that rick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bantam swore to it, grimacing an accompaniment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;I put the lucifers there myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The suborned elephant was staggered. He meant to telegraph to the young
      gentleman that he was loyal and true to certain gold pieces that had been
      given him, and that in the right place and at the right time he should
      prove so. Why was he thus suspected? Why was he not understood?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thowt I see &lsquo;un, then,&rdquo; muttered the Bantam, trying a middle course.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brought down on him the farmer, who roared, &ldquo;Thought! Ye thought!
      What d&rsquo;ye mean? Speak out, and don&rsquo;t be thinkin&rsquo;. Thought? What the
      devil&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could he see who it was on a pitch-dark night?&rdquo; Richard put in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought!&rdquo; the farmer bellowed louder. &ldquo;Thought&mdash;Devil take ye, when
      ye took ye oath on&rsquo;t. Hulloa! What are ye screwin&rsquo; yer eye at Mr. Feverel
      for?&mdash;I say, young gentleman, have you spoke to this chap before
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; replied Richard. &ldquo;I have not seen him before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Blaize grasped the two arms of the chair he sat on, and glared his
      doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he to the Bantam, &ldquo;speak out, and ha&rsquo; done wi&rsquo;t. Say what ye
      saw, and none o&rsquo; yer thoughts. Damn yer thoughts! Ye saw Tom Bakewell fire
      that there rick!&rdquo; The farmer pointed at some musk-pots in the window.
      &ldquo;What business ha&rsquo; you to be a-thinkin&rsquo;? You&rsquo;re a witness? Thinkin&rsquo; an&rsquo;t
      ev&rsquo;dence. What&rsquo;ll ye say to morrow before magistrate! Mind! what you says
      today, you&rsquo;ll stick by to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus adjured, the Bantam hitched his breech. What on earth the young
      gentleman meant he was at a loss to speculate. He could not believe that
      the young gentleman wanted to be transported, but if he had been paid to
      help that, why, he would. And considering that this day&rsquo;s evidence rather
      bound him down to the morrow&rsquo;s, he determined, after much ploughing and
      harrowing through obstinate shocks of hair, to be not altogether positive
      as to the person. It is possible that he became thereby more a mansion of
      truth than he previously had been; for the night, as he said, was so dark
      that you could not see your hand before your face; and though, as he
      expressed it, you might be mortal sure of a man, you could not identify
      him upon oath, and the party he had taken for Tom Bakewell, and could have
      sworn to, might have been the young gentleman present, especially as he
      was ready to swear it upon oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      So ended the Bantam.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had he ceased, than Farmer Blaize jumped up from his chair, and
      made a fine effort to lift him out of the room from the point of his toe.
      He failed, and sank back groaning with the pain of the exertion and
      disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re liars, every one!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Liars, perj&rsquo;rers, bribers, and
      c&rsquo;rrupters!&mdash;Stop!&rdquo; to the Bantam, who was slinking away. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
      done for yerself already! You swore to it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A din&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said the Bantam, doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You swore to&rsquo;t!&rdquo; the farmer vociferated afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bantam played a tune upon the handle of the door, and still affirmed
      that he did not; a double contradiction at which the farmer absolutely
      raged in his chair, and was hoarse, as he called out a third time that the
      Bantam had sworn to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noa!&rdquo; said the Bantam, ducking his poll. &ldquo;Noa!&rdquo; he repeated in a lower
      note; and then, while a sombre grin betokening idiotic enjoyment of his
      profound casuistical quibble worked at his jaw:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not up&rsquo;n o-ath!&rdquo; he added, with a twitch of the shoulder and an angular
      jerk of the elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Blaize looked vacantly at Richard, as if to ask him what he thought
      of England&rsquo;s peasantry after the sample they had there. Richard would have
      preferred not to laugh, but his dignity gave way to his sense of the
      ludicrous, and he let fly a shout. The farmer was in no laughing mood. He
      turned a wide eye back to the door, &ldquo;Lucky for&rsquo;m,&rdquo; he exclaimed, seeing
      the Bantam had vanished, for his fingers itched to break that stubborn
      head. He grew very puffy, and addressed Richard solemnly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, look ye here, Mr. Feverel! You&rsquo;ve been a-tampering with my witness.
      It&rsquo;s no use denyin&rsquo;! I say y&rsquo; &lsquo;ave, sir! You, or some of ye. I don&rsquo;t care
      about no Feverel! My witness there has been bribed. The Bantam&rsquo;s been
      bribed,&rdquo; and he shivered his pipe with an energetic thump on the table&mdash;&ldquo;bribed!
      I knows it! I could swear to&rsquo;t!&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon oath?&rdquo; Richard inquired, with a grave face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, upon oath!&rdquo; said the farmer, not observing the impertinence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d take my Bible oath on&rsquo;t! He&rsquo;s been corrupted, my principal witness!
      Oh! it&rsquo;s dam cunnin&rsquo;, but it won&rsquo;t do the trick. I&rsquo;ll transport Tom
      Bakewell, sure as a gun. He shall travel, that man shall. Sorry for you,
      Mr. Feverel&mdash;sorry you haven&rsquo;t seen how to treat me proper&mdash;you,
      or yours. Money won&rsquo;t do everything&mdash;no! it won&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;ll c&rsquo;rrupt a
      witness, but it won&rsquo;t clear a felon. I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; &lsquo;soused you, sir! You&rsquo;re a
      boy and&rsquo;ll learn better. I asked no more than payment and apology; and
      that I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; taken content&mdash;always provided my witnesses weren&rsquo;t
      tampered with. Now you must stand yer luck, all o&rsquo; ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard stood up and replied, &ldquo;Very well, Mr. Blaize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if,&rdquo; continued the farmer, &ldquo;Tom Bakewell don&rsquo;t drag you into&rsquo;t after
      &lsquo;m, why, you&rsquo;re safe, as I hope ye&rsquo;ll be, sincere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not in consideration of my own safety that I sought this interview
      with you,&rdquo; said Richard, head erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grant ye that,&rdquo; the farmer responded. &ldquo;Grant ye that! Yer bold enough,
      young gentleman&mdash;comes of the blood that should be! If y&rsquo; had only
      ha&rsquo; spoke trewth!&mdash;I believe yer father&mdash;believe every word he
      said. I do wish I could ha&rsquo; said as much for Sir Austin&rsquo;s son and heir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Richard, with an astonishment hardly to be feigned, &ldquo;you
      have seen my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Farmer Blaize had now such a scent for lies that he could detect them
      where they did not exist, and mumbled gruffly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, we knows all about that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy&rsquo;s perplexity saved him from being irritated. Who could have told
      his father? An old fear of his father came upon him, and a touch of an old
      inclination to revolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father knows of this?&rdquo; said he, very loudly, and staring, as he spoke,
      right through the farmer. &ldquo;Who has played me false? Who would betray me to
      him? It was Austin! No one knew it but Austin. Yes, and it was Austin who
      persuaded me to come here and submit to these indignities. Why couldn&rsquo;t he
      be open with me? I shall never trust him again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not you with me, young gentleman?&rdquo; said the farmer. &ldquo;I sh&rsquo;d trust
      you if ye had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard did not see the analogy. He bowed stiffly and bade him good
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Blaize pulled the bell. &ldquo;Company the young gentleman out, Lucy,&rdquo; he
      waved to the little damsel in the doorway. &ldquo;Do the honours. And, Mr.
      Richard, ye might ha&rsquo; made a friend o&rsquo; me, sir, and it&rsquo;s not too late so
      to do. I&rsquo;m not cruel, but I hate lies. I whipped my boy Tom, bigger than
      you, for not bein&rsquo; above board, only yesterday,&mdash;ay! made &lsquo;un stand
      within swing o&rsquo; this chair, and take&rsquo;s measure. Now, if ye&rsquo;ll come down to
      me, and speak trewth before the trial&mdash;if it&rsquo;s only five minutes
      before&rsquo;t; or if Sir Austin, who&rsquo;s a gentleman, &lsquo;ll say there&rsquo;s been no
      tamperin&rsquo; with any o&rsquo; my witnesses, his word for&rsquo;t&mdash;well and good!
      I&rsquo;ll do my best to help off Tom Bakewell. And I&rsquo;m glad, young gentleman,
      you&rsquo;ve got a conscience about a poor man, though he&rsquo;s a villain. Good
      afternoon, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard marched hastily out of the room, and through the garden, never so
      much as deigning a glance at his wistful little guide, who hung at the
      garden gate to watch him up the lane, wondering a world of fancies about
      the handsome proud boy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      To have determined upon an act something akin to heroism in its way, and
      to have fulfilled it by lying heartily, and so subverting the whole
      structure built by good resolution, seems a sad downfall if we forget what
      human nature, in its green weedy spring, is composed of. Young Richard had
      quitted his cousin Austin fully resolved to do his penance and drink the
      bitter cup; and he had drunk it; drained many cups to the dregs; and it
      was to no purpose. Still they floated before him, brimmed, trebly bitter.
      Away from Austin&rsquo;s influence, he was almost the same boy who had slipped
      the guinea into Tom Bakewell&rsquo;s hand, and the lucifers into Farmer Blaize&rsquo;s
      rick. For good seed is long ripening; a good boy is not made in a minute.
      Enough that the seed was in him. He chafed on his road to Raynham at the
      scene he had just endured, and the figure of Belthorpe&rsquo;s fat tenant burnt
      like hot copper on the tablet of his brain, insufferably condescending,
      and, what was worse, in the right. Richard, obscured as his mind&rsquo;s eye was
      by wounded pride, saw that clearly, and hated his enemy for it the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavy Benson&rsquo;s tongue was knelling dinner as Richard arrived at the Abbey.
      He hurried up to his room to dress. Accident, or design, had laid the book
      of Sir Austin&rsquo;s aphorisms open on the dressing-table. Hastily combing his
      hair, Richard glanced down and read&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;The Dog returneth to his vomit: the Liar must eat his Lie.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Underneath was interjected in pencil: &ldquo;The Devil&rsquo;s mouthful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Richard ran downstairs feeling that his father had struck him in the
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin marked the scarlet stain on his son&rsquo;s cheekbones. He sought the
      youth&rsquo;s eye, but Richard would not look, and sat conning his plate, an
      abject copy of Adrian&rsquo;s succulent air at that employment. How could he
      pretend to the relish of an epicure when he was painfully endeavouring to
      masticate The Devil&rsquo;s mouthful?
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavy Benson sat upon the wretched dinner. Hippias usually the silent
      member, as if awakened by the unnatural stillness, became sprightly, like
      the goatsucker owl at night and spoke much of his book, his digestion, and
      his dreams, and was spared both by Algernon and Adrian. One inconsequent
      dream he related, about fancying himself quite young and rich, and finding
      himself suddenly in a field cropping razors around him, when, just as he
      had, by steps dainty as those of a French dancing-master, reached the
      middle, he to his dismay beheld a path clear of the blood, thirsty
      steel-crop, which he might have taken at first had he looked narrowly; and
      there he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippias&rsquo;s brethren regarded him with eyes that plainly said they wished he
      had remained there. Sir Austin, however, drew forth his note-book, and
      jotted down a reflection. A composer of aphorisms can pluck blossoms even
      from a razor-prop. Was not Hippias&rsquo;s dream the very counterpart of
      Richard&rsquo;s position? He, had he looked narrowly, might have taken the clear
      path: he, too, had been making dainty steps till he was surrounded by the
      grinning blades. And from that text Sir Austin preached to his son when
      they were alone. Little Clare was still too unwell to be permitted to
      attend the dessert, and father and son were soon closeted together.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a strange meeting. They seemed to have been separated so long. The
      father took his son&rsquo;s hand; they sat without a word passing between them.
      Silence said most. The boy did not understand his father: his father
      frequently thwarted him: at times he thought his father foolish: but that
      paternal pressure of his hand was eloquent to him of how warmly he was
      beloved. He tried once or twice to steal his hand away, conscious it was
      melting him. The spirit of his pride, and old rebellion, whispered him to
      be hard, unbending, resolute. Hard he had entered his father&rsquo;s study: hard
      he had met his father&rsquo;s eyes. He could not meet them now. His father sat
      beside him gently; with a manner that was almost meekness, so he loved
      this boy. The poor gentleman&rsquo;s lips moved. He was praying internally to
      God for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees an emotion awoke in the boy&rsquo;s bosom. Love is that blessed wand
      which wins the waters from the hardness of the heart. Richard fought
      against it, for the dignity of old rebellion. The tears would come; hot
      and struggling over the dams of pride. Shamefully fast they began to fall.
      He could no longer conceal them, or check the sobs. Sir Austin drew him
      nearer and nearer, till the beloved head was on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour afterwards, Adrian Harley, Austin Wentworth, and Algernon Feverel
      were summoned to the baronet&rsquo;s study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian came last. There was a style of affable omnipotence about the wise
      youth as he slung himself into a chair, and made an arch of the points of
      his fingers, through which to gaze on his blundering kinsmen. Careless as
      one may be whose sagacity has foreseen, and whose benevolent efforts have
      forestalled, the point of danger at the threshold, Adrian crossed his
      legs, and only intruded on their introductory remarks so far as to hum
      half audibly at intervals,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Ripton and Richard were two pretty men,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      in parody of the old ballad. Young Richard&rsquo;s red eyes, and the baronet&rsquo;s
      ruffled demeanour, told him that an explanation had taken place, and a
      reconciliation. That was well. The baronet would now pay cheerfully.
      Adrian summed and considered these matters, and barely listened when the
      baronet called attention to what he had to say: which was elaborately to
      inform all present, what all present very well knew, that a rick had been
      fired, that his son was implicated as an accessory to the fact, that the
      perpetrator was now imprisoned, and that Richard&rsquo;s family were, as it
      seemed to him, bound in honour to do their utmost to effect the man&rsquo;s
      release.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the baronet stated that he had himself been down to Belthorpe, his
      son likewise: and that he had found every disposition in Blaize to meet
      his wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lamp which ultimately was sure to be lifted up to illumine the acts of
      this secretive race began slowly to dispread its rays; and, as statement
      followed statement, they saw that all had known of the business: that all
      had been down to Belthorpe: all save the wise youth Adrian, who, with due
      deference and a sarcastic shrug, objected to the proceeding, as putting
      them in the hands of the man Blaize. His wisdom shone forth in an oration
      so persuasive and aphoristic that had it not been based on a plea against
      honour, it would have made Sir Austin waver. But its basis was expediency,
      and the baronet had a better aphorism of his own to confute him with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Expediency is man&rsquo;s wisdom, Adrian Harley. Doing right is God&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian curbed his desire to ask Sir Austin whether an attempt to
      counteract the just working of the law was doing right. The direct
      application of an aphorism was unpopular at Raynham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to understand then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that Blaize consents not to press the
      prosecution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Algernon remarked. &ldquo;Confound him! he&rsquo;ll have his
      money, and what does he want besides?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These agricultural gentlemen are delicate customers to deal with.
      However, if he really consents&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have his promise,&rdquo; said the baronet, fondling his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Richard looked up to his father, as if he wished to speak. He said
      nothing, and Sir Austin took it as a mute reply to his caresses; and
      caressed him the more. Adrian perceived a reserve in the boy&rsquo;s manner, and
      as he was not quite satisfied that his chief should suppose him to have
      been the only idle, and not the most acute and vigilant member of the
      family, he commenced a cross-examination of him by asking who had last
      spoken with the tenant of Belthorpe?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I saw him last,&rdquo; murmured Richard, and relinquished his father&rsquo;s
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian fastened on his prey. &ldquo;And left him with a distinct and
      satisfactory assurance of his amicable intentions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not?&rdquo; the Feverels joined in astounded chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard sidled away from his father, and repeated a shamefaced &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he hostile?&rdquo; inquired Adrian, smoothing his palms, and smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the boy confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was quite another view of their position. Adrian, generally patient
      of results, triumphed strongly at having evoked it, and turned upon Austin
      Wentworth, reproving him for inducing the boy to go down to Belthorpe.
      Austin looked grieved. He feared that Richard had faded in his good
      resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it his duty to go,&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was!&rdquo; said the baronet, emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you see what comes of it, sir,&rdquo; Adrian struck in. &ldquo;These agricultural
      gentlemen, I repeat, are delicate customers to deal with. For my part I
      would prefer being in the hands of a policeman. We are decidedly collared
      by Blaize. What were his words, Ricky? Give it in his own Doric.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he would transport Tom Bakewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian smoothed his palms, and smiled again. Then they could afford to
      defy Mr. Blaize, he informed them significantly, and made once more a
      mysterious allusion to the Punic elephant, bidding his relatives be at
      peace. They were attaching, in his opinion, too much importance to
      Richard&rsquo;s complicity. The man was a fool, and a very extraordinary
      arsonite, to have an accomplice at all. It was a thing unknown in the
      annals of rick-burning. But one would be severer than law itself to say
      that a boy of fourteen had instigated to crime a full-grown man. At that
      rate the boy was &lsquo;father of the man&rsquo; with a vengeance, and one might hear
      next that &lsquo;the baby was father of the boy.&rsquo; They would find common sense a
      more benevolent ruler than poetical metaphysics.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had done, Austin, with his customary directness, asked him what he
      meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess, Adrian,&rdquo; said the baronet, hearing him expostulate with
      Austin&rsquo;s stupidity, &ldquo;I for one am at a loss. I have heard that this man,
      Bakewell, chooses voluntarily not to inculpate my son. Seldom have I heard
      anything that so gratified me. It is a view of innate nobleness in the
      rustic&rsquo;s character which many a gentleman might take example from. We are
      bound to do our utmost for the man.&rdquo; And, saying that he should pay a
      second visit to Belthorpe, to inquire into the reasons for the farmer&rsquo;s
      sudden exposition of vindictiveness, Sir Austin rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he left the room, Algernon asked Richard if the farmer had
      vouchsafed any reasons, and the boy then spoke of the tampering with the
      witnesses, and the Bantam&rsquo;s &ldquo;Not upon oath!&rdquo; which caused Adrian to choke
      with laughter. Even the baronet smiled at so cunning a distinction as that
      involved in swearing a thing, and not swearing it upon oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How little,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;does one yeoman know another! To elevate a
      distinction into a difference is the natural action of their minds. I will
      point that out to Blaize. He shall see that the idea is native born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard saw his father go forth. Adrian, too, was ill at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This trotting down to Belthorpe spoils all,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The affair would
      pass over to-morrow&mdash;Blaize has no witnesses. The old rascal is only
      standing out for more money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Richard corrected him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that. I&rsquo;m sure he
      believes his witnesses have been tampered with, as he calls it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if they have, boy?&rdquo; Adrian put it boldly. &ldquo;The ground is cut from
      under his feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blaize told me that if my father would give his word there had been
      nothing of the sort, he would take it. My father will give his word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Adrian, &ldquo;you had better stop him from going down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Austin looked at Adrian keenly, and questioned him whether he thought the
      farmer was justified in his suspicions. The wise youth was not to be
      entrapped. He had only been given to understand that the witnesses were
      tolerably unstable, and, like the Bantam, ready to swear lustily, but not
      upon the Book. How given to understand, he chose not to explain, but he
      reiterated that the chief should not be allowed to go down to Belthorpe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin was in the lane leading to the farm when he heard steps of some
      one running behind him. It was dark, and he shook off the hand that laid
      hold of his cloak, roughly, not recognizing his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s I, sir,&rdquo; said Richard panting. &ldquo;Pardon me. You mustn&rsquo;t go in there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said the baronet, putting his arm about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; continued the boy. &ldquo;I will tell you all to-night. I must see
      the farmer myself. It was my fault, sir. I-I lied to him&mdash;the Liar
      must eat his Lie. Oh, forgive me for disgracing you, sir. I did it&mdash;I
      hope I did it to save Tom Bakewell. Let me go in alone, and speak the
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, and I will wait for you here,&rdquo; said his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind that bowed the old elms, and shivered the dead leaves in the air,
      had a voice and a meaning for the baronet during that half-hour&rsquo;s lonely
      pacing up and down under the darkness, awaiting his boy&rsquo;s return. The
      solemn gladness of his heart gave nature a tongue. Through the desolation
      flying overhead&mdash;the wailing of the Mother of Plenty across the
      bare-swept land&mdash;he caught intelligible signs of the beneficent order
      of the universe, from a heart newly confirmed in its grasp of the
      principle of human goodness, as manifested in the dear child who had just
      left him; confirmed in its belief in the ultimate victory of good within
      us, without which nature has neither music nor meaning, and is rock,
      stone, tree, and nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dark, the dead leaves beating on his face, he had a word for his
      note-book: &ldquo;There is for the mind but one grasp of happiness: from that
      uppermost pinnacle of wisdom, whence we see that this world is well
      designed.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of all the chief actors in the Bakewell Comedy, Master Ripton Thompson
      awaited the fearful morning which was to decide Tom&rsquo;s fate, in dolefullest
      mood, and suffered the gravest mental terrors. Adrian, on parting with
      him, had taken casual occasion to speak of the position of the criminal in
      modern Europe, assuring him that International Treaty now did what
      Universal Empire had aforetime done, and that among Atlantic barbarians
      now, as among the Scythians of old, an offender would find precarious
      refuge and an emissary haunting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the paternal home, under the roofs of Law, and removed from the
      influence of his conscienceless young chief, the staggering nature of the
      act he had put his hand to, its awful felonious aspect, overwhelmed
      Ripton. He saw it now for the first time. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s next to murder!&rdquo; he
      cried out to his amazed soul, and wandered about the house with a prickly
      skin. Thoughts of America, and commencing life afresh as an innocent
      gentleman, had crossed his disordered brain. He wrote to his friend
      Richard, proposing to collect disposable funds, and embark, in case of
      Tom&rsquo;s breaking his word, or of accidental discovery. He dared not confide
      the secret to his family, as his leader had sternly enjoined him to avoid
      any weakness of that kind; and, being by nature honest and communicative,
      the restriction was painful, and melancholy fell upon the boy. Mama
      Thompson attributed it to love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daughters of parchment rallied him concerning Miss Clare Forey. His
      hourly letters to Raynham, and silence as to everything and everybody
      there, his nervousness, and unwonted propensity to sudden inflammation of
      the cheeks, were set down for sure signs of the passion. Miss Letitia
      Thompson, the pretty and least parchmenty one, destined by her Papa for
      the heir of Raynham, and perfectly aware of her brilliant future, up to
      which she had, since Ripton&rsquo;s departure, dressed and grimaced, and studied
      cadences (the latter with such success, though not yet fifteen, that she
      languished to her maid, and melted the small factotum footman)&mdash;Miss
      Letty, whose insatiable thirst for intimations about the young heir Ripton
      could not satisfy, tormented him daily in revenge, and once, quite
      unconsciously, gave the lad a fearful turn; for after dinner, when Mr.
      Thompson read the paper by the fire, preparatory to sleeping at his
      accustomed post, and Mama Thompson and her submissive female brood sat
      tasking the swift intricacies of the needle, and emulating them with the
      tongue, Miss Letty stole behind Ripton&rsquo;s chair, and introduced between him
      and his book the Latin initial letter, large and illuminated, of the theme
      she supposed to be absorbing him, as it did herself. The unexpected vision
      of this accusing Captain of the Alphabet, this resplendent and haunting A.
      fronting him bodily, threw Ripton straight back in his chair, while Guilt,
      with her ancient indecision what colours to assume on detection, flew from
      red to white, from white to red, across his fallen chaps. Letty laughed
      triumphantly. Amor, the word she had in mind, certainly has a connection
      with Arson.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the delivery of a letter into Master Ripton&rsquo;s hands, furnished her
      with other and likelier appearances to study. For scarce had Ripton
      plunged his head into the missive than he gave way to violent transports,
      such as the healthy-minded little damsel, for all her languishing
      cadences, deemed she really could express were a downright declaration to
      be made to her. The boy did not stop at table. Quickly recollecting the
      presence of his family, he rushed to his own room. And now the girl&rsquo;s
      ingenuity was taxed to gain possession of that letter. She succeeded, of
      course, she being a huntress with few scruples and the game unguarded.
      With the eyes of amazement she read this foreign matter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Ripton,&mdash;If Tom had been committed I would have shot old
      Blaize. Do you know my father was behind us that night when Clare saw the
      ghost and heard all we said before the fire burst out. It is no use trying
      to conceal anything from him. Well as you are in an awful state I will
      tell you all about it. After you left Ripton I had a conversation with
      Austin and he persuaded me to go down to old Blaize and ask him to help
      off Tom. I went for I would have done anything for Tom after what he said
      to Austin and I defied the old churl to do his worst. Then he said if my
      father paid the money and nobody had tampered with his witnesses he would
      not mind if Tom did get off and he had his chief witness in called the
      Bantam very like his master I think and the Bantam began winking at me
      tremendously as you say, and said he had sworn he saw Tom Bakewell but not
      upon oath. He meant not on the Bible. He could swear to it but not on the
      Bible. I burst out laughing and you should have seen the rage old Blaize
      was in. It was splendid fun. Then we had a consultation at home Austin
      Rady my father Uncle Algernon who has come down to us again and your
      friend in prosperity and adversity R.D.F. My father said he would go down
      to old Blaize and give him the word of a gentleman we had not tampered
      with his witnesses and when he was gone we were all talking and Rady says
      he must not see the farmer. I am as certain as I live that it was Rady
      bribed the Bantam. Well I ran and caught up my father and told him not to
      go in to old Blaize but I would and eat my words and tell him the truth.
      He waited for me in the lane. Never mind what passed between me and old
      Blaize. He made me beg and pray of him not to press it against Tom and
      then to complete it he brought in a little girl a niece of his and says to
      me, she&rsquo;s your best friend after all and told me to thank her. A little
      girl twelve years of age. What business had she to mix herself up in my
      matters. Depend upon it Ripton, wherever there is mischief there are girls
      I think. She had the insolence to notice my face, and ask me not to be
      unhappy. I was polite of course but I would not look at her. Well the
      morning came and Tom was had up before Sir Miles Papworth. It was Sir
      Miles gout gave us the time or Tom would have been had up before we could
      do anything. Adrian did not want me to go but my father said I should
      accompany him and held my hand all the time. I shall be careful about
      getting into these scrapes again. When you have done anything honourable
      you do not mind but getting among policemen and magistrates makes you
      ashamed of yourself. Sir Miles was very attentive to my father and me and
      dead against Tom. We sat beside him and Tom was brought in, Sir Miles told
      my father that if there was one thing that showed a low villain it was
      rick-burning. What do you think of that. I looked him straight in the face
      and he said to me he was doing me a service in getting Tom committed and
      clearing the country of such fellows and Rady began laughing. I hate Rady.
      My father said his son was not in haste to inherit and have estates of his
      own to watch and Sir Miles laughed too. I thought we were discovered at
      first. Then they began the examination of Tom. The Tinker was the first
      witness and he proved that Tom had spoken against old Blaize and said
      something about burning his rick. I wished I had stood in the lane to
      Bursley with him alone. Our country lawyer we engaged for Tom
      cross-questioned him and then he said he was not ready to swear to the
      exact words that had passed between him and Tom. I should think not. Then
      came another who swore he had seen Tom lurking about the farmer&rsquo;s grounds
      that night. Then came the Bantam and I saw him look at Rady. I was
      tremendously excited and my father kept pressing my hand. Just fancy my
      being brought to feel that a word from that fellow would make me miserable
      for life and he must perjure himself to help me. That comes of giving way
      to passion. My father says when we do that we are calling in the devil as
      doctor. Well the Bantam was told to state what he had seen and the moment
      he began Rady who was close by me began to shake and he was laughing I
      knew though his face was as grave as Sir Miles. You never heard such a
      rigmarole but I could not laugh. He said he thought he was certain he had
      seen somebody by the rick and it was Tom Bakewell who was the only man he
      knew who had a grudge against Farmer Blaize and if the object had been a
      little bigger he would not mind swearing to Tom and would swear to him for
      he was dead certain it was Tom only what he saw looked smaller and it was
      pitch-dark at the time. He was asked what time it was he saw the person
      steal away from the rick and then he began to scratch his head and said
      supper-time. Then they asked what time he had supper and he said nine
      o&rsquo;clock by the clock and we proved that at nine o&rsquo;clock Tom was drinking
      in the ale-house with the Tinker at Bursley and Sir Miles swore and said
      he was afraid he could not commit Tom and when he heard that Tom looked up
      at me and I say he is a noble fellow and no one shall sneer at Tom while I
      live. Mind that. Well Sir Miles asked us to dine with him and Tom was safe
      and I am to have him and educate him if I like for my servant and I will.
      And I will give money to his mother and make her rich and he shall never
      repent he knew me. I say Rip. The Bantam must have seen me. It was when I
      went to stick in the lucifers. As we were all going home from Sir Miles&rsquo;s
      at night he has lots of red-faced daughters but I did not dance with them
      though they had music and were full of fun and I did not care to I was so
      delighted and almost let it out. When we left and rode home Rady said to
      my father the Bantam was not such a fool as he was thought and my father
      said one must be in a state of great personal exaltation to apply that
      epithet to any man and Rady shut his mouth and I gave my pony a clap of
      the heel for joy. I think my father suspects what Rady did and does not
      approve of it. And he need not have done it after all and might have
      spoilt it. I have been obliged to order him not to call me Ricky for he
      stops short at Rick so that everybody knows what he means. My dear Austin
      is going to South America. My pony is in capital condition. My father is
      the cleverest and best man in the world. Clare is a little better. I am
      quite happy. I hope we shall meet soon my dear Old Rip and we will not get
      into any more tremendous scrapes will we.&mdash;I remain,
    </p>

    <p>
      Poor little Letitia, after three perusals of this ingenuous epistle, where
      the laws of punctuation were so disregarded, resigned it to one of the
      pockets of her brother Ripton&rsquo;s best jacket, deeply smitten with the
      careless composer. And so ended the last act of the Bakewell Comedy, in
      which the curtain closes with Sir Austin&rsquo;s pointing out to his friends the
      beneficial action of the System in it from beginning to end.

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Laying of ghosts is a public duty, and, as the mystery of the apparition
      that had frightened little Clare was never solved on the stage of events
      at Raynham, where dread walked the Abbey, let us go behind the scenes a
      moment. Morally superstitious as the baronet was, the character of his
      mind was opposed to anything like spiritual agency in the affairs of men,
      and, when the matter was made clear to him, it shook off a weight of
      weakness and restored his mental balance; so that from this time he went
      about more like the man he had once been, grasping more thoroughly the
      great truth, that This World is well designed. Nay, he could laugh on
      hearing Adrian, in reminiscence of the ill luck of one of the family
      members at its first manifestation, call the uneasy spirit, Algernon&rsquo;s
      Leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doria was outraged. She maintained that her child had seen &mdash;&mdash;.
      Not to believe in it was almost to rob her of her personal property. After
      satisfactorily studying his old state of mind in her, Sir Austin, moved by
      pity, took her aside one day and showed her that her Ghost could write
      words in the flesh. It was a letter from the unhappy lady who had given
      Richard birth,&mdash;brief cold lines, simply telling him his house would
      be disturbed by her no more. Cold lines, but penned by what heart-broken
      abnegation, and underlying them with what anguish of soul! Like most who
      dealt with him, Lady Feverel thought her husband a man fatally stern and
      implacable, and she acted as silly creatures will act when they fancy they
      see a fate against them: she neither petitioned for her right nor claimed
      it: she tried to ease her heart&rsquo;s yearning by stealth, and, now she
      renounced all. Mrs. Doria, not wanting in the family tenderness and
      softness, shuddered at him for accepting the sacrifice so composedly: but
      he bade her to think how distracting to this boy would be the sight of
      such relations between mother and father. A few years, and as man he
      should know, and judge, and love her. &ldquo;Let this be her penance, not
      inflicted by me!&rdquo; Mrs. Doria bowed to the System for another, not opining
      when it would be her turn to bow for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further behind the scenes we observe Rizzio and Mary grown older, much
      disenchanted: she discrowned, dishevelled,&mdash;he with gouty fingers on
      a greasy guitar. The Diaper Sandoe of promise lends his pen for small
      hires. His fame has sunk; his bodily girth has sensibly increased. What he
      can do, and will do, is still his theme; meantime the juice of the juniper
      is in requisition, and it seems that those small hires cannot be performed
      without it. Returning from her wretched journey to her wretcheder home,
      the lady had to listen to a mild reproof from easy-going Diaper,&mdash;a
      reproof so mild that he couched it in blank verse: for, seldom writing
      metrically now, he took to talking it. With a fluent sympathetic tear, he
      explained to her that she was damaging her interests by these proceedings;
      nor did he shrink from undertaking to elucidate wherefore. Pluming a smile
      upon his succulent mouth, he told her that the poverty she lived in was
      utterly unbefitting her gentle nurture, and that he had reason to believe&mdash;could
      assure her&mdash;that an annuity was on the point of being granted her by
      her husband. And Diaper broke his bud of a smile into full flower as he
      delivered this information. She learnt that he had applied to her husband
      for money. It is hard to have one&rsquo;s prop of self-respect cut away just
      when we are suffering a martyr&rsquo;s agony at the stake. There was a five
      minutes&rsquo; tragic colloquy in the recesses behind the scenes,&mdash;totally
      tragic to Diaper, who had fondly hoped to bask in the warm sun of that
      annuity, and re-emerge from his state of grub. The lady then wrote the
      letter Sir Austin held open to his sister. The atmosphere behind the
      scenes is not wholesome, so, having laid the Ghost, we will return and
      face the curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      That infinitesimal dose of The World which Master Ripton Thompson had
      furnished to the System with such instantaneous and surprising effect was
      considered by Sir Austin to have worked well, and to be for the time quite
      sufficient, so that Ripton did not receive a second invitation to Raynham,
      and Richard had no special intimate of his own age to rub his excessive
      vitality against, and wanted none. His hands were full enough with Tom
      Bakewell. Moreover, his father and he were heart in heart. The boy&rsquo;s mind
      was opening, and turned to his father affectionately reverent. At this
      period, when the young savage grows into higher influences, the faculty of
      worship is foremost in him. At this period Jesuits will stamp the future
      of their chargeling flocks; and all who bring up youth by a System, and
      watch it, know that it is the malleable moment. Boys possessing any mental
      or moral force to give them a tendency, then predestinate their careers;
      or, if under supervision, take the impress that is given them: not often
      to cast it off, and seldom to cast it off altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Sir Austin&rsquo;s Note-book was written: &ldquo;Between Simple Boyhood and
      Adolescence&mdash;The Blossoming Season&mdash;on the threshold of Puberty,
      there is one Unselfish Hour&mdash;say, Spiritual Seed-time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took care that good seed should be planted in Richard, and that the
      most fruitful seed for a youth, namely, Example, should be of a kind to
      germinate in him the love of every form of nobleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only striving to make my son a Christian,&rdquo; he said, answering them
      who persisted in expostulating with the System. And to these instructions
      he gave an aim: &ldquo;First be virtuous,&rdquo; he told his son, &ldquo;and then serve your
      country with heart and soul.&rdquo; The youth was instructed to cherish an
      ambition for statesmanship, and he and his father read history and the
      speeches of British orators to some purpose; for one day Sir Austin found
      him leaning cross-legged, and with his hand to his chin, against a
      pedestal supporting the bust of Chatham, contemplating the hero of our
      Parliament, his eyes streaming with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      People said the baronet carried the principle of Example so far that he
      only retained his boozing dyspeptic brother Hippias at Raynham in order to
      exhibit to his son the woeful retribution nature wreaked upon a life of
      indulgence; poor Hippias having now become a walking complaint. This was
      unjust, but there is no doubt he made use of every illustration to disgust
      or encourage his son that his neighbourhood afforded him, and did not
      spare his brother, for whom Richard entertained a contempt in proportion
      to his admiration of his father, and was for flying into penitential
      extremes which Sir Austin had to soften.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy prayed with his father morning and night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it, sir,&rdquo; he said one night, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get Tom Bakewell to pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he refuse?&rdquo; Sir Austin asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to be ashamed to,&rdquo; Richard replied. &ldquo;He wants to know what is
      the good? and I don&rsquo;t know what to tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it has gone too far with him,&rdquo; said Sir Austin, &ldquo;and until he
      has had some deep sorrows he will not find the divine want of Prayer.
      Strive, my son, when you represent the people, to provide for their
      education. He feels everything now through a dull impenetrable rind.
      Culture is half-way to heaven. Tell him, my son, should he ever be brought
      to ask how he may know the efficacy of Prayer, and that his prayer will be
      answered, tell him (he quoted The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip):
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Who rises from Prayer a better man, his prayer is answered.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, sir,&rdquo; said Richard, and went to sleep happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy in his father and in himself, the youth now lived. Conscience was
      beginning to inhabit him, and he carried some of the freightage known to
      men; though in so crude a form that it overweighed him, now on this side,
      now on that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wise youth Adrian observed these further progressionary developments
      in his pupil, soberly cynical. He was under Sir Austin&rsquo;s interdict not to
      banter him, and eased his acrid humours inspired by the sight of a
      felonious young rick-burner turning saint, by grave affectations of
      sympathy and extreme accuracy in marking the not widely-distant dates of
      his various changes. The Bread-and-water phase lasted a fortnight: the
      Vegetarian (an imitation of his cousin Austin), little better than a
      month: the religious, somewhat longer: the religious-propagandist (when he
      was for converting the heathen of Lobourne and Burnley, and the domestics
      of the Abbey, including Tom Bakewell), longer still, and hard to bear;&mdash;he
      tried to convert Adrian! All the while Tom was being exercised like a raw
      recruit. Richard had a drill-sergeant from the nearest barracks down for
      him, to give him a proper pride in himself, and marched him to and fro
      with immense satisfaction, and nearly broke his heart trying to get the
      round-shouldered rustic to take in the rudiments of letters: for the boy
      had unbounded hopes for Tom, as a hero in grain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard&rsquo;s pride also was cast aside. He affected to be, and really thought
      he was, humble. Whereupon Adrian, as by accident, imparted to him the fact
      that men were animals, and he an animal with the rest of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I an animal!&rdquo; cries Richard in scorn, and for weeks he was as troubled by
      this rudiment of self-knowledge as Tom by his letters. Sir Austin had him
      instructed in the wonders of anatomy, to restore his self-respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seed-Time passed thus smoothly, and adolescence came on, and his cousin
      Clare felt what it was to be of an opposite sex to him. She too was
      growing, but nobody cared how she grew. Outwardly even her mother seemed
      absorbed in the sprouting of the green off-shoot of the Feverel tree, and
      Clare was his handmaiden, little marked by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Blandish honestly loved the boy. She would tell him: &ldquo;If I had been a
      girl, I would have had you for my husband.&rdquo; And he with the frankness of
      his years would reply: &ldquo;And how do you know I would have had you?&rdquo; causing
      her to laugh and call him a silly boy, for had he not heard her say she
      would have had him? Terrible words, he knew not then the meaning of!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t read your father&rsquo;s Book,&rdquo; she said. Her own copy was bound in
      purple velvet, gilt-edged, as decorative ladies like to have holier books,
      and she carried it about with her, and quoted it, and (Adrian remarked to
      Mrs. Doria) hunted a noble quarry, and deliberately aimed at him
      therewith, which Mrs. Doria chose to believe, and regretted her brother
      would not be on his guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; said Lady Blandish, pressing an almondy finger-nail to one of
      the Aphorisms, which instanced how age and adversity must clay-enclose us
      ere we can effectually resist the magnetism of any human creature in our
      path. &ldquo;Can you understand it, child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard informed her that when she read he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, my squire,&rdquo; she touched his cheek and ran her fingers through
      his hair, &ldquo;learn as quick as you can not to be all hither and yon with a
      hundred different attractions, as I was before I met a wise man to guide
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is my father very wise?&rdquo; Richard asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; the lady emphasized her individual judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you&mdash;&rdquo; Richard broke forth, and was stopped by a beating of his
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I&mdash;what?&rdquo; she calmly queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to say, do you&mdash;I mean, I love him so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Blandish smiled and slightly coloured.
    </p>
    <p>
      They frequently approached this theme, and always retreated from it;
      always with the same beating of heart to Richard, accompanied by the sense
      of a growing mystery, which, however, did not as yet generally disturb
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life was made very pleasant to him at Raynham, as it was part of Sir
      Austin&rsquo;s principle of education that his boy should be thoroughly joyous
      and happy; and whenever Adrian sent in a satisfactory report of his
      pupil&rsquo;s advancement, which he did pretty liberally, diversions were
      planned, just as prizes are given to diligent school-boys, and Richard was
      supposed to have all his desires gratified while he attended to his
      studies. The System flourished. Tall, strong, bloomingly healthy, he took
      the lead of his companions on land and water, and had more than one
      bondsman in his service besides Ripton Thompson&mdash;the boy without a
      Destiny! Perhaps the boy with a Destiny was growing up a trifle too
      conscious of it. His generosity to his occasional companions was princely,
      but was exercised something too much in the manner of a prince; and,
      notwithstanding his contempt for baseness, he would overlook that more
      easily than an offence to his pride, which demanded an utter servility
      when it had once been rendered susceptible. If Richard had his followers
      he had also his feuds. The Papworths were as subservient as Ripton, but
      young Ralph Morton, the nephew of Mr. Morton, and a match for Richard in
      numerous promising qualities, comprising the noble science of fisticuffs,
      this youth spoke his mind too openly, and moreover would not be snubbed.
      There was no middle course for Richard&rsquo;s comrades between high friendship
      or absolute slavery. He was deficient in those cosmopolite habits and
      feelings which enable boys and men to hold together without caring much
      for each other; and, like every insulated mortal, he attributed the
      deficiency, of which he was quite aware, to the fact of his possessing a
      superior nature. Young Ralph was a lively talker: therefore, argued
      Richard&rsquo;s vanity, he had no intellect. He was affable: therefore he was
      frivolous. The women liked him: therefore he was a butterfly. In fine,
      young Ralph was popular, and our superb prince, denied the privilege of
      despising, ended by detesting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the days of their contention for leadership, Richard saw the
      absurdity of affecting to scorn his rival. Ralph was an Eton boy, and
      hence, being robust, a swimmer and a cricketer. A swimmer and a cricketer
      is nowhere to be scorned in youth&rsquo;s republic. Finding that manoeuvre would
      not do, Richard was prompted once or twice to entrench himself behind his
      greater wealth and his position; but he soon abandoned that also, partly
      because his chilliness to ridicule told him he was exposing himself, and
      chiefly that his heart was too chivalrous. And so he was dragged into the
      lists by Ralph, and experienced the luck of champions. For cricket, and
      for diving, Ralph bore away the belt: Richard&rsquo;s middle-stump tottered
      before his ball, and he could seldom pick up more than three eggs
      underwater to Ralph&rsquo;s half-dozen. He was beaten, too, in jumping and
      running. Why will silly mortals strive to the painful pinnacles of
      championship? Or why, once having reached them, not have the magnanimity
      and circumspection to retire into private life immediately? Stung by his
      defeats, Richard sent one of his dependent Papworths to Poer Hall, with a
      challenge to Ralph Barthrop Morton; matching himself to swim across the
      Thames and back, once, trice, or thrice, within a less time than he, Ralph
      Barthrop Morton, would require for the undertaking. It was accepted, and a
      reply returned, equally formal in the trumpeting of Christian names,
      wherein Ralph Barthrop Morton acknowledged the challenge of Richard Doria
      Feverel, and was his man. The match came off on a midsummer morning, under
      the direction of Captain Algernon. Sir Austin was a spectator from the
      cover of a plantation by the river-side, unknown to his son, and, to the
      scandal of her sex, Lady Blandish accompanied the baronet. He had invited
      her attendance, and she, obeying her frank nature, and knowing what The
      Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip said about prudes, at once agreed to view the match,
      pleasing him mightily. For was not here a woman worthy the Golden Ages of
      the world? one who could look upon man as a creature divinely made, and
      look with a mind neither tempted, nor taunted, by the Serpent! Such a
      woman was rare. Sir Austin did not discompose her by uttering his praises.
      She was conscious of his approval only in an increased gentleness of
      manner, and something in his voice and communications, as if he were
      speaking to a familiar, a very high compliment from him. While the lads
      were standing ready for the signal to plunge from the steep decline of
      greensward into the shining waters, Sir Austin called upon her to admire
      their beauty, and she did, and even advanced her head above his shoulder
      delicately. In so doing, and just as the start was given, a bonnet became
      visible to Richard. Young Ralph was heels in air before he moved, and then
      he dropped like lead. He was beaten by several lengths.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of the match was unaccountable to all present, and Richard&rsquo;s
      friends unanimously pressed him to plead a false start. But though the
      youth, with full confidence in his better style and equal strength, had
      backed himself heavily against his rival, and had lost his little
      river-yacht to Ralph, he would do nothing of the sort. It was the Bonnet
      had beaten him, not Ralph. The Bonnet, typical of the mystery that caused
      his heart those violent palpitations, was his dear, detestable enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, as he progressed from mood to mood, his ambition turned towards a
      field where Ralph could not rival him, and where the Bonnet was
      etherealized, and reigned glorious mistress. A cheek to the pride of a boy
      will frequently divert him to the path where lie his subtlest powers.
      Richard gave up his companions, servile or antagonistic: he relinquished
      the material world to young Ralph, and retired into himself, where he was
      growing to be lord of kingdoms where Beauty was his handmaid, and History
      his minister and Time his ancient harper, and sweet Romance his bride;
      where he walked in a realm vaster and more gorgeous than the great Orient,
      peopled with the heroes that have been. For there is no princely wealth,
      and no loftiest heritage, to equal this early one that is made bountifully
      common to so many, when the ripening blood has put a spark to the
      imagination, and the earth is seen through rosy mists of a thousand
      fresh-awakened nameless and aimless desires; panting for bliss and taking
      it as it comes; making of any sight or sound, perforce of the enchantment
      they carry with them, a key to infinite, because innocent, pleasure. The
      passions then are gambolling cubs; not the ravaging gluttons they grow to.
      They have their teeth and their talons, but they neither tear nor bite.
      They are in counsel and fellowship with the quickened heart and brain. The
      whole sweet system moves to music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something akin to the indications of a change in the spirit of his son,
      which were now seen, Sir Austin had marked down to be expected, as due to
      his plan. The blushes of the youth, his long vigils, his clinging to
      solitude, his abstraction, and downcast but not melancholy air, were
      matters for rejoicing to the prescient gentleman. &ldquo;For it comes,&rdquo; said he
      to Dr. Clifford of Lobourne, after consulting him medically on the youth&rsquo;s
      behalf and being assured of his soundness, &ldquo;it comes of a thoroughly sane
      condition. The blood is healthy, the mind virtuous: neither instigates the
      other to evil, and both are perfecting toward the flower of manhood. If he
      reach that pure&mdash;in the untainted fulness and perfection of his
      natural powers&mdash;I am indeed a happy father! But one thing he will owe
      to me: that at one period of his life he knew paradise, and could read
      God&rsquo;s handwriting on the earth! Now those abominations whom you call
      precocious boys&mdash;your little pet monsters, doctor!&mdash;and who can
      wonder that the world is what it is? when it is full of them&mdash;as they
      will have no divine time to look back upon in their own lives, how can
      they believe in innocence and goodness, or be other than sons of
      selfishness and the Devil? But my boy,&rdquo; and the baronet dropped his voice
      to a key that was touching to hear, &ldquo;my boy, if he fall, will fall from an
      actual region of purity. He dare not be a sceptic as to that. Whatever his
      darkness, he will have the guiding light of a memory behind him. So much
      is secure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To talk nonsense, or poetry, or the dash between the two, in a tone of
      profound sincerity, and to enunciate solemn discordances with received
      opinion so seriously as to convey the impression of a spiritual insight,
      is the peculiar gift by which monomaniacs, having first persuaded
      themselves, contrive to influence their neighbours, and through them to
      make conquest of a good half of the world, for good or for ill. Sir Austin
      had this gift. He spoke as if he saw the truth, and, persisting in it so
      long, he was accredited by those who did not understand him, and silenced
      them that did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; was all the argument left to Dr. Clifford, and other
      unbelievers.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far certainly the experiment had succeeded. A comelier, bracer, better
      boy was nowhere to be met. His promise was undeniable. The vessel, too,
      though it lay now in harbour and had not yet been proved by the buffets of
      the elements on the great ocean, had made a good trial trip, and got well
      through stormy weather, as the records of the Bakewell Comedy witnessed to
      at Raynham. No augury could be hopefuller. The Fates must indeed be hard,
      the Ordeal severe, the Destiny dark, that could destroy so bright a
      Spring! But, bright as it was, the baronet relaxed nothing of his vigilant
      supervision. He said to his intimates: &ldquo;Every act, every fostered
      inclination, almost every thought, in this Blossoming Season, bears its
      seed for the Future. The living Tree now requires incessant watchfulness.&rdquo;
       And, acting up to his light, Sir Austin did watch. The youth submitted to
      an examination every night before he sought his bed; professedly to give
      an account of his studies, but really to recapitulate his moral
      experiences of the day. He could do so, for he was pure. Any wildness in
      him that his father noted, any remoteness or richness of fancy in his
      expressions, was set down as incidental to the Blossoming Season. There is
      nothing like a theory for binding the wise. Sir Austin, despite his rigid
      watch and ward, knew less of his son than the servant of his household.
      And he was deaf, as well as blind. Adrian thought it his duty to tell him
      that the youth was consuming paper. Lady Blandish likewise hinted at his
      mooning propensities. Sir Austin from his lofty watch-tower of the System
      had foreseen it, he said. But when he came to hear that the youth was
      writing poetry, his wounded heart had its reasons for being much
      disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said Lady Blandish, &ldquo;you knew he scribbled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very different thing from writing poetry,&rdquo; said the baronet. &ldquo;No
      Feverel has ever written poetry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a sign of degeneracy,&rdquo; the lady remarked. &ldquo;He rhymes
      very prettily to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A London phrenologist, and a friendly Oxford Professor of poetry, quieted
      Sir Austin&rsquo;s fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The phrenologist said he was totally deficient in the imitative faculty;
      and the Professor, that he was equally so in the rhythmic, and instanced
      several consoling false quantities in the few effusions submitted to him.
      Added to this, Sir Austin told Lady Blandish that Richard had, at his
      best, done what no poet had ever been known to be capable of doing: he
      had, with his own hands, and in cold blood, committed his virgin
      manuscript to the flames: which made Lady Blandish sigh forth, &ldquo;Poor boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Killing one&rsquo;s darling child is a painful imposition. For a youth in his
      Blossoming Season, who fancies himself a poet, to be requested to destroy
      his first-born, without a reason (though to pretend a reason cogent enough
      to justify the request were a mockery), is a piece of abhorrent despotism,
      and Richard&rsquo;s blossoms withered under it. A strange man had been
      introduced to him, who traversed and bisected his skull with sagacious
      stiff fingers, and crushed his soul while, in an infallible voice,
      declaring him the animal he was making him feel such an animal! Not only
      his blossoms withered, his being seemed to draw in its shoots and twigs.
      And when, coupled thereunto (the strange man having departed, his work
      done), his father, in his tenderest manner, stated that it would give him
      pleasure to see those same precocious, utterly valueless, scribblings
      among the cinders, the last remaining mental blossoms spontaneously fell
      away. Richard&rsquo;s spirit stood bare. He protested not. Enough that it could
      be wished! He would not delay a minute in doing it. Desiring his father to
      follow him, he went to a drawer in his room, and from a clean-linen
      recess, never suspected by Sir Austin, the secretive youth drew out bundle
      after bundle: each neatly tied, named, and numbered: and pitched them into
      flames. And so Farewell my young Ambition! and with it farewell all true
      confidence between Father and Son.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was now, as Sir Austin had written it down, The Magnetic Age: the Age
      of violent attractions, when to hear mention of love is dangerous, and to
      see it, a communication of the disease. People at Raynham were put on
      their guard by the baronet, and his reputation for wisdom was severely
      criticized in consequence of the injunctions he thought fit to issue
      through butler and housekeeper down to the lower household, for the
      preservation of his son from any visible symptom of the passion. A footman
      and two housemaids are believed to have been dismissed on the report of
      heavy Benson that they were in or inclining to the state; upon which an
      undercook and a dairymaid voluntarily threw up their places, averring that
      &ldquo;they did not want no young men, but to have their sex spied after by an
      old wretch like that,&rdquo; indicating the ponderous butler, &ldquo;was a little too
      much for a Christian woman,&rdquo; and then they were ungenerous enough to
      glance at Benson&rsquo;s well-known marital calamity, hinting that some men met
      their deserts. So intolerable did heavy Benson&rsquo;s espionage become, that
      Raynham would have grown depopulated of its womankind had not Adrian
      interfered, who pointed out to the baronet what a fearful arm his butler
      was wielding. Sir Austin acknowledged it despondently. &ldquo;It only shows,&rdquo;
       said he, with a fine spirit of justice, &ldquo;how all but impossible it is to
      legislate where there are women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not object,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;I hope I am too just to object to the
      exercise of their natural inclinations. All I ask from them is
      discreetness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Adrian, whose discreetness was a marvel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No gadding about in couples,&rdquo; continued the baronet, &ldquo;no kissing in
      public. Such occurrences no boy should witness. Whenever people of both
      sexes are thrown together, they will be silly; and where they are
      high-fed, uneducated, and barely occupied, it must be looked for as a
      matter of course. Let it be known that I only require discreetness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Discreetness, therefore, was instructed to reign at the Abbey. Under
      Adrian&rsquo;s able tuition the fairest of its domestics acquired that virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Discreetness, too, was enjoined to the upper household. Sir Austin, who
      had not previously appeared to notice the case of Lobourne&rsquo;s hopeless
      curate, now desired Mrs. Doria to interdict, or at least discourage, his
      visits, for the appearance of the man was that of an embodied sigh and
      groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Austin!&rdquo; said Mrs. Doria, astonished to find her brother more
      awake than she had supposed, &ldquo;I have never allowed him to hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him see it, then,&rdquo; replied the baronet; &ldquo;let him see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man amuses me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Doria. &ldquo;You know, we have few amusements
      here, we inferior creatures. I confess I should like a barrel-organ
      better; that reminds one of town and the opera; and besides, it plays more
      than one tune. However, since you think my society bad for him, let him
      stop away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the self-devotion of a woman she grew patient and sweet the moment
      her daughter Clare was spoken of, and the business of her life in view.
      Mrs. Doria&rsquo;s maternal heart had betrothed the two cousins, Richard and
      Clare; had already beheld them espoused and fruitful. For this she yielded
      the pleasures of town; for this she immured herself at Raynham; for this
      she bore with a thousand follies, exactions, inconveniences, things
      abhorrent to her, and heaven knows what forms of torture and self-denial,
      which are smilingly endured by that greatest of voluntary martyrs&mdash;a
      mother with a daughter to marry. Mrs. Doria, an amiable widow, had surely
      married but for her daughter Clare. The lady&rsquo;s hair no woman could possess
      without feeling it her pride. It was the daily theme of her lady&rsquo;s-maid,&mdash;a
      natural aureole to her head. She was gay, witty, still physically youthful
      enough to claim a destiny; and she sacrificed it to accomplish her
      daughter&rsquo;s! sacrificed, as with heroic scissors, hair, wit, gaiety&mdash;let
      us not attempt to enumerate how much! more than may be said. And she was
      only one of thousands; thousands who have no portion of the hero&rsquo;s reward;
      for he may reckon on applause, and condolence, and sympathy, and honour;
      they, poor slaves! must look for nothing but the opposition of their own
      sex and the sneers of ours. O, Sir Austin! had you not been so blinded,
      what an Aphorism might have sprung from this point of observation! Mrs.
      Doria was coolly told, between sister and brother, that during the
      Magnetic Age her daughter&rsquo;s presence at Raynham was undesirable. Instead
      of nursing offence, her sole thought was the mountain of prejudice she had
      to contend against. She bowed, and said, Clare wanted sea-air&mdash;she
      had never quite recovered the shock of that dreadful night. How long, Mrs.
      Doria wished to know, might the Peculiar Period be expected to last?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Sir Austin, &ldquo;depends. A year, perhaps. He is entering on it.
      I shall be most grieved to lose you, Helen. Clare is now&mdash;how old?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventeen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is marriageable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marriageable, Austin! at seventeen! don&rsquo;t name such a thing. My child
      shall not be robbed of her youth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our women marry early, Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child shall not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baronet reflected a moment. He did not wish to lose his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you are of that opinion, Helen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;perhaps we may still make
      arrangements to retain you with us. Would you think it advisable to send
      Clare&mdash;she should know discipline&mdash;to some establishment for a
      few months?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To an asylum, Austin?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Doria, controlling her indignation as
      well as she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To some select superior seminary, Helen. There are such to be found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Austin!&rdquo; Mrs. Doria exclaimed, and had to fight with a moisture in her
      eyes. &ldquo;Unjust! absurd!&rdquo; she murmured. The baronet thought it a natural
      proposition that Clare should be a bride or a schoolgirl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot leave my child.&rdquo; Mrs. Doria trembled. &ldquo;Where she goes, I go. I
      am aware that she is only one of our sex, and therefore of no value to the
      world, but she is my child. I will see, poor dear, that you have no cause
      to complain of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; Sir Austin remarked, &ldquo;that you acquiesced in my views with
      regard to my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;generally,&rdquo; said Mrs. Doria, and felt culpable that she had not
      before, and could not then, tell her brother that he had set up an Idol in
      his house&mdash;an Idol of flesh! more retributive and abominable than
      wood or brass or gold. But she had bowed to the Idol too long&mdash;she
      had too entirely bound herself to gain her project by subserviency. She
      had, and she dimly perceived it, committed a greater fault in tactics, in
      teaching her daughter to bow to the Idol also. Love of that kind Richard
      took for tribute. He was indifferent to Clare&rsquo;s soft eyes. The parting
      kiss he gave her was ready and cold as his father could desire. Sir Austin
      now grew eloquent to him in laudation of manly pursuits: but Richard
      thought his eloquence barren, his attempts at companionship awkward, and
      all manly pursuits and aims, life itself, vain and worthless. To what end?
      sighed the blossomless youth, and cried aloud, as soon as he was relieved
      of his father&rsquo;s society, what was the good of anything? Whatever he did&mdash;whichever
      path he selected, led back to Raynham. And whatever he did, however
      wretched and wayward he showed himself, only confirmed Sir Austin more and
      more in the truth of his previsions. Tom Bakewell, now the youth&rsquo;s groom,
      had to give the baronet a report of his young master&rsquo;s proceedings, in
      common with Adrian, and while there was no harm to tell, Tom spoke out.
      &ldquo;He do ride like fire every day to Pig&rsquo;s Snout,&rdquo; naming the highest hill
      in the neighbourhood, &ldquo;and stand there and stare, never movin&rsquo;, like a mad
      &lsquo;un. And then hoam agin all slack as if he&rsquo;d been beaten in a race by
      somebody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no woman in that!&rdquo; mused the baronet. &ldquo;He would have ridden back
      as hard as he went,&rdquo; reflected this profound scientific humanist, &ldquo;had
      there been a woman in it. He would shun vast expanses, and seek shade,
      concealment, solitude. The desire for distances betokens emptiness and
      undirected hunger: when the heart is possessed by an image we fly to wood
      and forest, like the guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian&rsquo;s report accused his pupil of an extraordinary access of cynicism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said the baronet. &ldquo;As I foresaw. At this period an insatiate
      appetite is accompanied by a fastidious palate. Nothing but the
      quintessences of existence, and those in exhaustless supplies, will
      satisfy this craving, which is not to be satisfied! Hence his bitterness.
      Life can furnish no food fitting for him. The strength and purity of his
      energies have reached to an almost divine height, and roam through the
      Inane. Poetry, love, and such-like, are the drugs earth has to offer to
      high natures, as she offers to low ones debauchery. &lsquo;Tis a sign, this
      sourness, that he is subject to none of the empiricisms that are afloat.
      Now to keep him clear of them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Titans had an easier task in storming Olympus. As yet, however, it
      could not be said that Sir Austin&rsquo;s System had failed. On the contrary, it
      had reared a youth, handsome, intelligent, well-bred, and, observed the
      ladies, with acute emphasis, innocent. Where, they asked, was such another
      young man to be found?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Lady Blandish to Sir Austin, &ldquo;if men could give their hands to
      women unsoiled&mdash;how different would many a marriage be! She will be a
      happy girl who calls Richard husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy, indeed!&rdquo; was the baronet&rsquo;s caustic ejaculation. &ldquo;But where shall I
      meet one equal to him, and his match?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was innocent when I was a girl,&rdquo; said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin bowed a reserved opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think no girls innocent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin gallantly thought them all so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that you know they are not,&rdquo; said the lady, stamping. &ldquo;But they are
      more innocent than boys, I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of their education, madam. You see now what a youth can be.
      Perhaps, when my System is published, or rather&mdash;to speak more humbly&mdash;when
      it is practised, the balance may be restored, and we shall have virtuous
      young men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late for poor me to hope for a husband from one of them,&rdquo; said
      the lady, pouting and laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is never too late for beauty to waken love,&rdquo; returned the baronet, and
      they trifled a little. They were approaching Daphne&rsquo;s Bower, which they
      entered, and sat there to taste the coolness of a descending midsummer
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baronet seemed in a humour for dignified fooling; the lady for serious
      converse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall believe again in Arthur&rsquo;s knights,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When I was a girl
      I dreamed of one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he was in quest of the San Greal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And showed his good taste by turning aside for the more tangible San
      Blandish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you consider it would have been so,&rdquo; sighed the lady, ruffling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only judge by our generation,&rdquo; said Sir Austin, with a bend of
      homage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady gathered her mouth. &ldquo;Either we are very mighty or you are very
      weak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But whatever we are, and if we are bad, bad! we love virtue, and truth,
      and lofty souls, in men: and, when we meet those qualities in them, we are
      constant, and would die for them&mdash;die for them. Ah! you know men but
      not women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The knights possessing such distinctions must be young, I presume?&rdquo; said
      Sir Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old, or young!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if old, they are scarce capable of enterprise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are loved for themselves, not for their deeds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;ah!&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;Intellect may subdue women&mdash;make
      slaves of them; and they worship beauty perhaps as much as you do. But
      they only love for ever and are mated when they meet a noble nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin looked at her wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you encounter the knight of your dream?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not then.&rdquo; She lowered her eyelids. It was prettily done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did you bear the disappointment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dream was in the nursery. The day my frock was lengthened to a gown I
      stood at the altar. I am not the only girl that has been made a woman in a
      day, and given to an ogre instead of a true knight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Austin, &ldquo;women have much to bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the couple changed characters. The lady became gay as the baronet
      grew earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know it is our lot,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And we are allowed many amusements.
      If we fulfil our duty in producing children, that, like our virtue, is its
      own reward. Then, as a widow, I have wonderful privileges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To preserve which, you remain a widow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she responded. &ldquo;I have no trouble now in patching and piecing
      that rag the world calls&mdash;a character. I can sit at your feet every
      day unquestioned. To be sure, others do the same, but they are female
      eccentrics, and have cast off the rag altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin drew nearer to her. &ldquo;You would have made an admirable mother,
      madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This from Sir Austin was very like positive wooing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;ten thousand pities that you are not one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; She spoke with humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that heaven had given you a daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have thought her worthy of Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our blood, madam, should have been one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady tapped her toe with her parasol. &ldquo;But I am a mother,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;Richard is my son. Yes! Richard is my boy,&rdquo; she reiterated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin most graciously appended, &ldquo;Call him ours, madam,&rdquo; and held his
      head as if to catch the word from her lips, which, however, she chose to
      refuse, or defer. They made the coloured West a common point for their
      eyes, and then Sir Austin said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you will not say &lsquo;ours,&rsquo; let me. And, as you have therefore an equal
      claim on the boy, I will confide to you a project I have lately
      conceived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The announcement of a project hardly savoured of a coming proposal, but
      for Sir Austin to confide one to a woman was almost tantamount to a
      declaration. So Lady Blandish thought, and so said her soft, deep-eyed
      smile, as she perused the ground while listening to the project. It
      concerned Richard&rsquo;s nuptials. He was now nearly eighteen. He was to marry
      when he was five-and-twenty. Meantime a young lady, some years his junior,
      was to be sought for in the homes of England, who would be every way
      fitted by education, instincts, and blood&mdash;on each of which
      qualifications Sir Austin unreservedly enlarged&mdash;to espouse so
      perfect a youth and accept the honourable duty of assisting in the
      perpetuation of the Feverels. The baronet went on to say that he proposed
      to set forth immediately, and devote a couple of months, to the first
      essay in his Coelebite search.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; said Lady Blandish, when the project had been fully unfolded,
      &ldquo;you have laid down for yourself a difficult task. You must not be too
      exacting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it.&rdquo; The baronet&rsquo;s shake of the head was piteous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even in England she will be rare. But I confine myself to no class. If I
      ask for blood it is for untainted, not what you call high blood. I believe
      many of the middle classes are frequently more careful&mdash;more
      pure-blooded&mdash;than our aristocracy. Show me among them a God-fearing
      family who educate their children&mdash;I should prefer a girl without
      brothers and sisters&mdash;as a Christian damsel should be educated&mdash;say,
      on the model of my son, and she may be penniless, I will pledge her to
      Richard Feverel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Blandish bit her lip. &ldquo;And what do you do with Richard while you are
      absent on this expedition?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the baronet, &ldquo;he accompanies his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then give it up. His future bride is now pinafored and bread-and-buttery.
      She romps, she cries, she dreams of play and pudding. How can he care for
      her? He thinks more at his age of old women like me. He will be certain to
      kick against her, and destroy your plan, believe me, Sir Austin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay? ay? do you think that?&rdquo; said the baronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Blandish gave him a multitude of reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! true,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Adrian said the same. He must not see her. How
      could I think of it! The child is naked woman. He would despise her.
      Naturally!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally!&rdquo; echoed the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, madam,&rdquo; and the baronet rose, &ldquo;there is one thing for me to
      determine upon. I must, for the first time in his life, leave him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you, indeed?&rdquo; said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my duty, having thus brought him up, to see that he is properly
      mated,&mdash;not wrecked upon the quicksands of marriage, as a youth so
      delicately trained might be; more easily than another! Betrothed, he will
      be safe from a thousand snares. I may, I think, leave him for a term. My
      precautions have saved him from the temptations of his season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And under whose charge will you leave him?&rdquo; Lady Blandish inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had emerged from the temple, and stood beside Sir Austin on the upper
      steps, under a clear summer twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam!&rdquo; he took her hand, and his voice was gallant and tender, &ldquo;under
      whose but yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the baronet said this, he bent above her hand, and raised it to his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Blandish felt that she had been wooed and asked in wedlock. She did
      not withdraw her hand. The baronet&rsquo;s salute was flatteringly reverent. He
      deliberated over it, as one going through a grave ceremony. And he, the
      scorner of women, had chosen her for his homage! Lady Blandish forgot that
      she had taken some trouble to arrive at it. She received the exquisite
      compliment in all its unique honey-sweet: for in love we must deserve
      nothing or the fine bloom of fruition is gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady&rsquo;s hand was still in durance, and the baronet had not recovered
      from his profound inclination, when a noise from the neighbouring
      beechwood startled the two actors in this courtly pantomime. They turned
      their heads, and beheld the hope of Raynham on horseback surveying the
      scene. The next moment he had galloped away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      All night Richard tossed on his bed with his heart in a rapid canter, and
      his brain bestriding it, traversing the rich untasted world, and the great
      Realm of Mystery, from which he was now restrained no longer. Months he
      had wandered about the gates of the Bonnet, wondering, sighing, knocking
      at them, and getting neither admittance nor answer. He had the key now.
      His own father had given it to him. His heart was a lightning steed, and
      bore him on and on over limitless regions bathed in superhuman beauty and
      strangeness, where cavaliers and ladies leaned whispering upon close green
      swards, and knights and ladies cast a splendour upon savage forests, and
      tilts and tourneys were held in golden courts lit to a glorious day by
      ladies&rsquo; eyes, one pair of which, dimly visioned, constantly
      distinguishable, followed him through the boskage and dwelt upon him in
      the press, beaming while he bent above a hand glittering white and
      fragrant as the frosted blossom of a May night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Awhile the heart would pause and flutter to a shock: he was in the act of
      consummating all earthly bliss by pressing his lips to the small white
      hand. Only to do that, and die! cried the Magnetic Youth: to fling the
      Jewel of Life into that one cup and drink it off! He was intoxicated by
      anticipation. For that he was born. There was, then, some end in
      existence, something to live for! to kiss a woman&rsquo;s hand, and die! He
      would leap from the couch, and rush to pen and paper to relieve his
      swarming sensations. Scarce was he seated when the pen was dashed aside,
      the paper sent flying with the exclamation, &ldquo;Have I not sworn I would
      never write again?&rdquo; Sir Austin had shut that safety-valve. The nonsense
      that was in the youth might have poured harmlessly out, and its urgency
      for ebullition was so great that he was repeatedly oblivious of his oath,
      and found himself seated under the lamp in the act of composition before
      pride could speak a word. Possibly the pride even of Richard Feverel had
      been swamped if the act of composition were easy at such a time, and a
      single idea could stand clearly foremost; but myriads were demanding the
      first place; chaotic hosts, like ranks of stormy billows, pressed
      impetuously for expression, and despair of reducing them to form, quite as
      much as pride, to which it pleased him to refer his incapacity, threw down
      the powerless pen, and sent him panting to his outstretched length and
      another headlong career through the rosy-girdled land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward morning the madness of the fever abated somewhat, and he went forth
      into the air. A lamp was still burning in his father&rsquo;s room, and Richard
      thought, as he looked up, that he saw the ever-vigilant head on the watch.
      Instantly the lamp was extinguished, the window stood cold against the
      hues of dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong pulling is an excellent medical remedy for certain classes of
      fever. Richard took to it instinctively. The clear fresh water, burnished
      with sunrise, sparkled against his arrowy prow; the soft deep shadows
      curled smiling away from his gliding keel. Overhead solitary morning
      unfolded itself, from blossom to bud, from bud to flower; still, delicious
      changes of light and colour, to whose influences he was heedless as he
      shot under willows and aspens, and across sheets of river-reaches, pure
      mirrors to the upper glory, himself the sole tenant of the stream.
      Somewhere at the founts of the world lay the land he was rowing toward;
      something of its shadowed lights might be discerned here and there. It was
      not a dream, now he knew. There was a secret abroad. The woods were full
      of it; the waters rolled with it, and the winds. Oh, why could not one in
      these days do some high knightly deed which should draw down ladies&rsquo; eyes
      from their heaven, as in the days of Arthur! To such a meaning breathed
      the unconscious sighs of the youth, when he had pulled through his first
      feverish energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was off Bursley, and had lapsed a little into that musing quietude
      which follows strenuous exercise, when he heard a hail and his own name
      called. It was no lady, no fairy, but young Ralph Morton, an irruption of
      miserable masculine prose. Heartily wishing him abed with the rest of
      mankind, Richard rowed in and jumped ashore. Ralph immediately seized his
      arm, saying that he desired earnestly to have a talk with him, and dragged
      the Magnetic Youth from his water-dreams, up and down the wet mown grass.
      That he had to say seemed to be difficult of utterance, and Richard,
      though he barely listened, soon had enough of his old rival&rsquo;s gladness at
      seeing him, and exhibited signs of impatience; whereat Ralph, as one who
      branches into matter somewhat foreign to his mind, but of great human
      interest and importance, put the question to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, what woman&rsquo;s name do you like best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any,&rdquo; quoth Richard, indifferently. &ldquo;Why are you out so
      early?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In answer to this, Ralph suggested that the name of Mary might be
      considered a pretty name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard agreed that it might be; the housekeeper at Raynham, half the
      women cooks, and all the housemaids enjoyed that name; the name of Mary
      was equivalent for women at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Ralph. &ldquo;We have lots of Marys. It&rsquo;s so common. Oh! I
      don&rsquo;t like Mary best. What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard thought it just like another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; Ralph continued, throwing off the mask and plunging into
      the subject, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do anything on earth for some names&mdash;one or two.
      It&rsquo;s not Mary, nor Lucy. Clarinda&rsquo;s pretty, but it&rsquo;s like a novel.
      Claribel, I like. Names beginning with &lsquo;Cl&rsquo; I prefer. The &lsquo;Cl&rsquo;s&rsquo; are
      always gentle and lovely girls you would die for! Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard had never been acquainted with any of them to inspire that
      emotion. Indeed these urgent appeals to his fancy in feminine names at
      five o&rsquo;clock in the morning slightly surprised him, though he was but half
      awake to the outer world. By degrees he perceived that Ralph was changed.
      Instead of the lusty boisterous boy, his rival in manly sciences, who
      spoke straightforwardly and acted up to his speech, here was an abashed
      and blush-persecuted youth, who sued piteously for a friendly ear wherein
      to pour the one idea possessing him. Gradually, too, Richard apprehended
      that Ralph likewise was on the frontiers of the Realm of Mystery, perhaps
      further toward it than he himself was; and then, as by a sympathetic
      stroke, was revealed to him the wonderful beauty and depth of meaning in
      feminine names. The theme appeared novel and delicious, fitted to the
      season and the hour. But the hardship was, that Richard could choose none
      from the number; all were the same to him; he loved them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you really prefer the &lsquo;Cl&rsquo;s&rsquo;?&rdquo; said Ralph, persuasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not better than the names ending in &lsquo;a&rsquo; and &lsquo;y,&rsquo; Richard replied, wishing
      he could, for Ralph was evidently ahead of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come under these trees,&rdquo; said Ralph. And under the trees Ralph unbosomed.
      His name was down for the army: Eton was quitted for ever. In a few months
      he would have to join his regiment, and before he left he must say goodbye
      to his friends.... Would Richard tell him Mrs. Forey&rsquo;s address? he had
      heard she was somewhere by the sea. Richard did not remember the address,
      but said he would willingly take charge of any letter and forward it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph dived his hand into his pocket. &ldquo;Here it is. But don&rsquo;t let anybody
      see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My aunt&rsquo;s name is not Clare,&rdquo; said Richard, perusing what was composed of
      the exterior formula. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve addressed it to Clare herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was plain to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emmeline Clementina Matilda Laura, Countess Blandish,&rdquo; Richard continued
      in a low tone, transferring the names, and playing on the musical strings
      they were to him. Then he said: &ldquo;Names of ladies! How they sweeten their
      names!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fixed his eyes on Ralph. If he discovered anything further he said
      nothing, but bade the good fellow good-bye, jumped into his boat, and
      pulled down the tide. The moment Ralph was hidden by an abutment of the
      banks, Richard perused the address. For the first time it struck him that
      his cousin Clare was a very charming creature: he remembered the look of
      her eyes, and especially the last reproachful glance she gave him at
      parting. What business had Ralph to write to her? Did she not belong to
      Richard Feverel? He read the words again and again: Clare Doria Forey.
      Why, Clare was the name he liked best&mdash;nay, he loved it. Doria, too&mdash;she
      shared his own name with him. Away went his heart, not at a canter now, at
      a gallop, as one who sights the quarry. He felt too weak to pull. Clare
      Doria Forey&mdash;oh, perfect melody! Sliding with the tide, he heard it
      fluting in the bosom of the hills.
    </p>

      When nature has made us ripe for love, it seldom occurs that the Fates are
      behindhand in furnishing a temple for the flame.

      Above green-flashing plunges of a weir, and shaken by the thunder below,
      lilies, golden and white, were swaying at anchor among the reeds.
      Meadow-sweet hung from the banks thick with weed and trailing bramble, and
      there also hung a daughter of earth. Her face was shaded by a broad straw
      hat with a flexible brim that left her lips and chin in the sun, and,
      sometimes nodding, sent forth a light of promising eyes. Across her
      shoulders, and behind, flowed large loose curls, brown in shadow, almost
      golden where the ray touched them. She was simply dressed, befitting
      decency and the season. On a closer inspection you might see that her lips
      were stained. This blooming young person was regaling on dewberries. They
      grew between the bank and the water. Apparently she found the fruit
      abundant, for her hand was making pretty progress to her mouth. Fastidious
      youth, which revolts at woman plumping her exquisite proportions on
      bread-and-butter, and would (we must suppose) joyfully have her scraggy to
      have her poetical, can hardly object to dewberries. Indeed the act of
      eating them is dainty and induces musing. The dewberry is a sister to the
      lotus, and an innocent sister. You eat: mouth, eye, and hand are occupied,
      and the undrugged mind free to roam. And so it was with the damsel who
      knelt there. The little skylark went up above her, all song, to the smooth
      southern cloud lying along the blue: from a dewy copse dark over her
      nodding hat the blackbird fluted, calling to her with thrice mellow note:
      the kingfisher flashed emerald out of green osiers: a bow-winged heron
      travelled aloft, seeking solitude a boat slipped toward her, containing a
      dreamy youth; and still she plucked the fruit, and ate, and mused, as if
      no fairy prince were invading her territories, and as if she wished not
      for one, or knew not her wishes. Surrounded by the green shaven meadows,
      the pastoral summer buzz, the weir-fall&rsquo;s thundering white, amid the
      breath and beauty of wild flowers, she was a bit of lovely human life in a
      fair setting; a terrible attraction. The Magnetic Youth leaned round to
      note his proximity to the weir-piles, and beheld the sweet vision. Stiller
      and stiller grew nature, as at the meeting of two electric clouds. Her
      posture was so graceful, that though he was making straight for the weir,
      he dared not dip a scull. Just then one enticing dewberry caught her eyes.
      He was floating by unheeded, and saw that her hand stretched low, and
      could not gather what it sought. A stroke from his right brought him
      beside her. The damsel glanced up dismayed, and her whole shape trembled
      over the brink. Richard sprang from his boat into the water. Pressing a
      hand beneath her foot, which she had thrust against the crumbling wet
      sides of the bank to save herself, he enabled her to recover her balance,
      and gain safe earth, whither he followed her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      He had landed on an island of the still-vexed Bermoothes. The world lay
      wrecked behind him: Raynham hung in mists, remote, a phantom to the vivid
      reality of this white hand which had drawn him thither away thousands of
      leagues in an eye-twinkle. Hark, how Ariel sang overhead! What splendour
      in the heavens! What marvels of beauty about his enchanted brows! And, O
      you wonder! Fair Flame! by whose light the glories of being are now first
      seen....Radiant Miranda! Prince Ferdinand is at your feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or is it Adam, his rib taken from his side in sleep, and thus transformed,
      to make him behold his Paradise, and lose it?...
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth looked on her with as glowing an eye. It was the First Woman to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she&mdash;mankind was all Caliban to her, saving this one princely
      youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      So to each other said their changing eyes in the moment they stood
      together; he pale, and she blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was indeed sweetly fair, and would have been held fair among rival
      damsels. On a magic shore, and to a youth educated by a System, strung
      like an arrow drawn to the head, he, it might be guessed, could fly fast
      and far with her. The soft rose in her cheeks, the clearness of her eyes,
      bore witness to the body&rsquo;s virtue; and health and happy blood were in her
      bearing. Had she stood before Sir Austin among rival damsels, that
      Scientific Humanist, for the consummation of his System, would have thrown
      her the handkerchief for his son. The wide summer-hat, nodding over her
      forehead to her brows, seemed to flow with the flowing heavy curls, and
      those fire-threaded mellow curls, only half-curls, waves of hair call
      them, rippling at the ends, went like a sunny red-veined torrent down her
      back almost to her waist: a glorious vision to the youth, who embraced it
      as a flower of beauty, and read not a feature. There were curious features
      of colour in her face for him to have read. Her brows, thick and brownish
      against a soft skin showing the action of the blood, met in the bend of a
      bow, extending to the temples long and level: you saw that she was
      fashioned to peruse the sights of earth, and by the pliability of her
      brows that the wonderful creature used her faculty, and was not going to
      be a statue to the gazer. Under the dark thick brows an arch of lashes
      shot out, giving a wealth of darkness to the full frank blue eyes, a
      mystery of meaning&mdash;more than brain was ever meant to fathom: richer,
      henceforth, than all mortal wisdom to Prince Ferdinand. For when nature
      turns artist, and produces contrasts of colour on a fair face, where is
      the Sage, or what the Oracle, shall match the depth of its lightest look?
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Ferdinand was also fair. In his slim boating-attire his figure
      looked heroic. His hair, rising from the parting to the right of his
      forehead, in what his admiring Lady Blandish called his plume, fell away
      slanting silkily to the temples across the nearly imperceptible upward
      curve of his brows there&mdash;felt more than seen, so slight it was&mdash;and
      gave to his profile a bold beauty, to which his bashful, breathless air
      was a flattering charm. An arrow drawn to the head, capable of flying fast
      and far with her! He leaned a little forward, drinking her in with all his
      eyes, and young Love has a thousand. Then truly the System triumphed, just
      ere it was to fall; and could Sir Austin have been content to draw the
      arrow to the head, and let it fly, when it would fly, he might have
      pointed to his son again, and said to the world, &ldquo;Match him!&rdquo; Such keen
      bliss as the youth had in the sight of her, an innocent youth alone has
      powers of soul in him to experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Women!&rdquo; says The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip, in one of its solitary outbursts,
      &ldquo;Women, who like, and will have for hero, a rake! how soon are you not to
      learn that you have taken bankrupts to your bosoms, and that the
      putrescent gold that attracted you is the slime of the Lake of Sin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If these two were Ferdinand and Miranda, Sir Austin was not Prospero, and
      was not present, or their fates might have been different.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they stood a moment, changing eyes, and then Miranda spoke, and they
      came down to earth, feeling no less in heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke to thank him for his aid. She used quite common simple words;
      and used them, no doubt, to express a common simple meaning: but to him
      she was uttering magic, casting spells, and the effect they had on him was
      manifested in the incoherence of his replies, which were too foolish to be
      chronicled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The couple were again mute. Suddenly Miranda, with an exclamation of
      anguish, and innumerable lights and shadows playing over her lovely face,
      clapped her hands, crying aloud, &ldquo;My book! my book!&rdquo; and ran to the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Ferdinand was at her side. &ldquo;What have you lost?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My book!&rdquo; she answered, her delicious curls swinging across her shoulders
      to the stream. Then turning to him, &ldquo;Oh, no, no! let me entreat you not
      to,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I do not so very much mind losing it.&rdquo; And in her
      eagerness to restrain him she unconsciously laid her gentle hand upon his
      arm, and took the force of motion out of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I do not really care for the silly book,&rdquo; she continued,
      withdrawing her hand quickly, and reddening. &ldquo;Pray, do not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young gentleman had kicked off his shoes. No sooner was the spell of
      contact broken than he jumped in. The water was still troubled and
      discoloured by his introductory adventure, and, though he ducked his head
      with the spirit of a dabchick, the book was missing. A scrap of paper
      floating from the bramble just above the water, and looking as if fire had
      caught its edges and it had flown from one adverse element to the other,
      was all he could lay hold of; and he returned to land disconsolately, to
      hear Miranda&rsquo;s murmured mixing of thanks and pretty expostulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me try again,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; she replied, and used the awful threat: &ldquo;I will run away if
      you do,&rdquo; which effectually restrained him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eye fell on the fire-stained scrap of paper, and brightened, as she
      cried, &ldquo;There, there! you have what I want. It is that. I do not care for
      the book. No, please! You are not to look at it. Give it me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before her playfully imperative injunction was fairly spoken, Richard had
      glanced at the document and discovered a Griffin between two Wheatsheaves:
      his crest in silver: and below&mdash;O wonderment immense! his own
      handwriting!
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed it to her. She took it, and put it in her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who would have thought, that, where all else perished, Odes, Idyls, Lines,
      Stanzas, this one Sonnet to the stars should be miraculously reserved for
      such a starry fate&mdash;passing beatitude!
    </p>
    <p>
      As they walked silently across the meadow, Richard strove to remember the
      hour and the mood of mind in which he had composed the notable production.
      The stars were invoked, as seeing and foreseeing all, to tell him where
      then his love reclined, and so forth; Hesper was complacent enough to do
      so, and described her in a couplet&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Through sunset&rsquo;s amber see me shining fair,
     As her blue eyes shine through her golden hair.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And surely no words could be more prophetic. Here were two blue eyes and
      golden hair; and by some strange chance, that appeared like the working of
      a divine finger, she had become the possessor of the prophecy, she that
      was to fulfil it! The youth was too charged with emotion to speak.
      Doubtless the damsel had less to think of, or had some trifling burden on
      her conscience, for she seemed to grow embarrassed. At last she drew up
      her chin to look at her companion under the nodding brim of her hat (and
      the action gave her a charmingly freakish air), crying, &ldquo;But where are you
      going to? You are wet through. Let me thank you again; and, pray, leave
      me, and go home and change instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wet?&rdquo; replied the magnetic muser, with a voice of tender interest; &ldquo;not
      more than one foot, I hope. I will leave you while you dry your stockings
      in the sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this she could not withhold a shy laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, but you. You would try to get that silly book for me, and you are
      dripping wet. Are you not very uncomfortable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In all sincerity he assured her that he was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you really do not feel that you are wet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He really did not: and it was a fact that he spoke truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pursed her dewberry mouth in the most comical way, and her blue eyes
      lightened laughter out of the half-closed lids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot help it,&rdquo; she said, her mouth opening, and sounding harmonious
      bells of laughter in his ears. &ldquo;Pardon me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face took the same soft smiling curves in admiration of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to feel that you have been in the water, the very moment after!&rdquo; she
      musically interjected, seeing she was excused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; he said; and his own gravity then touched him to join a duet
      with her, which made them no longer feel strangers, and did the work of a
      month of intimacy. Better than sentiment, laughter opens the breast to
      love; opens the whole breast to his full quiver, instead of a corner here
      and there for a solitary arrow. Hail the occasion propitious, O British
      young! and laugh and treat love as an honest God, and dabble not with the
      sentimental rouge. These two laughed, and the souls of each cried out to
      other, &ldquo;It is I it is I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They laughed and forgot the cause of their laughter, and the sun dried his
      light river clothing, and they strolled toward the blackbird&rsquo;s copse, and
      stood near a stile in sight of the foam of the weir and the many-coloured
      rings of eddies streaming forth from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard&rsquo;s boat, meanwhile, had contrived to shoot the weir, and was
      swinging, bottom upward, broadside with the current down the rapid
      backwater.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you let it go?&rdquo; said the damsel, eying it curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be stopped,&rdquo; he replied, and could have added: &ldquo;What do I care
      for it now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His old life was whirled away with it, dead, drowned. His new life was
      with her, alive, divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flapped low the brim of her hat. &ldquo;You must really not come any
      farther,&rdquo; she softly said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you go, and not tell me who you are?&rdquo; he asked, growing bold as
      the fears of losing her came across him. &ldquo;And will you not tell me before
      you go&rdquo;&mdash;his face burned&mdash;&ldquo;how you came by that&mdash;that
      paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She chose to select the easier question for answer: &ldquo;You ought to know me;
      we have been introduced.&rdquo; Sweet was her winning off-hand affability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then who, in heaven&rsquo;s name, are you? Tell me! I never could have
      forgotten you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have, I think,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible that we could ever have met, and I forget you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember Belthorpe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belthorpe! Belthorpe!&rdquo; quoth Richard, as if he had to touch his brain to
      recollect there was such a place. &ldquo;Do you mean old Blaize&rsquo;s farm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am old Blaize&rsquo;s niece.&rdquo; She tripped him a soft curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magnetized youth gazed at her. By what magic was it that this divine
      sweet creature could be allied with that old churl!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what&mdash;what is your name?&rdquo; said his mouth, while his eyes added,
      &ldquo;O wonderful creature! How came you to enrich the earth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you forgot the Desboroughs of Dorset, too?&rdquo; she peered at him from a
      side-bend of the flapping brim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Desboroughs of Dorset?&rdquo; A light broke in on him. &ldquo;And have you grown
      to this? That little girl I saw there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew close to her to read the nearest features of the vision. She could
      no more laugh off the piercing fervour of his eyes. Her volubility
      fluttered under his deeply wistful look, and now neither voice was high,
      and they were mutually constrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;we are old acquaintances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard, with his eyes still intently fixed on her, returned, &ldquo;You are
      very beautiful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words slipped out. Perfect simplicity is unconsciously audacious. Her
      overpowering beauty struck his heart, and, like an instrument that is
      touched and answers to the touch, he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Desborough made an effort to trifle with this terrible directness;
      but his eyes would not be gainsaid, and checked her lips. She turned away
      from them, her bosom a little rebellious. Praise so passionately spoken,
      and by one who has been a damsel&rsquo;s first dream, dreamed of nightly many
      long nights, and clothed in the virgin silver of her thoughts in bud,
      praise from him is coin the heart cannot reject, if it would. She
      quickened her steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have offended you!&rdquo; said a mortally wounded voice across her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he should think so were too dreadful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, no! you would never offend me.&rdquo; She gave him her whole sweet face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why&mdash;why do you leave me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she hesitated, &ldquo;I must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You must not go. Why must you go? Do not go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I must,&rdquo; she said, pulling at the obnoxious broad brim of her hat;
      and, interpreting a pause he made for his assent to her rational resolve,
      shyly looking at him, she held her hand out, and said, &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; as if
      it were a natural thing to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hand was pure white&mdash;white and fragrant as the frosted blossom of
      a Maynight. It was the hand whose shadow, cast before, he had last night
      bent his head reverentially above, and kissed&mdash;resigning himself
      thereupon over to execution for payment of the penalty of such daring&mdash;by
      such bliss well rewarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the hand, and held it, gazing between her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she said again, as frankly as she could, and at the same time
      slightly compressing her fingers on his in token of adieu. It was a signal
      for his to close firmly upon hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, let me,&rdquo; she pleaded, her sweet brows suing in wrinkles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not go?&rdquo; Mechanically he drew the white hand nearer his thumping
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must,&rdquo; she faltered piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes! yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me. Do you wish to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question was a subtle one. A moment or two she did not answer, and
      then forswore herself, and said, Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you&mdash;you wish to go?&rdquo; He looked with quivering eyelids under
      hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fainter Yes responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish&mdash;wish to leave me?&rdquo; His breath went with the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hand became a closer prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once an alarming delicious shudder went through her frame. From him
      to her it coursed, and back from her to him. Forward and back love&rsquo;s
      electric messenger rushed from heart to heart, knocking at each, till it
      surged tumultuously against the bars of its prison, crying out for its
      mate. They stood trembling in unison, a lovely couple under these fair
      heavens of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he could get his voice it said, &ldquo;Will you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she had none to reply with, and could only mutely bend upward her
      gentle wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, farewell!&rdquo; he said, and, dropping his lips to the soft fair hand,
      kissed it, and hung his head, swinging away from her, ready for death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange, that now she was released she should linger by him. Strange, that
      his audacity, instead of the executioner, brought blushes and timid
      tenderness to his side, and the sweet words, &ldquo;You are not angry with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With you, O Beloved!&rdquo; cried his soul. &ldquo;And you forgive me, fair charity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it was rude of me to go without thanking you again,&rdquo; she said,
      and again proffered her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sweet heaven-bird shivered out his song above him. The gracious glory
      of heaven fell upon his soul. He touched her hand, not moving his eyes
      from her, nor speaking, and she, with a soft word of farewell, passed
      across the stile, and up the pathway through the dewy shades of the copse,
      and out of the arch of the light, away from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And away with her went the wild enchantment. He looked on barren air. But
      it was no more the world of yesterday. The marvellous splendours had sown
      seeds in him, ready to spring up and bloom at her gaze; and in his bosom
      now the vivid conjuration of her tones, her face, her shape, makes them
      leap and illumine him like fitful summer lightnings ghosts of the vanished
      sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing to tell him that he had been making love and declaring
      it with extraordinary rapidity; nor did he know it. Soft flushed cheeks!
      sweet mouth! strange sweet brows! eyes of softest fire! how could his ripe
      eyes behold you, and not plead to keep you? Nay, how could he let you go?
      And he seriously asked himself that question.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-morrow this place will have a memory&mdash;the river and the meadow,
      and the white falling weir: his heart will build a temple here; and the
      skylark will be its high-priest, and the old blackbird its glossy-gowned
      chorister, and there will be a sacred repast of dewberries. To-day the
      grass is grass: his heart is chased by phantoms and finds rest nowhere.
      Only when the most tender freshness of his flower comes across him does he
      taste a moment&rsquo;s calm; and no sooner does it come than it gives place to
      keen pangs of fear that she may not be his for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erelong he learns that her name is Lucy. Erelong he meets Ralph, and
      discovers that in a day he has distanced him by a sphere. He and Ralph and
      the curate of Lobourne join in their walks, and raise classical
      discussions on ladies&rsquo; hair, fingering a thousand delicious locks, from
      those of Cleopatra to the Borgia&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Fair! fair! all of them fair!&rdquo; sighs
      the melancholy curate, &ldquo;as are those women formed for our perdition! I
      think we have in this country what will match the Italian or the Greek.&rdquo;
       His mind flutters to Mrs. Doria, Richard blushes before the vision of
      Lucy, and Ralph, whose heroine&rsquo;s hair is a dark luxuriance, dissents, and
      claims a noble share in the slaughter of men for dark-haired Wonders. They
      have no mutual confidences, but they are singularly kind to each other,
      these three children of instinct.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lady Blandish, and others who professed an interest in the fortunes and
      future of the systematized youth, had occasionally mentioned names of
      families whose alliance according to apparent calculations, would not
      degrade his blood: and over these names, secretly preserved on an open
      leaf of the note-book, Sir Austin, as he neared the metropolis, distantly
      dropped his eye. There were names historic and names mushroomic; names
      that the Conqueror might have called in his muster-roll; names that had
      been, clearly, tossed into the upper stratum of civilized lifer by a
      millwheel or a merchant-stool. Against them the baronet had written M. or
      Po. or Pr.&mdash;signifying, Money, Position, Principles, favouring the
      latter with special brackets. The wisdom of a worldly man, which he could
      now and then adopt, determined him, before he commenced his round of
      visits, to consult and sound his solicitor and his physician thereanent;
      lawyers and doctors being the rats who know best the merits of a house,
      and on what sort of foundation it may be standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin entered the great city with a sad mind. The memory of his
      misfortune came upon him vividly, as if no years had intervened, and it
      were but yesterday that he found the letter telling him that he had no
      wife and his son no mother. He wandered on foot through the streets the
      first night of his arrival, looking strangely at the shops and shows and
      bustle of the world from which he had divorced himself; feeling as
      destitute as the poorest vagrant. He had almost forgotten how to find his
      way about, and came across his old mansion in his efforts to regain his
      hotel. The windows were alight&mdash;signs of merry life within. He stared
      at it from the shadow of the opposite side. It seemed to him he was a
      ghost gazing upon his living past. And then the phantom which had stood
      there mocking while he felt as other men&mdash;the phantom, now flesh and
      blood reality, seized and convulsed his heart, and filled its unforgiving
      crevices with bitter ironic venom. He remembered by the time reflection
      returned to him that it was Algernon, who had the house at his disposal,
      probably giving a card-party, or something of the sort. In the morning,
      too, he remembered that he had divorced the world to wed a System, and
      must be faithful to that exacting Spouse, who, now alone of things on
      earth, could fortify and recompense him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompson received his client with the dignity and emotion due to such
      a rent-roll and the unexpectedness of the honour. He was a thin stately
      man of law, garbed as one who gave audience to acred bishops, and carrying
      on his countenance the stamp of paternity to the parchment skins, and of a
      virtuous attachment to Port wine sufficient to increase his respectability
      in the eyes of moral Britain. After congratulating Sir Austin on the
      fortunate issue of two or three suits, and being assured that the
      baronet&rsquo;s business in town had no concern therewith, Mr. Thompson ventured
      to hope that the young heir was all his father could desire him to be, and
      heard with satisfaction that he was a pattern to the youth of the Age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A difficult time of life, Sir Austin!&rdquo; said the old lawyer, shaking his
      head. &ldquo;We must keep our eyes on them&mdash;keep awake! The mischief is
      done in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must take care to have seen where we planted, and that the root was
      sound, or the mischief will do itself in site of, or under the very
      spectacles of, supervision,&rdquo; said the baronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      His legal adviser murmured &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; as if that were his own idea,
      adding, &ldquo;It is my plan with Ripton, who has had the honour of an
      introduction to you, and a very pleasant time he spent with my young
      friend, whom he does not forget. Ripton follows the Law. He is articled to
      me, and will, I trust, succeed me worthily in your confidence. I bring him
      into town in the morning; I take him back at night. I think I may say that
      I am quite content with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; said Sir Austin, fixing his brows, &ldquo;that you can trace
      every act of his to its motive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lawyer bent forward and humbly requested that this might be
      repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you&rdquo;&mdash;Sir Austin held the same searching expression&mdash;&ldquo;do you
      establish yourself in a radiating centre of intuition: do you base your
      watchfulness on so thorough an acquaintance with his character, so perfect
      a knowledge of the instrument, that all its movements&mdash;even the
      eccentric ones&mdash;are anticipated by you, and provided for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The explanation was a little too long for the old lawyer to entreat
      another repetition. Winking with the painful deprecation of a deaf man,
      Mr. Thompson smiled urbanely, coughed conciliatingly, and said he was
      afraid he could not affirm that much, though he was happily enabled to say
      that Ripton had borne an extremely good character at school.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find,&rdquo; Sir Austin remarked, as sardonically he relaxed his inspecting
      pose and mien, &ldquo;there are fathers who are content to be simply obeyed. Now
      I require not only that my son should obey; I would have him guiltless of
      the impulse to gainsay my wishes&mdash;feeling me in him stronger than his
      undeveloped nature, up to a certain period, where my responsibility ends
      and his commences. Man is a self-acting machine. He cannot cease to be a
      machine; but, though self-acting, he may lose the powers of self-guidance,
      and in a wrong course his very vitalities hurry him to perdition. Young,
      he is an organism ripening to the set mechanic diurnal round, and while so
      he needs all the angels to hold watch over him that he grow straight and
      healthy, and fit for what machinal duties he may have to perform&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompson agitated his eyebrows dreadfully. He was utterly lost. He
      respected Sir Austin&rsquo;s estates too much to believe for a moment he was
      listening to downright folly. Yet how otherwise explain the fact of his
      excellent client being incomprehensible to him? For a middle-aged
      gentleman, and one who has been in the habit of advising and managing,
      will rarely have a notion of accusing his understanding; and Mr. Thompson
      had not the slightest notion of accusing his. But the baronet&rsquo;s
      condescension in coming thus to him, and speaking on the subject nearest
      his heart, might well affect him, and he quickly settled the case in
      favour of both parties, pronouncing mentally that his honoured client had
      a meaning, and so deep it was, so subtle, that no wonder he experienced
      difficulty in giving it fitly significant words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin elaborated his theory of the Organism and the Mechanism, for
      his lawyer&rsquo;s edification. At a recurrence of the word &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; Mr.
      Thompson caught him up:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I apprehended you! Oh, I agree with you, Sir Austin! entirely! Allow me
      to ring for my son Ripton. I think, if you condescend to examine him, you
      will say that regular habits, and a diet of nothing but law-reading&mdash;for
      other forms of literature I strictly interdict&mdash;have made him all
      that you instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompson&rsquo;s hand was on the bell. Sir Austin arrested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to see the lad at his occupation,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our old friend Ripton sat in a room apart with the confidential clerk, Mr.
      Beazley, a veteran of law, now little better than a document, looking
      already signed and sealed, and shortly to be delivered, who enjoined
      nothing from his pupil and companion save absolute silence, and sounded
      his praises to his father at the close of days when it had been rigidly
      observed&mdash;not caring, or considering, the finished dry old document
      that he was, under what kind of spell a turbulent commonplace youth could
      be charmed into stillness for six hours of the day. Ripton was supposed to
      be devoted to the study of Blackstone. A tome of the classic legal
      commentator lay extended outside his desk, under the partially lifted lid
      of which nestled the assiduous student&rsquo;s head&mdash;law being thus brought
      into direct contact with his brain-pan. The office-door opened, and he
      heard not; his name was called, and he remained equally moveless. His
      method of taking in Blackstone seemed absorbing as it was novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comparing notes, I daresay,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Thompson to Sir Austin. &ldquo;I
      call that study!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The confidential clerk rose, and bowed obsequious senility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it like this every day, Beazley?&rdquo; Mr. Thompson asked with parental
      pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; the old clerk replied, &ldquo;he is like this every day, sir. I could
      not ask more of a mouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin stepped forward to the desk. His proximity roused one of
      Ripton&rsquo;s senses, which blew a pall to the others. Down went the lid of the
      desk. Dismay, and the ardours of study, flashed together in Ripton&rsquo;s face.
      He slouched from his perch with the air of one who means rather to defend
      his position than welcome a superior, the right hand in his waistcoat
      pocket fumbling a key, the left catching at his vacant stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin put two fingers on the youth&rsquo;s shoulder, and said, leaning his
      head a little on one side, in a way habitual to him, &ldquo;I am glad to find my
      son&rsquo;s old comrade thus profitably occupied. I know what study is myself.
      But beware of prosecuting it too excitedly! Come! you must not be offended
      at our interruption; you will soon take up the thread again. Besides, you
      know, you must get accustomed to the visits of your client.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So condescending and kindly did this speech sound to Mr. Thompson, that,
      seeing Ripton still preserve his appearance of disorder and sneaking
      defiance, he thought fit to nod and frown at the youth, and desired him to
      inform the baronet what particular part of Blackstone he was absorbed in
      mastering at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton hesitated an instant, and blundered out, with dubious articulation,
      &ldquo;The Law of Gravelkind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Law?&rdquo; said Sir Austin, perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gravelkind,&rdquo; again rumbled Ripton&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin turned to Mr. Thompson for an explanation. The old lawyer was
      shaking his law-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Singular!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;He will make that mistake! What law, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton read his error in the sternly painful expression of his father&rsquo;s
      face, and corrected himself. &ldquo;Gavelkind, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Thompson, with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;Gravelkind, indeed!
      Gavelkind! An old Kentish&rdquo;&mdash;He was going to expound, but Sir Austin
      assured him he knew it, and a very absurd law it was, adding, &ldquo;I should
      like to look at your son&rsquo;s notes, or remarks on the judiciousness of that
      family arrangement, if he had any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were making notes, or referring to them, as we entered,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Thompson to the sucking lawyer; &ldquo;a very good plan, which I have always
      enjoined on you. Were you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton stammered that he was afraid he hid not any notes to show, worth
      seeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you doing then, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Making notes,&rdquo; muttered Ripton, looking incarnate subterfuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exhibit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton glanced at his desk and then at his father; at Sir Austin, and at
      the confidential clerk. He took out his key. It would not fit the hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exhibit!&rdquo; was peremptorily called again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his praiseworthy efforts to accommodate the keyhole, Ripton discovered
      that the desk was already unlocked. Mr. Thompson marched to it, and held
      the lid aloft. A book was lying open within, which Ripton immediately
      hustled among a mass of papers and tossed into a dark corner, not before
      the glimpse of a coloured frontispiece was caught by Sir Austin&rsquo;s eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baronet smiled, and said, &ldquo;You study Heraldry, too? Are you fond of
      the science?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton replied that he was very fond of it&mdash;extremely attached, and
      threw a further pile of papers into the dark corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notes had been less conspicuously placed, and the search for them was
      tedious and vain. Papers, not legal, or the fruits of study, were found,
      that made Mr. Thompson more intimate with the condition of his son&rsquo;s
      exchequer; nothing in the shape of a remark on the Law of Gavelkind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompson suggested to his son that they might be among those scraps he
      had thrown carelessly into the dark corner. Ripton, though he consented to
      inspect them, was positive they were not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have we here?&rdquo; said Mr. Thompson, seizing a neatly folded paper
      addressed to the Editor of a law publication, as Ripton brought them
      forth, one by one. Forthwith Mr. Thompson fixed his spectacles and read
      aloud:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;To the Editor of the &lsquo;Jurist.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&mdash;In your recent observations on the great case of Crim&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompson hem&rsquo;d! and stopped short, like a man who comes unexpectedly
      upon a snake in his path. Mr. Beazley&rsquo;s feet shuffled. Sir Austin changed
      the position of an arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on the other side, I think,&rdquo; gasped Ripton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompson confidently turned over, and intoned with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Absalom, the son of David, the little Jew usurer of Bond Court,
      Whitecross Gutters, for his introduction to Venus, I O U Five pounds, when
      I can pay.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             &ldquo;Signed: RIPTON THOMPSON.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Underneath this fictitious legal instrument was discreetly appended:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;(Mem. Document not binding.)&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause: an awful under-breath of sanctified wonderment and
      reproach passed round the office. Sir Austin assumed an attitude. Mr.
      Thompson shed a glance of severity on his confidential clerk, who parried
      by throwing up his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton, now fairly bewildered, stuffed another paper under his father&rsquo;s
      nose, hoping the outside perhaps would satisfy him: it was marked &ldquo;Legal
      Considerations.&rdquo; Mr. Thompson had no idea of sparing or shielding his son.
      In fact, like many men whose self-love is wounded by their offspring, he
      felt vindictive, and was ready to sacrifice him up to a certain point, for
      the good of both. He therefore opened the paper, expecting something worse
      than what he had hitherto seen, despite its formal heading, and he was not
      disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Legal Considerations&rdquo; related to the Case regarding, which Ripton had
      conceived it imperative upon him to address a letter to the Editor of the
      &ldquo;Jurist,&rdquo; and was indeed a great case, and an ancient; revived apparently
      for the special purpose of displaying the forensic abilities of the Junior
      Counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr. Ripton Thompson, whose assistance the
      Attorney-General, in his opening statement, congratulated himself on
      securing; a rather unusual thing, due probably to the eminence and renown
      of that youthful gentleman at the Bar of his country. So much was seen
      from the copy of a report purporting to be extracted from a newspaper, and
      prefixed to the Junior Counsel&rsquo;s remarks, or Legal Considerations, on the
      conduct of the Case, the admissibility and non-admissibility of certain
      evidence, and the ultimate decision of the judges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompson, senior, lifted the paper high, with the spirit of one
      prepared to do execution on the criminal, and in the voice of a
      town-crier, varied by a bitter accentuation and satiric sing-song tone,
      deliberately read:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;VULCAN v. MARS.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Attorney-General, assisted by Mr. Ripton Thompson, appeared on behalf
      of the Plaintiff. Mr. Serjeant Cupid, Q.C., and Mr. Capital Opportunity,
      for the Defendant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; snapped Mr. Thompson, senior, peering venom at the unfortunate
      Ripton over his spectacles, &ldquo;your notes are on that issue, sir! Thus you
      employ your time, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With another side-shot at the confidential clerk, who retired immediately
      behind a strong entrenchment of shrugs, Mr. Thompson was pushed by the
      devil of his rancour to continue reading:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Case is too well known to require more than a partial summary of
      particulars&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahem! we will skip the particulars, however partial,&rdquo; said Mr. Thompson.
      &ldquo;Ah!&mdash;what do you mean here, sir,&mdash;but enough! I think we may be
      excused your Legal Considerations on such a Case. This is how you employ
      your law-studies, sir! You put them to this purpose? Mr. Beazley! you will
      henceforward sit alone. I must have this young man under my own eye. Sir
      Austin! permit me to apologize to you for subjecting you to a scene so
      disagreeable. It was a father&rsquo;s duty not to spare him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompson wiped his forehead, as Brutes might have done after passing
      judgment on the scion of his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These papers,&rdquo; he went on, fluttering Ripton&rsquo;s precious lucubrations in a
      waving judicial hand, &ldquo;I shall retain. The day will come when he will
      regard them with shame. And it shall be his penance, his punishment, to do
      so! Stop!&rdquo; he cried, as Ripton was noiselessly shutting his desk, &ldquo;have
      you more of them, sir; of a similar description? Rout them out! Let us
      know you at your worst. What have you there&mdash;in that corner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton was understood to say he devoted that corner to old briefs on
      important cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompson thrust his trembling fingers among the old briefs, and turned
      over the volume Sir Austin had observed, but without much remarking it,
      for his suspicions had not risen to print.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Manual of Heraldry?&rdquo; the baronet politely, and it may be ironically,
      inquired, before it could well escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like it very much,&rdquo; said Ripton, clutching the book in dreadful
      torment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to see that you have our arms and crest correct.&rdquo; The baronet
      proffered a hand for the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Griffin between two Wheatsheaves,&rdquo; cried Ripton, still clutching it
      nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompson, without any notion of what he was doing, drew the book from
      Ripton&rsquo;s hold; whereupon the two seniors laid their grey heads together
      over the title-page. It set forth in attractive characters beside a
      coloured frontispiece, which embodied the promise displayed there, the
      entrancing adventures of Miss Random, a strange young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had there been a Black Hole within the area of those law regions to
      consign Ripton to there and then, or an Iron Rod handy to mortify his
      sinful flesh, Mr. Thompson would have used them. As it was, he contented
      himself by looking Black Holes and Iron Rods at the detected youth, who
      sat on his perch insensible to what might happen next, collapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompson cast the wicked creature down with a &ldquo;Pah!&rdquo; He, however, took
      her up again, and strode away with her. Sir Austin gave Ripton a
      forefinger, and kindly touched his head, saying, &ldquo;Good-bye, boy! At some
      future date Richard will be happy to see you at Raynham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly this was a great triumph to the System!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The conversation between solicitor and client was resumed.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; quoth Mr. Thompson, the moment he had ushered his client
      into his private room, &ldquo;that you will consent, Sir Austin, to see him and
      receive him again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; the baronet replied. &ldquo;Why not? This by no means astonishes
      me. When there is no longer danger to my son he will be welcome as he was
      before. He is a schoolboy. I knew it. I expected it. The results of your
      principle, Thompson!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the very worst books of that abominable class!&rdquo; exclaimed the old
      lawyer, opening at the coloured frontispiece, from which brazen Miss
      Random smiled bewitchingly out, as if she had no doubt of captivating Time
      and all his veterans on a fair field. &ldquo;Pah!&rdquo; he shut her to with the
      energy he would have given to the office of publicly slapping her face;
      &ldquo;from this day I diet him on bread and water&mdash;rescind his
      pocket-money!&mdash;How he could have got hold of such a book! How he&mdash;!
      And what ideas! Concealing them from me as he has done so cunningly! He
      trifles with vice! His mind is in a putrid state! I might have believed&mdash;I
      did believe&mdash;I might have gone on believing&mdash;my son Ripton to be
      a moral young man!&rdquo; The old lawyer interjected on the delusion of fathers,
      and sat down in a lamentable abstraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lad has come out!&rdquo; said Sir Austin. &ldquo;His adoption of the legal form
      is amusing. He trifles with vice, true: people newly initiated are as
      hardy as its intimates, and a young sinner&rsquo;s amusements will resemble
      those of a confirmed debauchee. The satiated, and the insatiate, appetite
      alike appeal to extremes. You are astonished at this revelation of your
      son&rsquo;s condition. I expected it; though assuredly, believe me, not this
      sudden and indisputable proof of it. But I knew that the seed was in him,
      and therefore I have not latterly invited him to Raynham. School, and the
      corruption there, will bear its fruits sooner or later. I could advise
      you, Thompson, what to do with him: it would be my plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompson murmured, like a true courtier, that he should esteem it an
      honour to be favoured with Sir Austin Feverel&rsquo;s advice: secretly resolute,
      like a true Briton, to follow his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him, then,&rdquo; continued the baronet, &ldquo;see vice in its nakedness. While
      he has yet some innocence, nauseate him! Vice, taken little by little,
      usurps gradually the whole creature. My counsel to you, Thompson, would
      be, to drag him through the sinks of town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompson began to blink again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I shall punish him, Sir Austin! Do not fear me, air. I have no
      tenderness for vice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not what is wanted, Thompson. You mistake me. He should be dealt
      with gently. Heavens! do you hope to make him hate vice by making him a
      martyr for its sake? You must descend from the pedestal of age to become
      his Mentor: cause him to see how certainly and pitilessly vice itself
      punishes: accompany him into its haunts&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over town?&rdquo; broke forth Mr. Thompson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over town,&rdquo; said the baronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And depend upon it,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that, until fathers act thoroughly up to
      their duty, we shall see the sights we see in great cities, and hear the
      tales we hear in little villages, with death and calamity in our homes,
      and a legacy of sorrow and shame to the generations to come. I do aver,&rdquo;
       he exclaimed, becoming excited, &ldquo;that, if it were not for the duty to my
      son, and the hope I cherish in him, I, seeing the accumulation of misery
      we are handing down to an innocent posterity&mdash;to whom, through our
      sin, the fresh breath of life will be foul&mdash;I&mdash;yes! I would hide
      my name! For whither are we tending? What home is pure absolutely? What
      cannot our doctors and lawyers tell us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompson acquiesced significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is to come of this?&rdquo; Sir Austin continued. &ldquo;When the sins of the
      fathers are multiplied by the sons, is not perdition the final sum of
      things? And is not life, the boon of heaven, growing to be the devil&rsquo;s
      game utterly? But for my son, I would hide my name. I would not bequeath
      it to be cursed by them that walk above my grave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was indeed a terrible view of existence. Mr. Thompson felt uneasy.
      There was a dignity in his client, an impressiveness in his speech, that
      silenced remonstrating reason and the cry of long years of comfortable
      respectability. Mr. Thompson went to church regularly; paid his rates and
      dues without overmuch, or at least more than common, grumbling. On the
      surface he was a good citizen, fond of his children, faithful to his wife,
      devoutly marching to a fair seat in heaven on a path paved by something
      better than a thousand a year. But here was a man sighting him from below
      the surface, and though it was an unfair, unaccustomed, not to say
      un-English, method of regarding one&rsquo;s fellow-man, Mr. Thompson was
      troubled by it. What though his client exaggerated? Facts were at the
      bottom of what he said. And he was acute&mdash;he had unmasked Ripton!
      Since Ripton&rsquo;s exposure he winced at a personal application in the text
      his client preached from. Possibly this was the secret source of part of
      his anger against that peccant youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompson shook his head, and, with dolefully puckered visage and a
      pitiable contraction of his shoulders, rose slowly up from his chair.
      Apparently he was about to speak, but he straightway turned and went
      meditatively to a side-recess in the room, whereof he opened a door, drew
      forth a tray and a decanter labelled Port, filled a glass for his client,
      deferentially invited him to partake of it; filled another glass for
      himself, and drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin never took wine before dinner. Thompson had looked as if he
      meant to speak: he waited for Thompson&rsquo;s words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompson saw that, as his client did not join him in his glass, the
      eloquence of that Porty reply was lost on his client.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having slowly ingurgitated and meditated upon this precious draught, and
      turned its flavour over and over with an aspect of potent Judicial wisdom
      (one might have thought that he was weighing mankind m the balance), the
      old lawyer heaved, and said, sharpening his lips over the admirable
      vintage, &ldquo;The world is in a very sad state, I fear, Sir Austin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His client gazed at him queerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that,&rdquo; Mr. Thompson added immediately, ill-concealing by his gaze the
      glowing intestinal congratulations going on within him, &ldquo;that is, I think
      you would say, Sir Austin&mdash;if I could but prevail upon you&mdash;a
      tolerably good character wine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s virtue somewhere, I see, Thompson!&rdquo; Sir Austin murmured, without
      disturbing his legal adviser&rsquo;s dimples.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lawyer sat down to finish his glass, saying, that such a wine was
      not to be had everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were then outwardly silent for a apace. Inwardly one of them was full
      of riot and jubilant uproar: as if the solemn fields of law were suddenly
      to be invaded and possessed by troops of Bacchanals: and to preserve a
      decently wretched physiognomy over it, and keep on terms with his
      companion, he had to grimace like a melancholy clown in a pantomime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompson brushed back his hair. The baronet was still expectant. Mr.
      Thompson sighed deeply, and emptied his glass. He combated the change that
      had come over him. He tried not to see Ruby. He tried to feel miserable,
      and it was not in him. He spoke, drawing what appropriate inspirations he
      could from his client&rsquo;s countenance, to show that they had views in
      common: &ldquo;Degenerating sadly, I fear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baronet nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;According to what my wine-merchants say,&rdquo; continued Mr. Thompson, &ldquo;there
      can be no doubt about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the grape, or the ground, or something,&rdquo; Mr. Thompson went on. &ldquo;All
      I can say is, our youngsters will have a bad look-out! In my opinion
      Government should be compelled to send out a Commission to inquire into
      the cause. To Englishmen it would be a public calamity. It surprises me&mdash;I
      hear men sit and talk despondently of this extraordinary disease of the
      vine, and not one of them seems to think it incumbent on him to act, and
      do his best to stop it.&rdquo; He fronted his client like a man who accuses an
      enormous public delinquency. &ldquo;Nobody makes a stir! The apathy of
      Englishmen will become proverbial. Pray, try it, Sir Austin! Pray, allow
      me. Such a wine cannot disagree at any hour. Do! I am allowanced two
      glasses three hours before dinner. Stomachic. I find it agree with me
      surprisingly: quite a new man. I suppose it will last our time. It must!
      What should we do? There&rsquo;s no Law possible without it. Not a lawyer of us
      could live. Ours is an occupation which dries the blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The scene with Ripton had unnerved him, the wine had renovated, and
      gratitude to the wine inspired his tongue. He thought that his client, of
      the whimsical mind, though undoubtedly correct moral views, had need of a
      glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that very wine&mdash;Sir Austin&mdash;I think I do not err in saying,
      that very wine your respected father, Sir Pylcher Feverel, used to taste
      whenever he came to consult my father, when I was a boy. And I remember
      one day being called in, and Sir Pylcher himself poured me out a glass. I
      wish I could call in Ripton now, and do the same. No! Leniency in such a
      case as that!&mdash;The wine would not hurt him&mdash;I doubt if there be
      much left for him to welcome his guests with. Ha! ha! Now if I could
      persuade you, Sir Austin, as you do not take wine before dinner, some day
      to favour me with your company at my little country cottage I have a wine
      there&mdash;the fellow to that&mdash;I think you would, I do think you
      would&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Thompson meant to say, he thought his client would arrive
      at something of a similar jocund contemplation of his fellows in their
      degeneracy that inspirited lawyers after potation, but condensed the
      sensual promise into &ldquo;highly approve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin speculated on his legal adviser with a sour mouth comically
      compressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It stood clear to him that Thompson before his Port, and Thompson after,
      were two different men. To indoctrinate him now was too late: it was
      perhaps the time to make the positive use of him he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pencilled on a handy slip of paper: &ldquo;Two prongs of a fork; the World
      stuck between them&mdash;Port and the Palate: &lsquo;Tis one which fails first&mdash;Down
      goes World;&rdquo; and again the hieroglyph&mdash;&ldquo;Port-spectacles.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I
      shall gladly accompany you this evening, Thompson,&rdquo; words that
      transfigured the delighted lawyer, and ensigned the skeleton of a great
      Aphorism to his pocket, there to gather flesh and form, with numberless
      others in a like condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to visit my lawyer,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I think I have been
      dealing with The World in epitome!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The rumour circulated that Sir Austin Feverel, the recluse of Raynham, the
      rank misogynist, the rich baronet, was in town, looking out a bride for
      his only son and uncorrupted heir. Doctor Benjamin Bairam was the
      excellent authority. Doctor Bairam had safely delivered Mrs. Deborah
      Gossip of this interesting bantling, which was forthwith dandled in dozens
      of feminine laps. Doctor Bairam could boast the first interview with the
      famous recluse. He had it from his own lips that the object of the baronet
      was to look out a bride for his only son and uncorrupted heir; &ldquo;and,&rdquo;
       added the doctor, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll be lucky who gets him.&rdquo; Which was interpreted to
      mean, that he would be a catch; the doctor probably intending to allude to
      certain extraordinary difficulties in the way of a choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A demand was made on the publisher of The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip for all his
      outstanding copies. Conventionalities were defied. A summer-shower of
      cards fell on the baronet&rsquo;s table.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had few male friends. He shunned the Clubs as nests of scandal. The
      cards he contemplated were mostly those of the sex, with the husband, if
      there was a husband, evidently dragged in for propriety&rsquo;s sake. He perused
      the cards and smiled. He knew their purpose. What terrible light Thompson
      and Bairam had thrown on some of them! Heavens! in what a state was the
      blood of this Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before commencing his campaign he called on two ancient intimates, Lord
      Heddon, and his distant cousin Darley Absworthy, both Members of
      Parliament, useful men, though gouty, who had sown in their time a fine
      crop of wild oats, and advocated the advantage of doing so, seeing that
      they did not fancy themselves the worse for it. He found one with an
      imbecile son and the other with consumptive daughters. &ldquo;So much,&rdquo; he wrote
      in the Note-book, &ldquo;for the Wild Oats theory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Darley was proud of his daughters&rsquo; white and pink skins. &ldquo;Beautiful
      complexions,&rdquo; he called them. The eldest was in the market, immensely
      admired. Sir Austin was introduced to her. She talked fluently and
      sweetly. A youth not on his guard, a simple school-boy youth, or even a
      man, might have fallen in love with her, she was so affable and fair.
      There was something poetic about her. And she was quite well, she said,
      the baronet frequently questioning her on that point. She intimated that
      she was robust; but towards the close of their conversation her hand would
      now and then travel to her side, and she breathed painfully an instant,
      saying, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it odd? Dora, Adela, and myself, we all feel the same queer
      sensation&mdash;about the heart, I think it is&mdash;after talking much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin nodded and blinked sadly, exclaiming to his soul, &ldquo;Wild oats!
      wild oats!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not ask permission to see Dora and Adela.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Heddon vehemently preached wild oats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all nonsense, Feverel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;about bringing up a lad out of the
      common way. He&rsquo;s all the better for a little racketing when he&rsquo;s green&mdash;feels
      his bone and muscle learns to know the world. He&rsquo;ll never be a man if he
      hasn&rsquo;t played at the old game one time in his life, and the earlier the
      better. I&rsquo;ve always found the best fellows were wildish once. I don&rsquo;t care
      what he does when he&rsquo;s a green-horn; besides, he&rsquo;s got an excuse for it
      then. You can&rsquo;t expect to have a man, if he doesn&rsquo;t take a man&rsquo;s food.
      You&rsquo;ll have a milksop. And, depend upon it, when he does break out he&rsquo;ll
      go to the devil, and nobody pities him. Look what those fellows the
      grocers, do when they get hold of a young&mdash;what d&rsquo;ye call &lsquo;em?&mdash;apprentice.
      They know the scoundrel was born with a sweet tooth. Well! they give him
      the run of the shop, and in a very short time he soberly deals out the
      goods, a devilish deal too wise to abstract a morsel even for the pleasure
      of stealing. I know you have contrary theories. You hold that the young
      grocer should have a soul above sugar. It won&rsquo;t do! Take my word for it,
      Feverel, it&rsquo;s a dangerous experiment, that of bringing up flesh and blood
      in harness. No colt will bear it, or he&rsquo;s a tame beast. And look you: take
      it on medical grounds. Early excesses the frame will recover from: late
      ones break the constitution. There&rsquo;s the case in a nutshell. How&rsquo;s your
      son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sound and well!&rdquo; replied Sir Austin. &ldquo;And yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lipscombe&rsquo;s always the same!&rdquo; Lord Heddon sighed peevishly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      quiet&mdash;that&rsquo;s one good thing; but there&rsquo;s no getting the country to
      take him, so I must give up hopes of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lipscombe entering the room just then, Sir Austin surveyed him, and
      was not astonished at the refusal of the country to take him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wild oats!&rdquo; he thought, as he contemplated the headless, degenerate,
      weedy issue and result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Darley Absworthy and Lord Heddon spoke of the marriage of their
      offspring as a matter of course. &ldquo;And if I were not a coward,&rdquo; Sir Austin
      confessed to himself, &ldquo;I should stand forth and forbid the banns! This
      universal ignorance of the inevitable consequence of sin is frightful! The
      wild oats plea is a torpedo that seems to have struck the world, and
      rendered it morally insensible.&rdquo; However, they silenced him. He was
      obliged to spare their feelings on a subject to him so deeply sacred. The
      healthful image of his noble boy rose before him, a triumphant living
      rejoinder to any hostile argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was content to remark to his doctor, that he thought the third
      generation of wild oats would be a pretty thin crop!
    </p>
    <p>
      Families against whom neither Thompson lawyer nor Bairam physician could
      recollect a progenitorial blot, either on the male or female side, were
      not numerous. &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; said the doctors &ldquo;you really must not be too
      exacting in these days, my dear Sir Austin. It is impossible to contest
      your principle, and you are doing mankind incalculable service in calling
      its attention to this the gravest of its duties: but as the stream of
      civilization progresses we must be a little taken in the lump, as it were.
      The world is, I can assure you&mdash;and I do not look only above the
      surface, you can believe&mdash;the world is awakening to the vital
      importance of the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; replied Sir Austin, &ldquo;if you had a pure-blood Arab barb would you
      cross him with a screw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly not,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then permit me to say, I shall employ every care to match my son
      according to his merits,&rdquo; Sir Austin returned. &ldquo;I trust the world is
      awakening, as you observe. I have been to my publisher, since my arrival
      in town, with a manuscript &lsquo;Proposal for a New System of Education of our
      British Youth,&rsquo; which may come in opportunely. I think I am entitled to
      speak on that subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;You will admit, Sir Austin, that, compared
      with continental nations&mdash;our neighbours, for instance&mdash;we shine
      to advantage, in morals, as in everything else. I hope you admit that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find no consolation in shining by comparison with a lower standard,&rdquo;
       said the baronet. &ldquo;If I compare the enlightenment of your views&mdash;for
      you admit my principle&mdash;with the obstinate incredulity of a country
      doctor&rsquo;s, who sees nothing of the world, you are hardly flattered, I
      presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Bairam would hardly be flattered at such a comparison, assuredly,
      he interjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added the baronet, &ldquo;the French make no pretences, and thereby
      escape one of the main penalties of hypocrisy. Whereas we!&mdash;but I am
      not their advocate, credit me. It is better, perhaps, to pay our homage to
      virtue. At least it delays the spread of entire corruptness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Bairam wished the baronet success, and diligently endeavoured to
      assist his search for a mate worthy of the pure-blood barb, by putting
      several mamas, whom he visited, on the alert.

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Away with Systems! Away with a corrupt World! Let us breathe the air of
      the Enchanted Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Golden lie the meadows: golden run the streams; red gold is on the
      pine-stems. The sun is coming down to earth, and walks the fields and the
      waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun is coming down to earth, and the fields and the waters shout to
      him golden shouts. He comes, and his heralds run before him, and touch the
      leaves of oaks and planes and beeches lucid green, and the pine-stems
      redder gold; leaving brightest footprints upon thickly-weeded banks, where
      the foxglove&rsquo;s last upper-bells incline, and bramble-shoots wander amid
      moist rich herbage. The plumes of the woodland are alight; and beyond
      them, over the open, &lsquo;tis a race with the long-thrown shadows; a race
      across the heaths and up the hills, till, at the farthest bourne of
      mounted eastern cloud, the heralds of the sun lay rosy fingers and rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweet are the shy recesses of the woodland. The ray treads softly there. A
      film athwart the pathway quivers many-hued against purple shade fragrant
      with warm pines, deep moss-beds, feathery ferns. The little brown squirrel
      drops tail, and leaps; the inmost bird is startled to a chance tuneless
      note. From silence into silence things move.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peeps of the revelling splendour above and around enliven the conscious
      full heart within. The flaming West, the crimson heights, shower their
      glories through voluminous leafage. But these are bowers where deep bliss
      dwells, imperial joy, that owes no fealty to yonder glories, in which the
      young lamb gambols and the spirits of men are glad. Descend, great
      Radiance! embrace creation with beneficent fire, and pass from us! You and
      the vice-regal light that succeeds to you, and all heavenly pageants, are
      the ministers and the slaves of the throbbing content within.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this is the home of the enchantment. Here, secluded from vexed shores,
      the prince and princess of the island meet: here like darkling
      nightingales they sit, and into eyes and ears and hands pour endless
      ever-fresh treasures of their souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roll on, grinding wheels of the world: cries of ships going down in a
      calm, groans of a System which will not know its rightful hour of
      exultation, complain to the universe. You are not heard here.
    </p>
    <p>
      He calls her by her name, Lucy: and she, blushing at her great boldness,
      has called him by his, Richard. Those two names are the key-notes of the
      wonderful harmonies the angels sing aloft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy! my beloved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Out in the world there, on the skirts of the woodland, a sheep-boy pipes
      to meditative eve on a penny-whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love&rsquo;s musical instrument is as old, and as poor: it has but two stops;
      and yet, you see, the cunning musician does thus much with it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Other speech they have little; light foam playing upon waves of feeling,
      and of feeling compact, that bursts only when the sweeping volume is too
      wild, and is no more than their sigh of tenderness spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps love played his tune so well because their natures had unblunted
      edges, and were keen for bliss, confiding in it as natural food. To
      gentlemen and ladies he fine-draws upon the viol, ravishingly; or blows
      into the mellow bassoon; or rouses the heroic ardours of the trumpet; or,
      it may be, commands the whole Orchestra for them. And they are pleased. He
      is still the cunning musician. They languish, and taste ecstasy: but it
      is, however sonorous, an earthly concert. For them the spheres move not to
      two notes. They have lost, or forfeited and never known, the first
      super-sensual spring of the ripe senses into passion; when they carry the
      soul with them, and have the privileges of spirits to walk disembodied,
      boundlessly to feel. Or one has it, and the other is a dead body. Ambrosia
      let them eat, and drink the nectar: here sit a couple to whom Love&rsquo;s
      simple bread and water is a finer feast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pipe, happy sheep-bop, Love! Irradiated angels, unfold your wings and lift
      your voices!
    </p>
    <p>
      They have out-flown philosophy. Their instinct has shot beyond the ken of
      science. They were made for their Eden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this divine gift was in store for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So runs the internal outcry of each, clasping each: it is their recurring
      refrain to the harmonies. How it illumined the years gone by and suffused
      the living Future!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You for me: I for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are born for each other!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They believe that the angels have been busy about them from their cradles.
      The celestial hosts have worthily striven to bring them together. And, O
      victory! O wonder! after toil and pain, and difficulties exceeding, the
      celestial hosts have succeeded!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we two sit who are written above as one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pipe, happy Love! pipe on to these dear innocents!
    </p>
    <p>
      The tide of colour has ebbed from the upper sky. In the West the sea of
      sunken fire draws back; and the stars leap forth, and tremble, and retire
      before the advancing moon, who slips the silver train of cloud from her
      shoulders, and, with her foot upon the pine-tops, surveys heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy, did you never dream of meeting me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Richard! yes; for I remembered you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy! and did you pray that we might meet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young as when she looked upon the lovers in Paradise, the fair Immortal
      journeys onward. Fronting her, it is not night but veiled day. Full half
      the sky is flushed. Not darkness, not day, but the nuptials of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own! my own for ever! You are pledged to me? Whisper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hears the delicious music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A soft beam travels to the fern-covert under the pinewood where they sit,
      and for answer he has her eyes turned to him an instant, timidly
      fluttering over the depths of his, and then downcast; for through her eyes
      her soul is naked to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy! my bride! my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The night-jar spins his dark monotony on the branch of the pine. The soft
      beam travels round them, and listens to their hearts. Their lips are
      locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pipe no more, Love, for a time! Pipe as you will you cannot express their
      first kiss; nothing of its sweetness, and of the sacredness of it nothing.
      St. Cecilia up aloft, before the silver organ-pipes of Paradise, pressing
      fingers upon all the notes of which Love is but one, from her you may hear
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Love is silent. Out in the world there, on the skirts of the woodland,
      the self-satisfied sheep-boy delivers a last complacent squint down the
      length of his penny-whistle, and, with a flourish correspondingly awry, he
      also marches into silence, hailed by supper. The woods are still. There is
      heard but the night-jar spinning on the pine-branch, circled by moonlight.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Enchanted Islands have not yet rooted out their old brood of dragons.
      Wherever there is romance, these monsters come by inimical attraction.
      Because the heavens are certainly propitious to true lovers, the beasts of
      the abysses are banded to destroy them, stimulated by innumerable sad
      victories; and every love-tale is an Epic Par of the upper and lower
      powers. I wish good fairies were a little more active. They seem to be
      cajoled into security by the happiness of their favourites; whereas the
      wicked are always alert, and circumspect. They let the little ones shut
      their eyes to fancy they are not seen, and then commence.
    </p>
    <p>
      These appointments and meetings, involving a start from the dinner-table
      at the hour of contemplative digestion and prime claret; the hour when the
      wise youth Adrian delighted to talk at his ease&mdash;to recline in dreamy
      consciousness that a work of good was going on inside him; these
      abstractions from his studies, excesses of gaiety, and glumness, heavings
      of the chest, and other odd signs, but mainly the disgusting behaviour of
      his pupil at the dinner-table, taught Adrian to understand, though the
      young gentleman was clever in excuses, that he had somehow learnt there
      was another half to the divided Apple of Creation, and had embarked upon
      the great voyage of discovery of the difference between the two halves.
      With his usual coolness Adrian debated whether he might be in the
      observatory or the practical stage of the voyage. For himself, as a man
      and a philosopher, Adrian had no objection to its being either; and he had
      only to consider which was temporarily most threatening to the ridiculous
      System he had to support. Richard&rsquo;s absence annoyed him. The youth was
      vivacious, and his enthusiasm good fun; and besides, when he left table,
      Adrian had to sit alone with Hippias and the Eighteenth Century, from both
      of whom he had extracted all the amusement that could be got, and he saw
      his digestion menaced by the society of two ruined stomachs, who bored him
      just when he loved himself most. Poor Hippias was now so reduced that he
      had profoundly to calculate whether a particular dish, or an extra-glass
      of wine, would have a bitter effect on him and be felt through the
      remainder of his years. He was in the habit of uttering his calculations
      half aloud, wherein the prophetic doubts of experience, and the succulent
      insinuations of appetite, contended hotly. It was horrible to hear him, so
      let us pardon Adrian for tempting him to a decision in favour of the
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy to take wine with you,&rdquo; Adrian would say, and Hippias would regard
      the decanter with a pained forehead, and put up the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink, nephew Hippy, and think of the doctor to-morrow!&rdquo; the Eighteenth
      Century cheerily ruffles her cap at him, and recommends her own practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this literary work!&rdquo; interjects Hippias, handling his glass of
      remorse. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what else it can be. You have no idea how anxious I
      feel. I have frightful dreams. I&rsquo;m perpetually anxious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; says Adrian, who enjoys the childish simplicity to which an
      absorbed study of his sensational existence has brought poor Hippias. &ldquo;No
      wonder. Ten years of Fairy Mythology! Could anyone hope to sleep in peace
      after that? As to your digestion, no one has a digestion who is in the
      doctor&rsquo;s hands. They prescribe from dogmas, and don&rsquo;t count on the system.
      They have cut you down from two bottles to two glasses. It&rsquo;s absurd. You
      can&rsquo;t sleep, because your system is crying out for what it&rsquo;s accustomed
      to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hippias sips his Madeira with a niggerdly confidence, but assures Adrian
      that he really should not like to venture on a bottle now: it would be
      rank madness to venture on a bottle now, he thinks. Last night only, after
      partaking, under protest, of that rich French dish, or was it the duck?&mdash;Adrian
      advised him to throw the blame on that vulgar bird.&mdash;Say the duck,
      then. Last night, he was no sooner stretched in bed, than he seemed to be
      of an enormous size all his limbs&mdash;his nose, his mouth, his toes&mdash;were
      elephantine! An elephant was a pigmy to him. And his hugeousness seemed to
      increase the instant he shut his eyes. He turned on this side; he turned
      on that. He lay on his back; he tried putting his face to the pillow; and
      he continued to swell. He wondered the room could hold him&mdash;he
      thought he must burst it&mdash;and absolutely lit a candle, and went to
      the looking-glass to see whether he was bearable.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Adrian and Richard were laughing uncontrollably. He had,
      however, a genial auditor in the Eighteenth Century, who declared it to be
      a new disease, not known in her day, and deserving investigation. She was
      happy to compare sensations with him, but hers were not of the complex
      order, and a potion soon righted her. In fact, her system appeared to be a
      debatable ground for aliment and medicine, on which the battle was fought,
      and, when over, she was none the worse, as she joyfully told Hippias.
      Never looked ploughman on prince, or village belle on Court Beauty, with
      half the envy poor nineteenth-century Hippias expended in his gaze on the
      Eighteenth. He was too serious to note much the laughter of the young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      This &lsquo;Tragedy of a Cooking-Apparatus,&rsquo; as Adrian designated the malady of
      Hippias, was repeated regularly ever evening. It was natural for any youth
      to escape as quick as he could from such a table of stomachs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian bore with his conduct considerately, until a letter from the
      baronet, describing the house and maternal System of a Mrs. Caroline
      Grandison, and the rough grain of hopefulness in her youngest daughter,
      spurred him to think of his duties, and see what was going on. He gave
      Richard half-an-hour&rsquo;s start, and then put on his hat to follow his own
      keen scent, leaving Hippias and the Eighteenth Century to piquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the lane near Belthorpe he met a maid of the farm not unknown to him,
      one Molly Davenport by name, a buxom lass, who, on seeing him, invoked her
      Good Gracious, the generic maid&rsquo;s familiar, and was instructed by
      reminiscences vivid, if ancient, to giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you looking for your young gentleman?&rdquo; Molly presently asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian glanced about the lane like a cool brigand, to see if the coast was
      clear, and replied to her, &ldquo;I am, miss. I want you to tell me about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear!&rdquo; said the buxom lass, &ldquo;was you coming for me to-night to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian rebuked her: for her bad grammar, apparently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause I can&rsquo;t stop out long to-night,&rdquo; Molly explained, taking the
      rebuke to refer altogether to her bad grammar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may go in when you please, miss. Is that any one coming? Come here in
      the shade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, get along!&rdquo; said Miss Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian spoke with resolution. &ldquo;Listen to me, Molly Davenport!&rdquo; He put a
      coin in her hand, which had a medical effect in calming her to attention.
      &ldquo;I want to know whether you have seen him at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Your young gentleman? I sh&rsquo;d think I did. I seen him to-night only.
      Ain&rsquo;t he grooved handsome. He&rsquo;s al&rsquo;ays about Beltharp now. It ain&rsquo;t to
      fire no more ricks. He&rsquo;s afire &lsquo;unself. Ain&rsquo;t you seen &lsquo;em together? He&rsquo;s
      after the missis&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian requested Miss Davenport to be respectful, and confine herself to
      particulars. This buxom lass then told him that her young missis and
      Adrian&rsquo;s young gentleman were a pretty couple, and met one another every
      night. The girl swore for their innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for Miss Lucy, she haven&rsquo;t a bit of art in her, nor have he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all nature, I suppose,&rdquo; said Adrian. &ldquo;How is it I don&rsquo;t see her
      at church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s Catholic, or some think,&rdquo; said Molly. &ldquo;Her father was, and a
      leftenant. She&rsquo;ve a Cross in her bedroom. She don&rsquo;t go to church. I see
      you there last Sunday a-lookin&rsquo; so solemn,&rdquo; and Molly stroked her hand
      down her chin to give it length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian insisted on her keeping to facts. It was dark, and in the dark he
      was indifferent to the striking contrasts suggested by the lass, but he
      wanted to hear facts, and he again bribed her to impart nothing but facts.
      Upon which she told him further, that her young lady was an innocent
      artless creature who had been to school upwards of three years with the
      nuns, and had a little money of her own, and was beautiful enough to be a
      lord&rsquo;s lady, and had been in love with Master Richard ever since she was a
      little girl. Molly had got from a friend of hers up at the Abbey, Mary
      Garner, the housemaid who cleaned Master Richard&rsquo;s room, a bit of paper
      once with the young gentleman&rsquo;s handwriting, and had given it to her Miss
      Lucy, and Miss Lucy had given her a gold sovereign for it&mdash;just for
      his handwriting! Miss Lucy did not seem happy at the farm, because of that
      young Tom, who was always leering at her, and to be sure she was quite a
      lady, and could play, and sing, and dress with the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looks like angels in her nightgown!&rdquo; Molly wound up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment she ran up close, and speaking for the first time as if
      there were a distinction of position between them, petitioned: &ldquo;Mr.
      Harley! you won&rsquo;t go for doin&rsquo; any harm to &lsquo;em &lsquo;cause of what I said, will
      you now? Do say you won&rsquo;t now, Mr. Harley! She is good, though she&rsquo;s a
      Catholic. She was kind to me when I was ill, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have her
      crossed&mdash;I&rsquo;d rather be showed up myself, I would!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wise youth gave no positive promise to Molly, and she had to read his
      consent in a relaxation of his austerity. The noise of a lumbering foot
      plodding down the lane caused her to be abruptly dismissed. Molly took to
      flight, the lumbering foot accelerated its pace, and the pastoral appeal
      to her flying skirts was heard&mdash;&ldquo;Moll! you theyre! It be I&mdash;Bantam!&rdquo;
       But the sprightly Silvia would not stop to his wooing, and Adrian turned
      away laughing at these Arcadians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian was a lazy dragon. All he did for the present was to hint and
      tease. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Inevitable!&rdquo; he said, and asked himself why he should
      seek to arrest it. He had no faith in the System. Heavy Benson had. Benson
      of the slow thick-lidded antediluvian eye and loose-crumpled skin; Benson,
      the Saurian, the woman-hater; Benson was wide awake. A sort of rivalry
      existed between the wise youth and heavy Benson. The fidelity of the
      latter dependant had moved the baronet to commit to him a portion of the
      management of the Raynham estate, and this Adrian did not like. No one who
      aspires to the honourable office of leading another by the nose can
      tolerate a party in his ambition. Benson&rsquo;s surly instinct told him he was
      in the wise youth&rsquo;s way, and he resolved to give his master a striking
      proof of his superior faithfulness. For some weeks the Saurian eye had
      been on the two secret creatures. Heavy Benson saw letters come and go in
      the day, and now the young gentleman was off and out every night, and
      seemed to be on wings. Benson knew whither he went, and the object he went
      for. It was a woman&mdash;that was enough. The Saurian eye had actually
      seen the sinful thing lure the hope of Raynham into the shades. He
      composed several epistles of warning to the baronet of the work that was
      going on; but before sending one he wished to record a little of their
      guilty conversation; and for this purpose the faithful fellow trotted over
      the dews to eavesdrop, and thereby aroused the good fairy, in the person
      of Tom Bakewell, the sole confidant of Richard&rsquo;s state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom said to his young master, &ldquo;Do you know what, sir? You be watched!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard, in a fury, bade him name the wretch, and Tom hung his arms, and
      aped the respectable protrusion of the butler&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s he, is it?&rdquo; cried Richard. &ldquo;He shall rue it, Tom. If I find him near
      me when we&rsquo;re together he shall never forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hit too hard, sir,&rdquo; Tom suggested. &ldquo;You hit mortal hard when you&rsquo;re
      in earnest, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard averred he would forgive anything but that, and told Tom to be
      within hail to-morrow night&mdash;he knew where. By the hour of the
      appointment it was out of the lover&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Blandish dined that evening at Raynham, by Adrian&rsquo;s pointed
      invitation. According to custom, Richard started up and off, with few
      excuses. The lady exhibited no surprise. She and Adrian likewise strolled
      forth to enjoy the air of the Summer night. They had no intention of
      spying. Still they may have thought, by meeting Richard and his inamorata,
      there was a chance of laying a foundation of ridicule to sap the passion.
      They may have thought so&mdash;they were on no spoken understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen the little girl,&rdquo; said Lady Blandish. &ldquo;She is pretty&mdash;she
      would be telling if she were well set up. She speaks well. How absurd it
      is of that class to educate their women above their station! The child is
      really too good for a farmer. I noticed her before I knew of this; she has
      enviable hair. I suppose she doesn&rsquo;t paint her eyelids. Just the sort of
      person to take a young man. I thought there was something wrong. I
      received, the day before yesterday, an impassioned poem evidently not
      intended for me. My hair was gold. My meeting him was foretold. My eyes
      were homes of light fringed with night. I sent it back, correcting the
      colours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which was death to the rhymes,&rdquo; said Adrian. &ldquo;I saw her this morning. The
      boy hasn&rsquo;t bad taste. As you say, she is too good for a farmer. Such a
      spark would explode any System. She slightly affected mine. The Huron is
      stark mad about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we must positively write and tell his father,&rdquo; said Lady Blandish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wise youth did not see why they should exaggerate a trifle. The lady
      said she would have an interview with Richard, and then write, as it was
      her duty to do. Adrian shrugged, and was for going into the scientific
      explanation of Richard&rsquo;s conduct, in which the lady had to discourage him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy!&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;I am really sorry for him. I hope he will not
      feel it too strongly. They feel strongly, father and son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And select wisely,&rdquo; Adrian added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo; said Lady Blandish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their talk was then of the dulness of neighbouring county people, about
      whom, it seemed, there was little or no scandal afloat: of the lady&rsquo;s loss
      of the season in town, which she professed not to regret, though she
      complained of her general weariness: of whether Mr. Morton of Poer Hall
      would propose to Mrs. Doria, and of the probable despair of the hapless
      curate of Lobourne; and other gossip, partly in French.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rounded the lake, and got upon the road through the park to Lobourne.
      The moon had risen. The atmosphere was warm and pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a lover&rsquo;s night,&rdquo; said Lady Blandish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, who have none to love pity me!&rdquo; The wise youth attempted a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And never will have,&rdquo; said Lady Blandish, curtly. &ldquo;You buy your loves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian protested. However, he did not plead verbally against the
      impeachment, though the lady&rsquo;s decisive insight astonished him. He began
      to respect her, relishing her exquisite contempt, and he reflected that
      widows could be terrible creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hoped to be a little sentimental with Lady Blandish, knowing her
      romantic. This mixture of the harshest common sense and an air of &ldquo;I know
      you men,&rdquo; with romance and refined temperament, subdued the wise youth
      more than a positive accusation supported by witnesses would have done. He
      looked at the lady. Her face was raised to the moon. She knew nothing&mdash;she
      had simply spoken from the fulness of her human knowledge, and had
      forgotten her words. Perhaps, after all, her admiration, or whatever
      feeling it was, for the baronet, was sincere, and really the longing for a
      virtuous man. Perhaps she had tried the opposite set pretty much. Adrian
      shrugged. Whenever the wise youth encountered a mental difficulty he
      instinctively lifted his shoulders to equal altitudes, to show that he had
      no doubt there was a balance in the case&mdash;plenty to be said on both
      sides, which was the same to him as a definite solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      At their tryst in the wood, abutting on Raynham Park, wrapped in
      themselves, piped to by tireless Love, Richard and Lucy sat, toying with
      eternal moments. How they seem as if they would never end! What mere
      sparks they are when they have died out! And how in the distance of time
      they revive, and extend, and glow, and make us think them full the half,
      and the best of the fire, of our lives!
    </p>
    <p>
      With the onward flow of intimacy, the two happy lovers ceased to be so shy
      of common themes, and their speech did not reject all as dross that was
      not pure gold of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy was very inquisitive about everything and everybody at Raynham.
      Whoever had been about Richard since his birth, she must know the history
      of, and he for a kiss will do her bidding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus goes the tender duet:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should know my cousin Austin, Lucy.&mdash;Darling! Beloved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own! Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should know my cousin Austin. You shall know him. He would take to
      you best of them all, and you to him. He is in the tropics now, looking
      out a place&mdash;it&rsquo;s a secret&mdash;for poor English working-men to
      emigrate to and found a colony in that part of the world:&mdash;my white
      angel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is such a noble fellow! Nobody here understands him but me. Isn&rsquo;t it
      strange? Since I met you I love him better! That&rsquo;s because I love all
      that&rsquo;s good and noble better now&mdash;Beautiful! I love&mdash;I love
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think I&rsquo;ve determined, Lucy? If my father&mdash;but no! my
      father does love me.&mdash;No! he will not; and we will be happy together
      here. And I will win my way with you. And whatever I win will be yours;
      for it will be owing to you. I feel as if I had no strength but yours&mdash;none!
      and you make me&mdash;O Lucy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice ebbs. Presently Lucy murmurs&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Richard! I feel so afraid of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He loves me, and will love you, Lucy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am so poor and humble, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one I have ever seen is like you, Lucy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so, because you&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love me,&rdquo; comes the blushing whisper, and the duet gives place to dumb
      variations, performed equally in concert.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are fond of the knights, Lucy. Austin is as brave as any of them.&mdash;My
      own bride! Oh, how I adore you! When you are gone, I could fall upon the
      grass you tread upon, and kiss it. My breast feels empty of my heart&mdash;Lucy!
      if we lived in those days, I should have been a knight, and have won
      honour and glory for you. Oh! one can do nothing now. My lady-love! My
      lady-love!&mdash;A tear?&mdash;Lucy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest! Ah, Richard! I am not a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who dares say that? Not a lady&mdash;the angel I love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think, Richard, who I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My beautiful! I think that God made you, and has given you to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes fill with tears, and, as she lifts them heavenward to thank her
      God, the light of heaven strikes on them, and she is so radiant in her
      pure beauty that the limbs of the young man tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy! O heavenly spirit! Lucy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tenderly her lips part&mdash;&ldquo;I do not weep for sorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The big bright drops lighten, and roll down, imaged in his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      They lean together&mdash;shadows of ineffable tenderness playing on their
      thrilled cheeks and brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifts her hand, and presses his mouth to it. She has seen little of
      mankind, but her soul tells her this one is different from others, and at
      the thought, in her great joy, tears must come fast, or her heart will
      break&mdash;tears of boundless thanksgiving. And he, gazing on those soft,
      ray-illumined, dark-edged eyes, and the grace of her loose falling
      tresses, feels a scarce-sufferable holy fire streaming through his
      members.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is long ere they speak in open tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O happy day when we met!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What says the voice of one, the soul of the other echoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O glorious heaven looking down on us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their souls are joined, are made one for evermore beneath that bending
      benediction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O eternity of bliss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the diviner mood passes, and they drop to earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy! come with me to-night, and look at the place where you are some day
      to live. Come, and I will row you on the lake. You remember what you said
      in your letter that you dreamt?&mdash;that we were floating over the
      shadow of the Abbey to the nuns at work by torchlight felling the cypress,
      and they handed us each a sprig. Why, darling, it was the best omen in the
      world, their felling the old trees. And you write such lovely letters. So
      pure and sweet they are. I love the nuns for having taught you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Richard! See! we forget! Ah!&rdquo; she lifts up her face pleadingly, as to
      plead against herself, &ldquo;even if your father forgives my birth, he will not
      my religion. And, dearest, though I would die for you I cannot change it.
      It would seem that I was denying God; and&mdash;oh! it would make me
      ashamed of my love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear nothing!&rdquo; He winds her about with his arm. &ldquo;Come! He will love us
      both, and love you the more for being faithful to your father&rsquo;s creed. You
      don&rsquo;t know him, Lucy. He seems harsh and stern&mdash;he is full of
      kindness and love. He isn&rsquo;t at all a bigot. And besides, when he hears
      what the nuns have done for you, won&rsquo;t he thank them, as I do? And&mdash;oh!
      I must speak to him soon, and you must be prepared to see him soon, for I
      cannot bear your remaining at Belthorpe, like a jewel in a sty. Mind! I&rsquo;m
      not saying a word against your uncle. I declare I love everybody and
      everything that sees you and touches you. Stay! it is a wonder how you
      could have grown there. But you were not born there, and your father had
      good blood. Desborough!&mdash;here was a Colonel Desborough&mdash;never
      mind! Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dreads to. She begs not to. She is drawn away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woods are silent, and then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What think you of that for a pretty pastoral?&rdquo; says a very different
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian reclined against a pine overlooking the fern-covert. Lady Blandish
      was recumbent upon the brown pine-droppings, gazing through a vista of the
      lower greenwood which opened out upon the moon-lighted valley, her hands
      clasped round one knee, her features almost stern in their set hard
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had heard, by involuntarily overhearing about as much as may be heard
      in such positions, a luminous word or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady did not answer. A movement among the ferns attracted Adrian, and
      he stepped down the decline across the pine-roots to behold heavy Benson
      below; shaking fern-seed and spidery substances off his crumpled skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Mr. Hadrian?&rdquo; called Benson, starting, as he puffed, and
      exercised his handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you, Benson, who have had the audacity to spy upon these
      Mysteries?&rdquo; Adrian called back, and coming close to him, added, &ldquo;You look
      as if you had just been well thrashed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it dreadful, sir?&rdquo; snuffled Benson. &ldquo;And his father in ignorance,
      Mr. Hadrian!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall know, Benson! He shall know how, you have endangered your
      valuable skin in his service. If Mr. Richard had found you there just now
      I wouldn&rsquo;t answer for the consequences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; Benson spitefully retorted. &ldquo;This won&rsquo;t go on; Mr. Hadrian. It
      shan&rsquo;t, sir. It will be put a stop to tomorrow, sir. I call it corruption
      of a young gentleman like him, and harlotry, sir, I call it. I&rsquo;d have
      every jade flogged that made a young innocent gentleman go on like that,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, why didn&rsquo;t you stop it yourself, Benson? Ah, I see! you waited&mdash;what?
      This is not the first time you have been attendant on Apollo and Miss
      Dryope? You have written to headquarters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did my duty, Mr. Hadrian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wise youth returned to Lady Blandish, and informed her of Benson&rsquo;s
      zeal. The lady&rsquo;s eyes flashed. &ldquo;I hope Richard will treat him as he
      deserves,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we home?&rdquo; Adrian inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do me a favour;&rdquo; the lady replied. &ldquo;Get my carriage sent round to meet me
      at the park-gates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to be alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian bowed and left her. She was still sitting with her hands clasped
      round one knee, gazing towards the dim ray-strewn valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An odd creature!&rdquo; muttered the wise youth. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s as odd as any of them.
      She ought to be a Feverel. I suppose she&rsquo;s graduating for it. Hang that
      confounded old ass of a Benson! He has had the impudence to steal a march
      on me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shadow of the cypress was lessening on the lake. The moon was climbing
      high. As Richard rowed the boat, Lucy, sang to him softly. She sang first
      a fresh little French song, reminding him of a day when she had been asked
      to sing to him before, and he did not care to hear. &ldquo;Did I live?&rdquo; he
      thinks. Then she sang to him a bit of one of those majestic old Gregorian
      chants, that, wherever you may hear them, seem to build up cathedral walls
      about you. The young man dropped the sculls. The strange solemn notes gave
      a religions tone to his love, and wafted him into the knightly ages and
      the reverential heart of chivalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hanging between two heavens on the lake: floating to her voice: the moon
      stepping over and through white shoal&rsquo;s of soft high clouds above and
      below: floating to her void&mdash;no other breath abroad! His soul went
      out of his body as he listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      They must part. He rows her gently shoreward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never was so happy as to-night,&rdquo; she murmurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, my Lucy. The lights of the old place are on the lake. Look where
      you are to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is your room, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He points it out to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Richard! that I were one of the women who wait on you! I should ask
      nothing more. How happy she must be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling angel-love. You shall be happy; but all shall wait on you, and
      I foremost, Lucy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest! may I hope for a letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By eleven to-morrow. And I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you will have mine, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom shall wait far it. A long one, mind! Did you like my last song?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pats her hand quietly against her bosom, and he knows where it rests.
      O love! O heaven!
    </p>
    <p>
      They are aroused by the harsh grating of the bow of the boat against the
      shingle. He jumps out, and lifts her ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See!&rdquo; she says, as the blush of his embrace subsides&mdash;&ldquo;See!&rdquo; and
      prettily she mimics awe and feels it a little, &ldquo;the cypress does point
      towards us. O Richard! it does!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he, looking at her rather than at the cypress, delighting in her arch
      grave ways&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s hardly any shadow at all, Lucy. She mustn&rsquo;t dream, my
      darling! or dream only of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest! but I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, Lucy! The letter in the morning, and you at night. O happy
      to-morrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be sure to be there, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am not dead, Lucy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Richard! pray, pray do not speak of that. I shall not survive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us pray, Lucy, to die together, when we are to die. Death or life,
      with you! Who is it yonder? I see some one&mdash;is it Tom? It&rsquo;s Adrian!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it Mr. Harley?&rdquo; The fair girl shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dares he come here!&rdquo; cried Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure of Adrian, instead of advancing, discreetly circled the lake.
      They were stealing away when he called. His call was repeated. Lucy
      entreated Richard to go to him; but the young man preferred to summon his
      attendant, Tom, from within hail, and send him to know what was wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he have seen me? Will he have known me?&rdquo; whispered Lucy,
      tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he does, love?&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if he does, dearest&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, but I feel such a
      presentiment. You have not spoken of him to-night, Richard. Is he good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good?&rdquo; Richard clutched her hand for the innocent maiden phrase. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      very fond of eating; that&rsquo;s all I know of Adrian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hand was at his lips when Tom returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Adrian wishes particular to speak to you, sir,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do go to him, dearest! Do go!&rdquo; Lucy begs him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how I hate Adrian!&rdquo; The young man grinds his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do go!&rdquo; Lucy urges him. &ldquo;Tom&mdash;good Tom&mdash;will see me home.
      To-morrow, dear love! To-morrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish to part from me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, unkind! but you must not come with me now. It may be news of
      importance, dearest. Think, Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom! go back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the imperious command the well-drilled Tom strides off a dozen paces,
      and sees nothing. Then the precious charge is confided to him. A heart is
      cut in twain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard made his way to Adrian. &ldquo;What is it you want with me, Adrian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we seconds, or principals, O fiery one?&rdquo; was Adrian&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;I want
      nothing with you, except to know whether you have seen Benson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where should I see Benson? What do I know of Benson&rsquo;s doings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not&mdash;such a secret old fist as he is! I want some one to
      tell him to order Lady Blandish&rsquo;s carriage to be sent round to the
      park-gates. I thought he might be round your way over there&mdash;I came
      upon him accidentally just now in Abbey-wood. What&rsquo;s the matter, boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw him there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hunting Diana, I suppose. He thinks she&rsquo;s not so chaste as they say,&rdquo;
       continued Adrian. &ldquo;Are you going to knock down that tree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard had turned to the cypress, and was tugging at the tough wood. He
      left it and went to an ash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll spoil that weeper,&rdquo; Adrian cried. &ldquo;Down she comes! But good-night,
      Ricky. If you see Benson mind you tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doomed Benson following his burly shadow hove in sight on the white road
      while Adrian spoke. The wise youth chuckled and strolled round the lake,
      glancing over his shoulder every now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not long before he heard a bellow for help&mdash;the roar of a
      dragon in his throes. Adrian placidly sat down on the grass, and fixed his
      eyes on the water. There, as the roar was being repeated amid horrid
      resounding echoes, the wise youth mused in this wise&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Fates are Jews with us when they delay a punishment,&rsquo; says The
      Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip, or words to that effect. The heavens evidently love
      Benson, seeing that he gets his punishment on the spot. Master Ricky is a
      peppery young man. He gets it from the apt Gruffudh. I rather believe in
      race. What a noise that old ruffian makes! He&rsquo;ll require poulticing with
      The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip. We shall have a message to-morrow, and a hubbub, and
      perhaps all go to town, which won&rsquo;t be bad for one who&rsquo;s been a prey to
      all the desires born of dulness. Benson howls: there&rsquo;s life in the old dog
      yet! He bays the moon. Look at her. She doesn&rsquo;t care. It&rsquo;s the same to her
      whether we coo like turtle-doves or roar like twenty lions. How complacent
      she looks! And yet she has dust as much sympathy for Benson as for Cupid.
      She would smile on if both were being birched. Was that a raven or Benson?
      He howls no more. It sounds guttural: frog-like&mdash;something between
      the brek-kek-kek and the hoarse raven&rsquo;s croak. The fellow&rsquo;ll be killing
      him. It&rsquo;s time to go to the rescue. A deliverer gets more honour by coming
      in at the last gasp than if he forestalled catastrophe.&mdash;Ho, there,
      what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the wise youth rose, and leisurely trotted to the scene of
      battle, where stood St. George puffing over the prostrate Dragon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holloa, Ricky! is it you?&rdquo; said Adrian. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Whom have we here?&mdash;Benson,
      as I live!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make this beast get up,&rdquo; Richard returned, breathing hard, and shaking
      his great ash-branch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems incapable, my dear boy. What have you been up to?&mdash;Benson!
      Benson!&mdash;I say, Ricky, this looks bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s shamming!&rdquo; Richard clamoured like a savage. &ldquo;Spy upon me, will he? I
      tell you, he&rsquo;s shamming. He hasn&rsquo;t had half enough. Nothing&rsquo;s too bad for
      a spy. Let him getup!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insatiate youth! do throw away that enormous weapon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has written to my father,&rdquo; Richard shouted. &ldquo;The miserable spy! Let
      him get up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ooogh? I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; huskily groaned Benson. &ldquo;Mr. Hadrian, you&rsquo;re a witness&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      my back!&rdquo;&mdash;Cavernous noises took up the tale of his maltreatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay you love your back better than any part of your body now,&rdquo;
       Adrian muttered. &ldquo;Come, Benson! be a man. Mr. Richard has thrown away the
      stick. Come, and get off home, and let&rsquo;s see the extent of the damage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ooogh! he&rsquo;s a devil! Mr. Hadrian, sir, he&rsquo;s a devil!&rdquo; groaned Benson,
      turning half over in the road to ease his aches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian caught hold of Benson&rsquo;s collar and lifted him to a sitting posture.
      He then had a glimpse of what his hopeful pupil&rsquo;s hand could do in wrath.
      The wretched butler&rsquo;s coat was slit and welted; his hat knocked in; his
      flabby spirit so broken that he started and trembled if his pitiless
      executioner stirred a foot. Richard stood over him, grasping his great
      stick; no dawn of mercy for Benson in any corner of his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benson screwed his neck round to look up at him, and immediately gasped,
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t get up! I won&rsquo;t! He&rsquo;s ready to murder me again!&mdash;Mr.
      Hadrian! if you stand by and see it, you&rsquo;re liable to the law, sir&mdash;I
      won&rsquo;t get up while he&rsquo;s near.&rdquo; No persuasion could induce Benson to try
      his legs while his executioner stood by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian took Richard aside: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve almost killed the poor devil, Ricky.
      You must be satisfied with that. Look at his face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The coward bobbed while I struck&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;I marked his back. He
      ducked. I told him he was getting it worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At so civilized piece of savagery, Adrian opened his mouth wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you really? I admire that. You told him he was getting it worse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian opened his mouth again to shake another roll of laughter out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Excalibur has done his word. Pitch him into the lake.
      And see&mdash;here comes the Blandish. You can&rsquo;t be at it again before a
      woman. Go and meet her, and tell her the noise was an ox being
      slaughtered. Or say Argus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a whirr that made all Benson&rsquo;s bruises moan and quiver, the great
      ash-branch shot aloft, and Richard swung off to intercept Lady Blandish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian got Benson on his feet. The heavy butler was disposed to summon all
      the commiseration he could feel for his bruised flesh. Every half-step he
      attempted was like a dislocation. His groans and grunts were frightful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much did that hat cost, Benson?&rdquo; said Adrian, as he put it on his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A five-and-twenty shilling beaver, Mr. Hadrian!&rdquo; Benson caressed its
      injuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cheapest policy of insurance I remember to have heard of!&rdquo; said
      Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benson staggered, moaning at intervals to his cruel comforter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a devil, Mr. Hadrian! He&rsquo;s a devil, sir, I do believe, sir. Ooogh!
      he&rsquo;s a devil!&mdash;I can&rsquo;t move, Mr. Hadrian. I must be fetched. And Dr.
      Clifford must be sent for, sir. I shall never be fit for work again. I
      haven&rsquo;t a sound bone in my body, Mr. Hadrian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Benson, this comes of your declaring war upon Venus. I hope the
      maids will nurse you properly. Let me see: you are friends with the
      housekeeper, aren&rsquo;t you? All depends upon that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only a faithful servant, Mr. Hadrian,&rdquo; the miserable butler snarled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve got no friend but your bed. Get to it as quick as possible,
      Benson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t move.&rdquo; Benson made a resolute halt. &ldquo;I must be fetched,&rdquo; he
      whinnied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame to ask me to move, Mr. Hadrian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will admit that you are heavy, Benson,&rdquo; said Adrian, &ldquo;so I can&rsquo;t
      carry you. However, I see Mr. Richard is very kindly returning to help
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words heavy Benson instantly found his legs, and shambled on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Blandish met Richard in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been horribly frightened,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Tell me, what was the
      meaning of those cries I heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only some one doing justice on a spy,&rdquo; said Richard, and the lady smiled,
      and looked on him fondly, and put her hand through his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that all? I should have done it myself if I had been a man. Kiss me.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      By twelve o&rsquo;clock at noon next day the inhabitants of Raynham Abbey knew
      that Berry, the baronet&rsquo;s man, had arrived post-haste from town, with
      orders to conduct Mr. Richard thither, and that Mr. Richard had refused to
      go, had sworn he would not, defied his father, and despatched Berry to the
      Shades. Berry was all that Benson was not. Whereas Benson hated woman,
      Berry admired her warmly. Second to his own stately person, woman occupied
      his reflections, and commanded his homage. Berry was of majestic port, and
      used dictionary words. Among the maids of Raynham his conscious calves
      produced all the discord and the frenzy those adornments seem destined to
      create in tender bosoms. He had, moreover, the reputation of having
      suffered for the sex; which assisted his object in inducing the sex to
      suffer for him. What with his calves, and his dictionary words, and the
      attractive halo of the mysterious vindictiveness of Venus surrounding him,
      this Adonis of the lower household was a mighty man below, and he moved as
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing the tumult that followed Berry&rsquo;s arrival, Adrian sent for him,
      and was informed of the nature of his mission, and its result.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should come to me first,&rdquo; said Adrian. &ldquo;I should have imagined you
      were shrewd enough for that, Berry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, Mr. Adrian,&rdquo; Berry doubled his elbow to explain. &ldquo;Pardon me,
      sir. Acting recipient of special injunctions I was not a free agent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to Mr. Richard again, Berry. There will be a little confusion if he
      holds back. Perhaps you had better throw out a hint or so of apoplexy. A
      slight hint will do. And here&mdash;Berry! when you return to town, you
      had better not mention anything&mdash;to quote Johnson&mdash;of Benson&rsquo;s
      spiflication.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wise youth&rsquo;s hint had the desired effect on Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dashed off a hasty letter by Tom to Belthorpe, and, mounting his horse,
      galloped to the Bellingham station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin was sitting down to a quiet early dinner at his hotel, when the
      Hope of Raynham burst into his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baronet was not angry with his son. On the contrary, for he was
      singularly just and self-accusing while pride was not up in arms, he had
      been thinking all day after the receipt of Benson&rsquo;s letter that he was
      deficient in cordiality, and did not, by reason of his excessive anxiety,
      make himself sufficiently his son&rsquo;s companion: was not enough, as he
      strove to be, mother and father to him; preceptor and friend; previsor and
      associate. He had not to ask his conscience where he had lately been to
      blame towards the System. He had slunk away from Raynham in the very
      crisis of the Magnetic Age, and this young woman of the parish (as Benson
      had termed sweet Lucy in his letter) was the consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes! pride and sensitiveness were his chief foes, and he would trample on
      them. To begin, he embraced his son: hard upon an Englishman at any time&mdash;doubly
      so to one so shamefaced at emotion in cool blood, as it were. It gave him
      a strange pleasure, nevertheless. And the youth seemed to answer to it; he
      was excited. Was his love, then, beginning to correspond with his father&rsquo;s
      as in those intimate days before the Blossoming Season?
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Richard, inarticulate at first in his haste, cried out, &ldquo;My dear,
      dear father! You are safe! I feared&mdash;You are better, sir? Thank God!&rdquo;
       Sir Austin stood away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safe?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What has alarmed you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of replying, Richard dropped into a chair, and seized his hand and
      kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin took a seat, and waited for his son to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those doctors are such fools!&rdquo; Richard broke out. &ldquo;I was sure they were
      wrong. They don&rsquo;t know headache from apoplexy. It&rsquo;s worth the ride, sir,
      to see you. You left Raynham so suddenly.&mdash;But you are well! It was
      not an attack of real apoplexy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His father&rsquo;s brows contorted, and he said, No, it was not. Richard
      pursued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were ill, I couldn&rsquo;t come too soon, though, if coroners&rsquo; inquests
      sat on horses, those doctors would be found guilty of mare-slaughter.
      Cassandra&rsquo;ll be knocked up. I was too early for the train at Bellingham,
      and I wouldn&rsquo;t wait. She did the distance in four hours and
      three-quarters. Pretty good, sir, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has given you appetite for dinner, I hope,&rdquo; said the baronet, not so
      well pleased to find that it was not simple obedience that had brought the
      youth to him in such haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; replied Richard. &ldquo;I shall be in time to return by the last
      train to-night. I will leave Cassandra in your charge for a rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His father quietly helped him to soup, which he commenced gobbling with an
      eagerness that might pass for appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All well at Raynham?&rdquo; said the baronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing new?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same as when I left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No change whatever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be glad to get back to the old place,&rdquo; said the baronet. &ldquo;My stay
      in town has certainly been profitable. I have made some pleasant
      acquaintances who may probably favour us with a visit there in the late
      autumn&mdash;people you may be pleased to know. They are very anxious to
      see Raynham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love the old place,&rdquo; cried Richard. &ldquo;I never wish to leave it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, boy, before I left you were constantly begging to see town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I, sir? How odd! Well! I don&rsquo;t want to remain here. I&rsquo;ve seen enough
      of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you find your way to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard laughed, and related his bewilderment at the miles of brick, and
      the noise, and the troops of people, concluding, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no place like
      home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baronet watched his symptomatic brilliant eyes, and favoured him with
      a double-dealing sentence&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To anchor the heart by any object ere we have half traversed the world,
      is youth&rsquo;s foolishness, my son. Reverence time! A better maxim that than
      your Horatian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows all!&rdquo; thought Richard, and instantly drew away leagues from his
      father, and threw up fortifications round his love and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner over, Richard looked hurriedly at his watch, and said, with much
      briskness, &ldquo;I shall just be in time, sir, if we walk. Will you come with
      me to the station?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baronet did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard was going to repeat the question, but found his father&rsquo;s eyes
      fixed on him so meaningly that he wavered, and played with his empty
      glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we will have a little more claret,&rdquo; said the baronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claret was brought, and they were left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baronet then drew within arm&rsquo;s-reach of his son, and began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not aware what you may have thought of me, Richard, during the years
      we have lived together; and indeed I have never been in a hurry to be
      known to you; and, if I had died before my work was done, I should not
      have complained at losing half my reward, in hearing you thank me.
      Perhaps, as it is, I never may. Everything, save selfishness, has its
      recompense. I shall be content if you prosper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fetched a breath and continued: &ldquo;You had in your infancy a great loss.&rdquo;
       Father and son coloured simultaneously. &ldquo;To make that good to you I chose
      to isolate myself from the world, and devote myself entirely to your
      welfare; and I think it is not vanity that tells me now that the son I
      have reared is one of the most hopeful of God&rsquo;s creatures. But for that
      very reason you are open to be tempted the most, and to sink the deepest.
      It was the first of the angels who made the road to hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused again. Richard fingered at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In our House, my son, there is peculiar blood. We go to wreck very
      easily. It sounds like superstition; I cannot but think we are tried as
      most men are not. I see it in us all. And you, my son, are compounded of
      two races. Your passions are violent. You have had a taste of revenge. You
      have seen, in a small way, that the pound of flesh draws rivers of blood.
      But there is now in you another power. You are mounting to the table-land
      of life, where mimic battles are changed to real ones. And you come upon
      it laden equally with force to create and to destroy.&rdquo; He deliberated to
      announce the intelligence, with deep meaning: &ldquo;There are women in the
      world, my son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s heart galloped back to Raynham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is when you encounter them that you are thoroughly on trial. It is
      when you know them that life is either a mockery to you, or, as some find
      it, a gift of blessedness. They are our ordeal. Love of any human object
      is the soul&rsquo;s ordeal; and they are ours, loving them, or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man heard the whistle of the train. He saw the moon-lighted
      wood, and the vision of his beloved. He could barely hold himself down and
      listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; the baronet spoke with little of the cheerfulness of belief,
      &ldquo;good women exist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, if he knew Lucy!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; and he gazed on Richard intently, &ldquo;it is given to very few to meet
      them on the threshold&mdash;I may say, to none. We find them after hard
      buffeting, and usually, when we find the one fitted for us, our madness
      has misshaped our destiny, our lot is cast. For women are not the end, but
      the means, of life. In youth we think them the former, and thousands, who
      have not even the excuse of youth, select a mate&mdash;or worse&mdash;with
      that sole view. I believe women punish us for so perverting their uses.
      They punish Society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baronet put his hand to his brow as his mind travelled into
      consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our most diligent pupil learns not so much as an earnest teacher,&rsquo; says
      The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip; and Sir Austin, in schooling himself to speak with
      moderation of women, was beginning to get a glimpse of their side of the
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cold Blood now touched on love to Hot Blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cold Blood said, &ldquo;It is a passion coming in the order of nature, the ripe
      fruit of our animal being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hot Blood felt: &ldquo;It is a divinity! All that is worth living for in the
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cold Blood said: &ldquo;It is a fever which tests our strength, and too often
      leads to perdition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hot Blood felt: &ldquo;Lead whither it will, I follow it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cold Blood said: &ldquo;It is a name men and women are much in the habit of
      employing to sanctify their appetites.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hot Blood felt: &ldquo;It is worship; religion; life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so the two parallel lines ran on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baronet became more personal:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know my love for you, my son. The extent of it you cannot know; but
      you must know that it is something very deep, and&mdash;I do not wish to
      speak of it&mdash;but a father must sometimes petition for gratitude,
      since the only true expression of it is his son&rsquo;s moral good. If you care
      for my love, or love me in return, aid me with all your energies to keep
      you what I have made you, and guard you from the snares besetting you. It
      was in my hands once. It is ceasing to be so. Remember, my son, what my
      love is. It is different, I fear, with most fathers: but I am bound up in
      your welfare: what you do affects me vitally. You will take no step that
      is not intimate with my happiness, or my misery. And I have had great
      disappointments, my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So far it was well. Richard loved his father, and even in his frenzied
      state he could not without emotion hear him thus speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappily, the baronet, who by some fatality never could see when he was
      winning the battle, thought proper in his wisdom to water the dryness of
      his sermon with a little jocoseness, on the subject of young men fancying
      themselves in love, and, when they were raw and green, absolutely wanting
      to be&mdash;that most awful thing, which the wisest and strongest of men
      undertake in hesitation and after self-mortification and penance&mdash;married!
      He sketched the Foolish Young Fellow&mdash;the object of general ridicule
      and covert contempt. He sketched the Woman&mdash;the strange thing made in
      our image, and with all our faculties&mdash;passing to the rule of one who
      in taking her proved that he could not rule himself, and had no knowledge
      of her save as a choice morsel which he would burn the whole world, and
      himself in the bargain, to possess. He harped upon the Foolish Young
      Fellow, till the foolish young fellow felt his skin tingle and was half
      suffocated with shame and rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, the baronet might be as wise as he pleased: he had quite
      undone his work. He might analyze Love and anatomize Woman. He might
      accord to her her due position, and paint her fair: he might be shrewd,
      jocose, gentle, pathetic, wonderfully wise: he spoke to deaf ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Closing his sermon with the question, softly uttered: &ldquo;Have you anything
      to tell me, Richard?&rdquo; and hoping for a confession, and a thorough
      re-establishment of confidence, the callous answer struck him cold: &ldquo;I
      have not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baronet relapsed in his chair, and made diagrams of his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard turned his back on further dialogue by going to the window. In the
      section of sky over the street twinkled two or three stars; shining
      faintly, feeling the moon. The moon was rising: the woods were lifting up
      to her: his star of the woods would be there. A bed of moss set about
      flowers in a basket under him breathed to his nostril of the woodland
      keenly, and filled him with delirious longing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A succession of hard sighs brought his father&rsquo;s hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have nothing you could say to me, my son? Tell me, Richard! Remember,
      there is no home for the soul where dwells a shadow of untruth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all, sir,&rdquo; the young man replied, meeting him with the full
      orbs of his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baronet withdrew his hand, and paced the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last it grew impossible for Richard to control his impatience, and he
      said: &ldquo;Do you intend me to stay here, sir? Am I not to return to Raynham
      at all to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His father was again falsely jocular:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? and catch the train after giving it ten minutes&rsquo; start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cassandra will take me,&rdquo; said the young man earnestly. &ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t ride
      her hard, sir. Or perhaps you would lend me your Winkelried? I should be
      down with him in little better than three hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even then, you know, the park-gates would be locked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I could stable him in the village. Dowling knows the horse, and
      would treat him properly. May I have him, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cloud cleared off Richard&rsquo;s face as he asked. At least, if he missed
      his love that night he would be near her, breathing the same air, marking
      what star was above her bedchamber, hearing the hushed night-talk of the
      trees about her dwelling: looking on the distances that were like hope
      half fulfilled and a bodily presence bright as Hesper, since he knew her.
      There were two swallows under the eaves shadowing Lucy&rsquo;s chamber-windows:
      two swallows, mates in one nest, blissful birds, who twittered and
      cheep-cheeped to the sole-lying beauty in her bed. Around these birds the
      lover&rsquo;s heart revolved, he knew not why. He associated them with all his
      close-veiled dreams of happiness. Seldom a morning passed when he did not
      watch them leave the nest on their breakfast-flight, busy in the happy
      stillness of dawn. It seemed to him now that if he could be at Raynham to
      see them in to-morrow&rsquo;s dawn he would be compensated for his incalculable
      loss of to-night: he would forgive and love his father, London, the life,
      the world. Just to see those purple backs and white breasts flash out into
      the quiet morning air! He wanted no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baronet&rsquo;s trifling had placed this enormous boon within the young
      man&rsquo;s visionary grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      He still went on trying the boy&rsquo;s temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know there would be nobody ready for you at Raynham. It is unfair to
      disturb the maids.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard overrode every objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, my son,&rdquo; said the baronet, preserving his half-jocular air,
      &ldquo;I must tell you that it is my wish to have you in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have not been ill at all, sir!&rdquo; cried Richard, as in his despair
      he seized the whole plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been as well as you could have desired me to be,&rdquo; said his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did they lie to me?&rdquo; the young man wrathfully exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, Richard, you can best answer that,&rdquo; rejoined Sir Austin, kindly
      severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dread of being signalized as the Foolish Young Fellow prevented Richard
      from expostulating further. Sir Austin saw him grinding his passion into
      powder for future explosion, and thought it best to leave him for awhile.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      For three weeks Richard had to remain in town and endure the teachings of
      the System in a new atmosphere. He had to sit and listen to men of science
      who came to renew their intimacy with his father, and whom of all men his
      father wished him to respect and study; practically scientific men being,
      in the baronet&rsquo;s estimation, the only minds thoroughly mated and enviable.
      He had to endure an introduction to the Grandisons, and meet the eyes of
      his kind, haunted as he was by the Foolish Young Fellow. The idea that he
      might by any chance be identified with him held the poor youth in silent
      subjection. And it was horrible. For it was a continued outrage on the
      fair image he had in his heart. The notion of the world laughing at him
      because he loved sweet Lucy stung him to momentary frenzies, and developed
      premature misanthropy in his spirit. Also the System desired to show him
      whither young women of the parish lead us, and he was dragged about at
      nighttime to see the sons and daughters of darkness, after the fashion
      prescribed to Mr. Thompson; how they danced and ogled down the high road
      to perdition. But from this sight possibly the teacher learnt more than
      his pupil, since we find him seriously asking his meditative hours, in the
      Note-book: &ldquo;Wherefore Wild Oats are only of one gender?&rdquo; a question
      certainly not suggested to him at Raynham; and again&mdash;&ldquo;Whether men
      might not be attaching too rigid an importance?&rdquo;...to a subject with a
      dotted tail apparently, for he gives it no other in the Note-book. But, as
      I apprehend, he had come to plead in behalf of women here, and had deduced
      something from positive observation. To Richard the scenes he witnessed
      were strange wild pictures, likely if anything to have increased his
      misanthropy, but for his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain sweet little notes from Lucy sustained the lover during the first
      two weeks of exile. They ceased; and now Richard fell into such
      despondency that his father in alarm had to take measures to hasten their
      return to Raynham. At the close of the third week Berry laid a pair of
      letters, bearing the Raynham post-mark, on the breakfast-table, and, after
      reading one attentively, the baronet asked his son if he was inclined to
      quit the metropolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Raynham, air?&rdquo; cried Richard, and relapsed, saying, &ldquo;As you will!&rdquo;
       aware that he had given a glimpse of the Foolish Young Fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Berry accordingly received orders to make arrangements for their instant
      return to Raynham.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter Sir Austin lifted his head from to bespeak his son&rsquo;s wishes was
      a composition of the wise youth Adrian&rsquo;s, and ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benson is doggedly recovering. He requires great indemnities. Happy when
      a faithful fool is the main sufferer in a household! I quite agree with
      you that our faithful fool is the best servant of great schemes. Benson is
      now a piece of history. I tell him that this is indemnity enough, and that
      the sweet Muse usually insists upon gentlemen being half-flayed before she
      will condescend to notice them; but Benson, I regret to say, rejects the
      comfort so fine a reflection should offer, and had rather keep his skin
      and live opaque. Heroism seems partly a matter of training. Faithful folly
      is Benson&rsquo;s nature: the rest has been thrust upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young person has resigned the neighbourhood. I had an interview with
      the fair Papist myself, and also with the man Blaize. They were both
      sensible, though one swore and the other sighed. She is pretty. I hope she
      does not paint. I can affirm that her legs are strong, for she walks to
      Bellingham twice a week to take her Scarlet bath, when, having confessed
      and been made clean by the Romish unction, she walks back the brisker, of
      which my Protestant muscular systems is yet aware. It was on the road to
      Bellingham I engaged her. She is well in the matter of hair. Madam Godiva
      might challenge her, it would be a fair match. Has it never struck you
      that Woman is nearer the vegetable than Man?&mdash;Mr. Blaize intends her
      for his son a junction that every lover of fairy mythology must desire to
      see consummated. Young Tom is heir to all the agremens of the Beast. The
      maids of Lobourne say (I hear) that he is a very Proculus among them.
      Possibly the envious men say it for the maids. Beauty does not speak bad
      grammar&mdash;and altogether she is better out of the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other letter was from Lady Blandish, a lady&rsquo;s letter, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have fulfilled your commission to the best of my ability, and heartily
      sad it has made me. She is indeed very much above her station&mdash;pity
      that it is so! She is almost beautiful&mdash;quite beautiful at times, and
      not in any way what you have been led to fancy. The poor child had no
      story to tell. I have again seen her, and talked with her for an hour as
      kindly as I could. I could gather nothing more than we know. It is just a
      woman&rsquo;s history as it invariably commences. Richard is the god of her
      idolatry. She will renounce him, and sacrifice herself for his sake. Are
      we so bad? She asked me what she was to do. She would do whatever was
      imposed upon her&mdash;all but pretend to love another, and that she never
      would, and, I believe, never will. You know I am sentimental, and I
      confess we dropped a few tears together. Her uncle has sent her for the
      Winter to the institution where it appears she was educated, and where
      they are very fond of her and want to keep her, which it would be a good
      thing if they were to do. The man is a good sort of man. She was entrusted
      to him by her father, and he never interferes with her religion, and is
      very scrupulous about all that pertains to it, though, as he says, he is a
      Christian himself. In the Spring (but the poor child does not know this)
      she is to come back, and be married to his lout of a son. I am determined
      to prevent that. May I not reckon on your promise to aid me? When you see
      her, I am sure you will. It would be sacrilege to look on and permit such
      a thing. You know, they are cousins. She asked me, where in the world
      there was one like Richard? What could I answer? They were your own words,
      and spoken with a depth of conviction! I hope he is really calm. I shudder
      to think of him when he comes, and discovers what I have been doing. I
      hope I have been really doing right! A good deed, you say, never dies; but
      we cannot always know&mdash;I must rely on you. Yes, it is; I should
      think, easy to suffer martyrdom when one is sure of one&rsquo;s cause! but then
      one must be sure of it. I have done nothing lately but to repeat to myself
      that saying of yours, No. 54, C. 7, P.S.; and it has consoled me, I cannot
      say why, except that all wisdom consoles, whether it applies directly or
      not:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;For this reason so many fall from God, who have attained to Him; that
      they cling to Him with their Weakness, not with their Strength.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like to know of what you are thinking when you composed this or that
      saying&mdash;what suggested it. May not one be admitted to inspect the
      machinery of wisdom? I feel curious to know how thoughts&mdash;real
      thoughts&mdash;are born. Not that I hope to win the secret. Here is the
      beginning of one (but we poor women can never put together even two of the
      three ideas which you say go to form a thought): &lsquo;When a wise man makes a
      false step, will he not go farther than a fool?&rsquo; It has just flitted
      through me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot get on with Gibbon, so wait your return to recommence the
      readings. I dislike the sneering essence of his writings. I keep referring
      to his face, until the dislike seems to become personal. How different is
      it with Wordsworth! And yet I cannot escape from the thought that he is
      always solemnly thinking of himself (but I do reverence him). But this is
      curious; Byron was a greater egoist, and yet I do not feel the same with
      him. He reminds me of a beast of the desert, savage and beautiful; and the
      former is what one would imagine a superior donkey reclaimed from the
      heathen to be&mdash;a very superior donkey, I mean, with great power of
      speech and great natural complacency, and whose stubbornness you must
      admire as part of his mission. The worst is that no one will imagine
      anything sublime in a superior donkey, so my simile is unfair and false.
      Is it not strange? I love Wordsworth best, and yet Byron has the greater
      power over me. How is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Sir Austin wrote beside the query in pencil, &ldquo;women are
      cowards, and succumb to Irony and Passion, rather than yield their hearts
      to Excellence and Nature&rsquo;s Inspiration.&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter pursued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have finished Boiardo and have taken up Berni. The latter offends me. I
      suppose we women do not really care for humour. You are right in saying we
      have none ourselves, and &lsquo;cackle&rsquo; instead of laugh. It is true (of me, at
      least) that &lsquo;Falstaff is only to us an incorrigible fat man.&rsquo; I want to
      know what he illustrates. And Don Quixote&mdash;what end can be served in
      making a noble mind ridiculous?&mdash;I hear you say&mdash;practical. So
      it is. We are very narrow, I know. But we like wit&mdash;practical again!
      Or in your words (when I really think they generally come to my aid&mdash;perhaps
      it is that it is often all your thought); we &lsquo;prefer the rapier thrust, to
      the broad embrace, of Intelligence.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He trifled with the letter for some time, re-reading chosen passages as he
      walked about the room, and considering he scarce knew what. There are
      ideas language is too gross for, and shape too arbitrary, which come to us
      and have a definite influence upon us, and yet we cannot fasten on the
      filmy things and make them visible and distinct to ourselves, much less to
      others. Why did he twice throw a look into the glass in the act of passing
      it? He stood for a moment with head erect facing it. His eyes for the
      nonce seemed little to peruse his outer features; the grey gathered brows,
      and the wrinkles much action of them had traced over the circles half up
      his high straight forehead; the iron-grey hair that rose over his forehead
      and fell away in the fashion of Richard&rsquo;s plume. His general appearance
      showed the tints of years; but none of their weight, and nothing of the
      dignity of his youth, was gone. It was so far satisfactory, but his eyes
      were wide, as one who looks at his essential self through the mask we
      wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he was speculating as he looked on the sort of aspect he presented
      to the lady&rsquo;s discriminative regard. Of her feelings he had not a
      suspicion. But he knew with what extraordinary lucidity women can, when it
      pleases them, and when their feelings are not quite boiling under the
      noonday sun, seize all the sides of a character, and put their fingers on
      its weak point. He was cognizant of the total absence of the humorous in
      himself (the want that most shut him out from his fellows), and perhaps
      the clear-thoughted, intensely self-examining gentleman filmily conceived,
      Me also, in common with the poet, she gazes on as one of the superior&mdash;grey
      beasts!
    </p>
    <p>
      He may have so conceived the case; he was capable of that
      great-mindedness, and could snatch at times very luminous glances at the
      broad reflector which the world of fact lying outside our narrow compass
      holds up for us to see ourselves in when we will. Unhappily, the faculty
      of laughter, which is due to this gift, was denied him; and having seen,
      he, like the companion of friend Balsam, could go no farther. For a good
      wind of laughter had relieved him of much of the blight of self-deception,
      and oddness, and extravagance; had given a healthier view of our
      atmosphere of life; but he had it not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Journeying back to Bellingham in the train, with the heated brain and
      brilliant eye of his son beside him, Sir Austin tried hard to feel
      infallible, as a man with a System should feel; and because he could not
      do so, after much mental conflict, he descended to entertain a personal
      antagonism to the young woman who had stepped in between his experiment
      and success. He did not think kindly of her. Lady Blandish&rsquo;s encomiums of
      her behaviour and her beauty annoyed him. Forgetful that he had in a
      measure forfeited his rights to it, he took the common ground of fathers,
      and demanded, &ldquo;Why he was not justified in doing all that lay in his power
      to prevent his son from casting himself away upon the first creature with
      a pretty face he encountered?&rdquo; Deliberating thus, he lost the tenderness
      he should have had for his experiment&mdash;the living, burning youth at
      his elbow, and his excessive love for him took a rigorous tone. It
      appeared to him politic, reasonable, and just, that the uncle of this
      young woman, who had so long nursed the prudent scheme of marrying her to
      his son, should not only not be thwarted in his object but encouraged and
      even assisted. At least, not thwarted. Sir Austin had no glass before him
      while these ideas hardened in his mind, and he had rather forgotten the
      letter of Lady Blandish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father and son were alone in the railway carriage. Both were too
      preoccupied to speak. As they neared Bellingham the dark was filling the
      hollows of the country. Over the pine-hills beyond the station a last rosy
      streak lingered across a green sky. Richard eyed it while they flew along.
      It caught him forward: it seemed full of the spirit of his love, and
      brought tears of mournful longing to his eyelids. The sad beauty of that
      one spot in the heavens seemed to call out to his soul to swear to his
      Lucy&rsquo;s truth to him: was like the sorrowful visage of his fleur-de-luce as
      he called her, appealing to him for faith. That tremulous tender way she
      had of half-closing and catching light on the nether-lids, when sometimes
      she looked up in her lover&rsquo;s face&mdash;as look so mystic-sweet that it
      had grown to be the fountain of his dreams: he saw it yonder, and his
      blood thrilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Know you those wand-like touches of I know not what, before which our
      grosser being melts; and we, much as we hope to be in the Awaking, stand
      etherealized, trembling with new joy? They come but rarely; rarely even in
      love, when we fondly think them revelations. Mere sensations they are,
      doubtless: and we rank for them no higher in the spiritual scale than so
      many translucent glorious polypi that quiver on the shores, the hues of
      heaven running through them. Yet in the harvest of our days it is
      something for the animal to have had such mere fleshly polypian
      experiences to look back upon, and they give him an horizon&mdash;pale
      seas of luring splendour. One who has had them (when they do not bound
      him) may find the Isles of Bliss sooner than another. Sensual faith in the
      upper glories is something. &ldquo;Let us remember,&rdquo; says The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip,
      &ldquo;that Nature, though heathenish, reaches at her best to the footstool of
      the Highest. She is not all dust, but a living portion of the spheres. In
      aspiration it is our error to despise her, forgetting that through Nature
      only can we ascend. Cherished, trained, and purified, she is then partly
      worthy the divine mate who is to make her wholly so. St. Simeon saw the
      Hog in Nature, and took Nature for the Hog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was one of these strange bodily exaltations which thrilled the young
      man, he knew not how it was, for sadness and his forebodings vanished. The
      soft wand touched him. At that moment, had Sir Austin spoken openly,
      Richard might have fallen upon his heart. He could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      He chose to feel injured on the common ground of fathers, and to pursue
      his System by plotting. Lady Blandish had revived his jealousy of the
      creature who menaced it, and jealousy of a System is unreflecting and
      vindictive as jealousy of woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heath-roots and pines breathed sharp in the cool autumn evening about the
      Bellingham station. Richard stood a moment as he stepped from the train,
      and drew the country air into his lungs with large heaves of the chest.
      Leaving his father to the felicitations of the station-master, he went
      into the Lobourne road to look for his faithful Tom, who had received
      private orders through Berry to be in attendance with his young master&rsquo;s
      mare, Cassandra, and was lurking in a plantation of firs unenclosed on the
      borders of the road, where Richard, knowing his retainer&rsquo;s zest for
      conspiracy too well to seek him anywhere but in the part most favoured
      with shelter and concealment, found him furtively whiffing tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What news, Tom? Is there an illness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom sent his undress cap on one side to scratch at dilemma, an old
      agricultural habit to which he was still a slave in moments of abstract
      thought or sudden difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want the rake, Mr. Richard,&rdquo; he whinnied with a false grin,
      as he beheld his master&rsquo;s eye vacantly following the action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak out!&rdquo; he was commanded. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had a letter for a week!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard learnt the news. He took it with surprising outward calm, only
      getting a little closer to Cassandra&rsquo;s neck, and looking very hard at Tom
      without seeing a speck of him, which had the effect on Tom of making him
      sincerely wish his master would punch his head at once rather than fix him
      in that owl-like way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; said Richard, huskily. &ldquo;Yes? She&rsquo;s gone! Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom was brought to understand he must make the most of trifles, and
      recited how he had heard from a female domestic at Belthorpe of the name
      of Davenport, formerly known to him, that the young lady never slept a
      wink from the hour she knew she was going, but sat up in her bed till
      morning crying most pitifully, though she never complained. Hereat the
      tears unconsciously streamed down Richard&rsquo;s cheeks. Tom said he had tried
      to see her, but Mr. Adrian kept him at work, ciphering at a terrible sum&mdash;that
      and nothing else all day! saying, it was to please his young master on his
      return. &ldquo;Likewise something in Lat&rsquo;n,&rdquo; added Tom. &ldquo;Nom&rsquo;tive Mouser!&mdash;&lsquo;nough
      to make ye mad, sir!&rdquo; he exclaimed with pathos. The wretch had been put to
      acquire a Latin declension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom saw her on the morning she went away, he said: she was very
      sorrowful-looking, and nodded kindly to him as she passed in the fly along
      with young Tom Blaize. &ldquo;She have got uncommon kind eyes, sir,&rdquo; said Tom,
      &ldquo;and cryin&rsquo; don&rsquo;t spoil them.&rdquo; For which his hand was wrenched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had no more to tell, save that, in rounding the road, the young lady
      had hung out her hand, and seemed to move it forward and back, as much as
      to sap, Good-bye, Tom! &ldquo;And though she couldn&rsquo;t see me,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;I took
      off my hat. I did take it so kind of her to think of a chap like me.&rdquo; He
      was at high-pressure sentiment&mdash;what with his education for a hero
      and his master&rsquo;s love-stricken state.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw no more of her, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. That was the last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the last you saw of her, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I saw nothin&rsquo; more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so she went out of sight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clean gone, that she were, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did they take her away? what have they done with her? where have they
      taken her to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These red-hot questionings were addressed to the universal heaven rather
      than to Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t she write?&rdquo; they were resumed. &ldquo;Why did she leave? She&rsquo;s mine.
      She belongs to me! Who dared take her away? Why did she leave without
      writing?&mdash;Tom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the well-drilled recruit, dressing himself up to the word
      of command. He expected a variation of the theme from the change of tone
      with which his name had been pronounced, but it was again, &ldquo;Where have
      they taken her to?&rdquo; and this was even more perplexing to Tom than his hard
      sum in arithmetic had been. He could only draw down the corners of his
      mouth hard, and glance up queerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had been crying&mdash;you saw that, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No mistake about that, Mr. Richard. Cryin&rsquo; all night and all day, I sh&rsquo;d
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she was crying when you saw her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She look&rsquo;d as if she&rsquo;d just done for a moment, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But her face was white?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White as a sheet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard paused to discover whether his instinct had caught a new view from
      these facts. He was in a cage, always knocking against the same bars, fly
      as he might. Her tears were the stars in his black night. He clung to them
      as golden orbs. Inexplicable as they were, they were at least pledges of
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hues of sunset had left the West. No light was there but the steadfast
      pale eye of twilight. Thither he was drawn. He mounted Cassandra, saying:
      &ldquo;Tell them something, Tom. I shan&rsquo;t be home to dinner,&rdquo; and rode off
      toward the forsaken home of light over Belthorpe, whereat he saw the wan
      hand of his Lucy, waving farewell, receding as he advanced. His jewel was
      stolen,&mdash;he must gaze upon the empty box.

      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Night had come on as Richard entered the old elm-shaded, grass-bordered
      lane leading down from Raynham to Belthorpe. The pale eye of twilight was
      shut. The wind had tossed up the bank of Western cloud, which was now
      flying broad and unlighted across the sky, broad and balmy&mdash;the
      charioted South-west at full charge behind his panting coursers. As he
      neared the farm his heart fluttered and leapt up. He was sure she must be
      there. She must have returned. Why should she have left for good without
      writing? He caught suspicion by the throat, making it voiceless, if it
      lived: he silenced reason. Her not writing was now a proof that she had
      returned. He listened to nothing but his imperious passion, and murmured
      sweet words for her, as if she were by: tender cherishing epithet&rsquo;s of
      love in the nest. She was there&mdash;she moved somewhere about like a
      silver flame in the dear old house, doing her sweet household duties. His
      blood began to sing: O happy those within, to see her, and be about her!
      By some extraordinary process he contrived to cast a sort of glory round
      the burly person of Farmer Blaize himself. And oh! to have companionship
      with a seraph one must know a seraph&rsquo;s bliss, and was not young Tom to be
      envied? The smell of late clematis brought on the wind enwrapped him, and
      went to his brain, and threw a light over the old red-brick house, for he
      remembered where it grew, and the winter rose-tree, and the jessamine, and
      the passion-flower: the garden in front with the standard roses tended by
      her hands; the long wall to the left striped by the branches of the
      cherry, the peep of a further garden through the wall, and then the
      orchard, and the fields beyond&mdash;the happy circle of her dwelling! it
      flashed before his eyes while he looked on the darkness. And yet it was
      the reverse of hope which kindled this light and inspired the momentary
      calm he experienced: it was despair exaggerating delusion, wilfully
      building up on a groundless basis. &ldquo;For the tenacity of true passion is
      terrible,&rdquo; says The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip: &ldquo;it will stand against the hosts of
      heaven, God&rsquo;s great array of Facts, rather than surrender its aim, and
      must be crushed before it will succumb&mdash;sent to the lowest pit!&rdquo; He
      knew she was not there; she was gone. But the power of a will strained to
      madness fought at it, kept it down, conjured forth her ghost, and would
      have it as he dictated. Poor youth! the great array of facts was in due
      order of march.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had breathed her name many times, and once over-loud; almost a cry for
      her escaped him. He had not noticed the opening of a door and the noise of
      a foot along the gravel walk. He was leaning over Cassandra&rsquo;s uneasy neck
      watching the one window intently, when a voice addressed him out of the
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be that you, young gentleman?&mdash;Mr. Fev&rsquo;rel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard&rsquo;s trance was broken. &ldquo;Mr. Blaize!&rdquo; he said; recognizing the
      farmer&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good even&rsquo;n t&rsquo; you, sir,&rdquo; returned the farmer. &ldquo;I knew the mare though I
      didn&rsquo;t know you. Rather bluff to-night it be. Will ye step in, Mr.
      Fev&rsquo;rel? it&rsquo;s beginning&rsquo; to spit,&mdash;going to be a wildish night, I
      reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard dismounted. The farmer called one of his men to hold the mare, and
      ushered the young man in. Once there, Richard&rsquo;s conjurations ceased. There
      was a deadness about the rooms and passages that told of her absence. The
      walls he touched&mdash;these were the vacant shells of her. He had never
      been in the house since he knew her, and now what strange sweetness, and
      what pangs!
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Tom Blaize was in the parlour, squared over the table in
      open-mouthed examination of an ancient book of the fashions for a summer
      month which had elapsed during his mother&rsquo;s minority. Young Tom was
      respectfully studying the aspects of the radiant beauties of the polite
      work. He also was a thrall of woman, newly enrolled, and full of wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Tom!&rdquo; the farmer sang out as soon as he had opened the door; &ldquo;there
      ye be! at yer Folly agin, are ye? What good&rsquo;ll them fashens do to you, I&rsquo;d
      like t&rsquo;know? Come, shut up, and go and see to Mr. Fev&rsquo;rel&rsquo;s mare. He&rsquo;s
      al&rsquo;ays at that ther&rsquo; Folly now. I say there never were a better name for a
      book than that ther&rsquo; Folly! Talk about attitudes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The farmer laughed his fat sides into a chair, and motioned his visitor to
      do likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a comfort they&rsquo;re most on &lsquo;em females,&rdquo; he pursued, sounding a
      thwack on his knee as he settled himself agreeably in his seat. &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t
      matter much what they does, except pinchin&rsquo; in&mdash;waspin&rsquo; it at the
      waist. Give me nature, I say&mdash;woman as she&rsquo;s made! eh, young
      gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem very lonely here,&rdquo; said Richard, glancing round, and at the
      ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lonely?&rdquo; quoth the farmer. &ldquo;Well, for the matter o&rsquo; that, we be!&mdash;jest
      now, so&rsquo;t happens; I&rsquo;ve got my pipe, and Tom&rsquo;ve got his Folly. He&rsquo;s on one
      side the table, and I&rsquo;m on t&rsquo;other. He gapes, and I gazes. We are a bit
      lonesome. But there&mdash;it&rsquo;s for the best!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard resumed, &ldquo;I hardly expected to see you to-night, Mr. Blaize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y&rsquo;acted like a man in coming, young gentleman, and I does ye honour for
      it!&rdquo; said Farmer Blaize with sudden energy and directness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing implied by the farmer&rsquo;s words caused Richard to take a quick
      breath. They looked at each other, and looked away, the farmer thrumming
      on the arm of his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above the mantel-piece, surrounded by tarnished indifferent miniatures of
      high-collared, well-to-do yeomen of the anterior generation, trying their
      best not to grin, and high-waisted old ladies smiling an encouraging smile
      through plentiful cap-puckers, there hung a passably executed half-figure
      of a naval officer in uniform, grasping a telescope under his left arm,
      who stood forth clearly as not of their kith and kin. His eyes were blue,
      his hair light, his bearing that of a man who knows how to carry his head
      and shoulders. The artist, while giving him an epaulette to indicate his
      rank, had also recorded the juvenility which a lieutenant in the naval
      service can retain after arriving at that position, by painting him with
      smooth cheeks and fresh ruddy lips. To this portrait Richard&rsquo;s eyes were
      directed. Farmer Blaize observed it, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her father, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard moderated his voice to praise the likeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;pretty well. Next best to havin&rsquo; her, though it&rsquo;s
      a long way off that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An old family, Mr. Blaize&mdash;is it not?&rdquo; Richard asked in as careless
      a tone as he could assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlefolks&mdash;what&rsquo;s left of &lsquo;em,&rdquo; replied the farmer with an equally
      affected indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s her father?&rdquo; said Richard, growing bolder to speak of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s her father, young gentleman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Blaize,&rdquo; Richard turned to face him, and burst out, &ldquo;where is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone, sir! packed off!&mdash;Can&rsquo;t have her here now.&rdquo; The farmer
      thrummed a step brisker, and eyed the young man&rsquo;s wild face resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Blaize,&rdquo; Richard leaned forward to get closer to him. He was stunned,
      and hardly aware of what he was saying or doing: &ldquo;Where has she gone? Why
      did she leave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t to ask, sir&mdash;ye know,&rdquo; said the farmer, with a side shot
      of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she did not&mdash;it was not her wish to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I think she likes the place. Mayhap she likes&rsquo;t too well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you send her away to make her unhappy, Mr. Blaize?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The farmer bluntly denied it was he was the party who made her unhappy.
      &ldquo;Nobody can&rsquo;t accuse me. Tell ye what, sir. I wunt have the busybodies set
      to work about her, and there&rsquo;s all the matter. So let you and I come to an
      understandin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A blind inclination to take offence made Richard sit upright. He forgot it
      the next minute, and said humbly: &ldquo;Am I the cause of her going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; returned the farmer, &ldquo;to speak straight&mdash;ye be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do, Mr. Blaize, that she may come back again&rdquo; the young
      hypocrite asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re coming to business. Glad to hear ye talk
      in that sensible way, Mr. Feverel. You may guess I wants her bad enough.
      The house ain&rsquo;t itself now she&rsquo;s away, and I ain&rsquo;t myself. Well, sir! This
      ye can do. If you gives me your promise not to meddle with her at all&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t mak&rsquo; out how you come to be acquainted; not to try to get her to be
      meetin&rsquo; you&mdash;and if you&rsquo;d &lsquo;a seen her when she left, you would&mdash;when
      did ye meet?&mdash;last grass, wasn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;your word as a gentleman
      not to be writing letters, and spyin&rsquo; after her&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have her back
      at once. Back she shall come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give her up!&rdquo; cried Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; said the farmer. &ldquo;Give her up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man checked the annihilation of time that was on his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sent her away to protect her from me, then?&rdquo; he said savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not quite it, but that&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; rejoined the farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I shall harm her, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People seem to think she&rsquo;ll harm you, young gentleman,&rdquo; the farmer said
      with some irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harm me&mdash;she? What people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People pretty intimate with you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What people? Who spoke of us?&rdquo; Richard began to scent a plot, and would
      not be balked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, look here,&rdquo; said the farmer. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t no secret, and if it
      be, I don&rsquo;t see why I&rsquo;m to keep it. It appears your education&rsquo;s peculiar!&rdquo;
       The farmer drawled out the word as if he were describing the figure of a
      snake. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t to be as other young gentlemen. All the better! You&rsquo;re a
      fine bold young gentleman, and your father&rsquo;s a right to be proud of ye.
      Well, sir&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure I thank him for&rsquo;t he comes to hear of you and
      Luce, and of course he don&rsquo;t want nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; that&mdash;more do I. I meets
      him there! What&rsquo;s more I won&rsquo;t have nothin&rsquo; of it. She be my gal. She were
      left to my protection. And she&rsquo;s a lady, sir. Let me tell ye, ye won&rsquo;t
      find many on &lsquo;em so well looked to as she be&mdash;my Luce! Well, Mr.
      Fev&rsquo;rel, it&rsquo;s you, or it&rsquo;s her&mdash;one of ye must be out o&rsquo; the way. So
      we&rsquo;re told. And Luce&mdash;I do believe she&rsquo;s just as anxious about yer
      education as yer father she says she&rsquo;ll go, and wouldn&rsquo;t write, and&rsquo;d
      break it off for the sake o&rsquo; your education. And she&rsquo;ve kep&rsquo; her word,
      haven&rsquo;t she?&mdash;She&rsquo;s a true&rsquo;n. What she says she&rsquo;ll do!&mdash;True
      blue she be, my Luce! So now, sir, you do the same, and I&rsquo;ll thank ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Any one who has tossed a sheet of paper into the fire, and seen it
      gradually brown with heat, and strike to flame, may conceive the mind of
      the lover as he listened to this speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      His anger did not evaporate in words, but condensed and sank deep. &ldquo;Mr.
      Blaize,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is very kind of the people you allude to, but I am
      of an age now to think and act for myself&mdash;I love her, sir!&rdquo; His
      whole countenance changed, and the muscles of his face quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said the farmer, appeasingly, &ldquo;we all do at your age&mdash;somebody
      or other. It&rsquo;s natural!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love her!&rdquo; the young man thundered afresh, too much possessed by his
      passion to have a sense of shame in the confession. &ldquo;Farmer!&rdquo; his voice
      fell to supplication, &ldquo;will you bring her back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Blaize made a queer face. He asked&mdash;what for? and where was
      the promise required?&mdash;But was not the lover&rsquo;s argument conclusive?
      He said he loved her! and he could not see why her uncle should not in
      consequence immediately send for her, that they might be together. All
      very well, quoth the farmer, but what&rsquo;s to come of it?&mdash;What was to
      come of it? Why, love, and more love! And a bit too much! the farmer added
      grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you refuse me, farmer,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;I must look to you for
      keeping her away from me, not to&mdash;to&mdash;these people. You will not
      have her back, though I tell you I love her better than my life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Blaize now had to answer him plainly, he had a reason and an
      objection of his own. And it was, that her character was at stake, and God
      knew whether she herself might not be in danger. He spoke with a kindly
      candour, not without dignity. He complimented Richard personally, but
      young people were young people; baronets&rsquo; sons were not in the habit of
      marrying farmers&rsquo; nieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the son of a System did not comprehend him. When he did, he said:
      &ldquo;Farmer! if I give you my word of honour, as I hope for heaven, to marry
      her when I am of age, will you have her back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was so fervid that, to quiet him, the farmer only shook his head
      doubtfully at the bars of the grate, and let his chest fall slowly.
      Richard caught what seemed to him a glimpse of encouragement in these
      signs, and observed: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not because you object to me, Mr. Blaize?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The farmer signified it was not that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because my father is against me,&rdquo; Richard went on, and undertook to
      show that love was so sacred a matter that no father could entirely and
      for ever resist his son&rsquo;s inclinations. Argument being a cool field where
      the farmer could meet and match him, the young man got on the tramroad of
      his passion, and went ahead. He drew pictures of Lucy, of her truth, and
      his own. He took leaps from life to death, from death to life, mixing
      imprecations and prayers in a torrent. Perhaps he did move the stolid old
      Englishman a little, he was so vehement, and made so visible a sacrifice
      of his pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farmer Blaize tried to pacify him, but it was useless. His jewel he must
      have.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer stretched out his hand for the pipe that allayeth botheration.
      &ldquo;May smoke heer now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not when&mdash;somebody&rsquo;s present. Smoke
      in the kitchen then. Don&rsquo;t mind smell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard nodded, and watched the operations while the farmer filled, and
      lighted, and began to puff, as if his fate hung on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d a&rsquo; thought, when you sat over there once, of its comin&rsquo; to this?&rdquo;
       ejaculated the farmer, drawing ease and reflection from tobacco. &ldquo;You
      didn&rsquo;t think much of her that day, young gentleman! I introduced ye. Well!
      things comes about. Can&rsquo;t you wait till she returns in due course, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This suggestion, the work of the pipe, did but bring on him another
      torrent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; said the farmer, putting the mouth of the pipe to his
      wrinkled-up temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard waited for him, and then he laid down the pipe altogether, as no
      aid in perplexity, and said, after leaning his arm on the table and
      staring at Richard an instant:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, young gentleman! My word&rsquo;s gone. I&rsquo;ve spoke it. I&rsquo;ve given &lsquo;em the
      &lsquo;surance she shan&rsquo;t be back till the Spring, and then I&rsquo;ll have her, and
      then&mdash;well! I do hope, for more reasons than one, ye&rsquo;ll both be wiser&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      got my own notions about her. But I an&rsquo;t the man to force a gal to marry
      &lsquo;gainst her inclines. Depend upon it I&rsquo;m not your enemy, Mr. Fev&rsquo;rel.
      You&rsquo;re jest the one to mak&rsquo; a young gal proud. So wait,&mdash;and see.
      That&rsquo;s my &lsquo;dvice. Jest tak&rsquo; and wait. I&rsquo;ve no more to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard&rsquo;s impetuosity had made him really afraid of speaking his notions
      concerning the projected felicity of young Tom, if indeed they were
      serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer repeated that he had no more to say; and Richard, with &ldquo;Wait
      till the Spring! Wait till the Spring!&rdquo; dinning despair in his ears, stood
      up to depart. Farmer Blaize shook his slack hand in a friendly way, and
      called out at the door for young Tom, who, dreading allusions to his
      Folly, did not appear. A maid rushed by Richard in the passage, and
      slipped something into his grasp, which fixed on it without further
      consciousness than that of touch. The mare was led forth by the Bantam. A
      light rain was falling down strong warm gusts, and the trees were noisy in
      the night. Farmer Blaize requested Richard at the gate to give him his
      hand, and say all was well. He liked the young man for his earnestness and
      honest outspeaking. Richard could not say all was well, but he gave his
      hand, and knitted it to the farmer&rsquo;s in a sharp squeeze, when he got upon
      Cassandra, and rode into the tumult.
    </p>
    <p>
      A calm, clear dawn succeeded the roaring West, and threw its glowing grey
      image on the waters of the Abbey-lake. Before sunrise Tom Bakewell was
      abroad, and met the missing youth, his master, jogging Cassandra leisurely
      along the Lobourne park-road, a sorry couple to look at. Cassandra&rsquo;s
      flanks were caked with mud, her head drooped: all that was in her had been
      taken out by that wild night. On what heaths and heavy fallows had she not
      spent her noble strength, recklessly fretting through the darkness!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the mare,&rdquo; said Richard, dismounting and patting her between the
      eyes. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s done up, poor old gal! Look to her, Tom, and then come to me
      in my room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom asked no questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days would bring the anniversary of Richard&rsquo;s birth, and though Tom
      was close, the condition of the mare, and the young gentleman&rsquo;s strange
      freak in riding her out all night becoming known, prepared everybody at
      Raynham for the usual bad-luck birthday, the prophets of which were full
      of sad gratification. Sir Austin had an unpleasant office to require of
      his son; no other than that of humbly begging Benson&rsquo;s pardon, and washing
      out the undue blood he had spilt in taking his Pound of Flesh. Heavy
      Benson was told to anticipate the demand for pardon, and practised in his
      mind the most melancholy Christian deportment he could assume on the
      occasion. But while his son was in this state, Sir Austin considered that
      he would hardly be brought to see the virtues of the act, and did not make
      the requisition of him, and heavy Benson remained drawn up solemnly
      expectant at doorways, and at the foot of the staircase, a Saurian
      Caryatid, wherever he could get a step in advance of the young man, while
      Richard heedlessly passed him, as he passed everybody else, his head bent
      to the ground, and his legs bearing him like random instruments of whose
      service he was unconscious. It was a shock to Benson&rsquo;s implicit belief in
      his patron; and he was not consoled by the philosophic explanation, &ldquo;That
      Good in a strong many-compounded nature is of slower growth than any other
      mortal thing, and must not be forced.&rdquo; Damnatory doctrines best pleased
      Benson. He was ready to pardon, as a Christian should, but he did want his
      enemy before him on his knees. And now, though the Saurian Eye saw more
      than all the other eyes in the house, and saw that there was matter in
      hand between Tom and his master to breed exceeding discomposure to the
      System, Benson, as he had not received his indemnity, and did not wish to
      encounter fresh perils for nothing, held his peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin partly divined what was going on in the breast of his son,
      without conceiving the depths of distrust his son cherished or quite
      measuring the intensity of the passion that consumed him. He was very kind
      and tender with him. Like a cunning physician who has, nevertheless,
      overlooked the change in the disease superinduced by one false dose, he
      meditated his prescriptions carefully and confidently, sure that he knew
      the case, and was a match for it. He decreed that Richard&rsquo;s erratic
      behaviour should pass unnoticed. Two days before the birthday, he asked
      him whether he would object to having company? To which Richard said:
      &ldquo;Have whom you will, sir.&rdquo; The preparation for festivity commenced
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the birthday eve he dined with the rest. Lady Blandish was there, and
      sat penitently at his right. Hippias prognosticated certain indigestion
      for himself on the morrow. The Eighteenth Century wondered whether she
      should live to see another birthday. Adrian drank the two-years&rsquo; distant
      term of his tutorship, and Algernon went over the list of the Lobourne men
      who would cope with Bursley on the morrow. Sir Austin gave ear and a word
      to all, keeping his mental eye for his son. To please Lady Blandish also,
      Adrian ventured to make trifling jokes about London&rsquo;s Mrs. Grandison;
      jokes delicately not decent, but so delicately so, that it was not decent
      to perceive it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner Richard left them. Nothing more than commonly peculiar was
      observed about him, beyond the excessive glitter of his eyes, but the
      baronet said, &ldquo;Yes, yes! that will pass.&rdquo; He and Adrian, and Lady
      Blandish, took tea in the library, and sat till a late hour discussing
      casuistries relating mostly to the Apple-disease. Converse very amusing to
      the wise youth, who could suggest to the two chaste minds situations of
      the shadiest character, with the air of a seeker after truth, and lead
      them, unsuspecting, where they dared not look about them. The Aphorist had
      elated the heart of his constant fair worshipper with a newly rounded if
      not newly conceived sentence, when they became aware that they were four.
      Heavy Benson stood among them. He said he had knocked, but received no
      answer. There was, however, a vestige of surprise and dissatisfaction on
      his face beholding Adrian of the company, which had not quite worn away,
      and gave place, when it did vanish, to an aspect of flabby severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Benson? well?&rdquo; said the baronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unmoving man replied: &ldquo;If you please, Sir Austin&mdash;Mr. Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Bakewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a carpet-bag!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carpet-bag might be supposed to contain that funny thing called a
      young hero&rsquo;s romance in the making.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out Richard was, and with a carpet-bag, which Tom Bakewell carried. He was
      on the road to Bellingham, under heavy rain, hasting like an escaped
      captive, wild with joy, while Tom shook his skin, and grunted at his
      discomforts. The mail train was to be caught at Bellingham. He knew where
      to find her now, through the intervention of Miss Davenport, and thither
      he was flying, an arrow loosed from the bow: thither, in spite of fathers
      and friends and plotters, to claim her, and take her, and stand with her
      against the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both thoroughly wet when they entered Bellingham, and Tom&rsquo;s
      visions were of hot drinks. He hinted the necessity for inward consolation
      to his master, who could answer nothing but &ldquo;Tom! Tom! I shall see her
      tomorrow!&rdquo; It was bad&mdash;travelling in the wet, Tom hinted again, to
      provoke the same insane outcry, and have his arm seized and furiously
      shaken into the bargain. Passing the principal inn of the place, Tom spoke
      plainly for brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Richard, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s not a moment to be lost!&rdquo; and as he said it,
      he reeled, and fell against Tom, muttering indistinctly of faintness, and
      that there was no time to lose. Tom lifted him in his arms, and got
      admission to the inn. Brandy, the country&rsquo;s specific, was advised by host
      and hostess, and forced into his mouth, reviving him sufficiently to cry
      out, &ldquo;Tom! the bell&rsquo;s ringing: we shall be late,&rdquo; after which he fell back
      insensible on the sofa where they had stretched him. Excitement of blood
      and brain had done its work upon him. The youth suffered them to undress
      him and put him to bed, and there he lay, forgetful even of love; a
      drowned weed borne onward by the tide of the hours. There his father found
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the Scientific Humanist remorseful? He had looked forward to such a
      crisis as that point in the disease his son was the victim of, when the
      body would fail and give the spirit calm to conquer the malady, knowing
      very well that the seeds of the evil were not of the spirit. Moreover, to
      see him and have him was a repose after the alarm Benson had sounded.
      &ldquo;Mark!&rdquo; he said to Lady Blandish, &ldquo;when he recovers he will not care for
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady had accompanied him to the Bellingham inn on first hearing of
      Richard&rsquo;s seizure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an iron man you can be,&rdquo; she exclaimed, smothering her intuitions.
      She was for giving the boy his bauble; promising it him, at least, if he
      would only get well and be the bright flower of promise he once was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you look on him,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;can you look on him and persevere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a hard sight for this man who loved his son so deeply. The youth
      lay in his strange bed, straight and motionless, with fever on his cheeks,
      and altered eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Dr. Clifford of Lobourne was the medical attendant, who, with
      head-shaking, and gathering of lips, and reminiscences of ancient
      arguments, guaranteed to do all that leech could do in the matter. The old
      doctor did admit that Richard&rsquo;s constitution was admirable, and answered
      to his prescriptions like a piano to the musician. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said at a
      family consultation, for Sir Austin had told him how it stood with the
      young man, &ldquo;drugs are not much in cases of this sort. Change! That&rsquo;s
      what&rsquo;s wanted, and as soon as may be. Distraction! He ought to see the
      world, and know what he is made of. It&rsquo;s no use my talking, I know,&rdquo; added
      the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said Sir Austin, &ldquo;I am quite of your persuasion. And
      the world he shall see&mdash;now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have dipped him in Styx, you know, doctor,&rdquo; Adrian remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, doctor,&rdquo; said Lady Blandish, &ldquo;have you known a case of this sort
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, my lady,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re not common in these parts.
      Country people are tolerably healthy-minded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But people&mdash;and country people&mdash;have died for love, doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor had not met any of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men, or women?&rdquo; inquired the baronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Blandish believed mostly women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask the doctor whether they were healthy-minded women,&rdquo; said the baronet.
      &ldquo;No! you are both looking at the wrong end. Between a highly-cultured
      being, and an emotionless animal, there is all the difference in the
      world. But of the two, the doctor is nearer the truth. The healthy nature
      is pretty safe. If he allowed for organization he would be right
      altogether. To feel, but not to feel to excess, that is the problem.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t have the one I chose,
     To some fresh maid I will propose,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Adrian hummed a country ballad.

      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the young Experiment again knew the hours that rolled him onward, he
      was in his own room at Raynham. Nothing had changed: only a strong fist
      had knocked him down and stunned him, and he opened his eyes to a grey
      world: he had forgotten what he lived for. He was weak and thin, and with
      a pale memory of things. His functions were the same, everything
      surrounding him was the same: he looked upon the old blue hills, the
      far-lying fallows, the river, and the woods: he knew them, they seemed to
      have lost recollection of him. Nor could he find in familiar human faces
      the secret of intimacy of heretofore. They were the same faces: they
      nodded and smiled to him. What was lost he could not tell. Something had
      been knocked out of him! He was sensible of his father&rsquo;s sweetness of
      manner, and he was grieved that he could not reply to it, for every sense
      of shame and reproach had strangely gone. He felt very useless. In place
      of the fiery love for one, he now bore about a cold charity to all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus in the heart of the young man died the Spring Primrose, and while it
      died another heart was pushing forth the Primrose of Autumn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wonderful change in Richard, and the wisdom of her admirer, now
      positively proved, were exciting matters to Lady Blandish. She was rebuked
      for certain little rebellious fancies concerning him that had come across
      her enslaved mind from time to time. For was he not almost a prophet? It
      distressed the sentimental lady that a love like Richard&rsquo;s could pass off
      in mere smoke, and words such as she had heard him speak in Abbey-wood
      resolve to emptiness. Nay, it humiliated her personally, and the baronet&rsquo;s
      shrewd prognostication humiliated her. For how should he know, and dare to
      say, that love was a thing of the dust that could be trodden out under the
      heel of science? But he had said so; and he had proved himself right. She
      heard with wonderment that Richard of his own accord had spoken to his
      father of the folly he had been guilty of, and had begged his pardon. The
      baronet told her this, adding that the youth had done it in a cold
      unwavering way, without a movement of his features: had evidently done it
      to throw off the burden of the duty, he had conceived. He had thought
      himself bound to acknowledge that he had been the Foolish Young Fellow,
      wishing, possibly, to abjure the fact by an set of penance. He had also
      given satisfaction to Benson, and was become a renovated peaceful spirit,
      whose main object appeared to be to get up his physical strength by
      exercise and no expenditure of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her company he was composed and courteous; even when they were alone
      together, he did not exhibit a trace of melancholy. Sober he seemed, as
      one who has recovered from a drunkenness and has determined to drink no
      more. The idea struck her that he might be playing a part, but Tom
      Bakewell, in a private conversation they had, informed her that he had
      received an order from his young master, one day while boxing with him,
      not to mention the young lady&rsquo;s name to him as long as he lived; and Tom
      could only suppose that she had offended him. Theoretically wise Lady
      Blandish had always thought the baronet; she was unprepared to find him
      thus practically sagacious. She fell many degrees; she wanted something to
      cling to; so she clung to the man who struck her low. Love, then, was
      earthly; its depth could be probed by science! A man lived who could
      measure it from end to end; foretell its term; handle the young cherub as
      were he a shot owl! We who have flown into cousinship with the empyrean,
      and disported among immortal hosts, our base birth as a child of Time is
      made bare to us!&mdash;our wings are cut! Oh, then, if science is this
      victorious enemy of love, let us love science! was the logic of the lady&rsquo;s
      heart; and secretly cherishing the assurance that she should confute him
      yet, and prove him utterly wrong, she gave him the fruits of present
      success, as it is a habit of women to do; involuntarily partly. The fires
      took hold of her. She felt soft emotions such as a girl feels, and they
      flattered her. It was like youth coming back. Pure women have a second
      youth. The Autumn primrose flourished.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are advised by The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip that&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ways of women, which are Involution, and their practices, which are
      Opposition, are generally best hit upon by guess work, and a bold word;&rdquo;&mdash;it
      being impossible to track them and hunt them down in the ordinary style.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that we may not ourselves become involved and opposed, let us each of
      us venture a guess and say a bold word as to how it came that the lady,
      who trusted love to be eternal, grovelled to him that shattered her tender
      faith, and loved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto it had been simply a sentimental dalliance, and gossips had
      maligned the lady. Just when the gossips grew tired of their slander, and
      inclined to look upon her charitably, she set about to deserve every word
      they had said of her; which may instruct us, if you please, that gossips
      have only to persist in lying to be crowned with verity, or that one has
      only to endure evil mouths for a period to gain impunity. She was always
      at the Abbey now. She was much closeted with the baronet. It seemed to be
      understood that she had taken Mrs. Doria&rsquo;s place. Benson in his misogynic
      soul perceived that she was taking Lady Feverel&rsquo;s: but any report
      circulated by Benson was sure to meet discredit, and drew the gossips upon
      himself; which made his meditations tragic. No sooner was one woman
      defeated than another took the field! The object of the System was no
      sooner safe than its great author was in danger!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think what has come to Benson&rdquo; he said to Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to have received a fresh legacy of several pounds of lead,&rdquo;
       returned the wise youth, and imitating Dr. Clifford&rsquo;s manner. &ldquo;Change is
      what he wants! distraction! send him to Wales for a month, sir, and let
      Richard go with him. The two victims of woman may do each other good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t do without him,&rdquo; said the baronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we must continue to have him on our shoulders all day, and on our
      chests all night!&rdquo; Adrian ejaculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think while he preserves this aspect we won&rsquo;t have him at the
      dinner-table,&rdquo; said the baronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian thought that would be a relief to their digestions; and added: &ldquo;You
      know, sir, what he says?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Receiving a negative, Adrian delicately explained to him that Benson&rsquo;s
      excessive ponderosity of demeanour was caused by anxiety for the safety of
      his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must pardon a faithful fool, sir,&rdquo; he continued, for the baronet
      became red, and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His stupidity is past belief! I have absolutely to bolt my study-door
      against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian at once beheld a charming scene in the interior of the study, not
      unlike one that Benson had visually witnessed. For, like a wary prophet,
      Benson, that he might have warrant for what he foretold of the future, had
      a care to spy upon the present: warned haply by The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip, of
      which he was a diligent reader, and which says, rather emphatically:
      &ldquo;Could we see Time&rsquo;s full face, we were wise of him.&rdquo; Now to see Time&rsquo;s
      full face, it is sometimes necessary to look through keyholes, the veteran
      having a trick of smiling peace to you on one cheek and grimacing
      confusion on the other behind the curtain. Decency and a sense of honour
      restrain most of us from being thus wise and miserable for ever. Benson&rsquo;s
      excuse was that he believed in his master, who was menaced. And moreover,
      notwithstanding his previous tribulation, to spy upon Cupid was sweet to
      him. So he peeped, and he saw a sight. He saw Time&rsquo;s full face; or, in
      other words, he saw the wiles of woman and the weakness of man: which is
      our history, as Benson would have written it, and a great many poets and
      philosophers have written it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was but the plucking of the Autumn primrose that Benson had seen: a
      somewhat different operation from the plucking of the Spring one: very
      innocent! Our staid elderly sister has paler blood, and has, or thinks she
      has, a reason or two about the roots. She is not all instinct. &ldquo;For this
      high cause, and for that I know men, and know him to be the flower of men,
      I give myself to him!&rdquo; She makes that lofty inward exclamation while the
      hand is detaching her from the roots. Even so strong a self-justification
      she requires. She has not that blind glory in excess which her younger
      sister can gild the longest leap with. And if, moth-like, she desires the
      star, she is nervously cautious of candles. Hence her circles about the
      dangerous human flame are wide and shy. She must be drawn nearer and
      nearer by a fresh reason. She loves to sentimentalize. Lady Blandish had
      been sentimentalizing for ten years. She would have preferred to pursue
      the game. The dark-eyed dame was pleased with her smooth life and the soft
      excitement that did not ruffle it. Not willingly did she let herself be
      won.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sentimentalists,&rdquo; says The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip, &ldquo;are they who seek to enjoy
      without incurring the Immense Debtorship for a thing done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; the writer says of Sentimentalism elsewhere, &ldquo;a happy pastime and
      an important science to the timid, the idle, and the heartless; but a
      damning one to them who have anything to forfeit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, one who could set down the dying for love, as a sentimentalism,
      can hardly be accepted as a clear authority. Assuredly he was not one to
      avoid the incurring of the immense debtorship in any way: but he was a
      bondsman still to the woman who had forsaken him, and a spoken word would
      have made it seem his duty to face that public scandal which was the last
      evil to him. What had so horrified the virtuous Benson, Richard had
      already beheld in Daphne&rsquo;s Bower; a simple kissing of the fair white hand!
      Doubtless the keyhole somehow added to Benson&rsquo;s horror. The two similar
      performances, so very innocent, had wondrous opposite consequences. The
      first kindled Richard to adore Woman; the second destroyed Benson&rsquo;s faith
      in Man. But Lady Blandish knew the difference between the two. She
      understood why the baronet did not speak; excused, and respected him for
      it. She was content, since she must love, to love humbly, and she had,
      besides, her pity for his sorrows to comfort her. A hundred fresh reasons
      for loving him arose and multiplied every day. He read to her the secret
      book in his own handwriting, composed for Richard&rsquo;s Marriage Guide:
      containing Advice and Directions to a Young Husband, full of the most
      tender wisdom and delicacy; so she thought; nay, not wanting in poetry,
      though neither rhymed nor measured. He expounded to her the distinctive
      character of the divers ages of love, giving the palm to the flower she
      put forth, over that of Spring, or the Summer rose. And while they sat and
      talked; &ldquo;My wound has healed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;At the fountain
      of your eyes,&rdquo; he replied, and drew the joy of new life from her blushes,
      without incurring further debtor ship for a thing done.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Let it be some apology for the damage caused by the careering hero, and a
      consolation to the quiet wretches, dragged along with him at his
      chariot-wheels, that he is generally the last to know when he has made an
      actual start; such a mere creature is he, like the rest of us, albeit the
      head of our fates. By this you perceive the true hero, whether he be a
      prince or a pot-boy, that he does not plot; Fortune does all for him. He
      may be compared to one to whom, in an electric circle, it is given to
      carry the battery.
    </p>
    <p>
      We caper and grimace at his will; yet not his the will, not his the power.
      &lsquo;Tis all Fortune&rsquo;s, whose puppet he is. She deals her dispensations
      through him. Yea, though our capers be never so comical, he laughs not.
      Intent upon his own business, the true hero asks little services of us
      here and there; thinks it quite natural that they should be acceded to,
      and sees nothing ridiculous in the lamentable contortions we must go
      through to fulfil them. Probably he is the elect of Fortune, because of
      that notable faculty of being intent upon his own business: &ldquo;Which is,&rdquo;
       says The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip, &ldquo;with men to be valued equal to that force which
      in water makes a stream.&rdquo; This prelude was necessary to the present
      chapter of Richard&rsquo;s history.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that in the turn of the year, and while old earth was busy
      with her flowers, the fresh wind blew, the little bird sang, and Hippias
      Feverel, the Dyspepsy, amazed, felt the Spring move within him. He
      communicated his delightful new sensations to the baronet, his brother,
      whose constant exclamation with regard to him, was: &ldquo;Poor Hippias! All his
      machinery is bare!&rdquo; and had no hope that he would ever be in a condition
      to defend it from view. Nevertheless Hippias had that hope, and so he told
      his brother, making great exposure of his machinery to effect the
      explanation. He spoke of all his physical experiences exultingly, and with
      wonder. The achievement of common efforts, not usually blazoned, he
      celebrated as triumphs, and, of course, had Adrian on his back very
      quickly. But he could bear him, or anything, now. It was such ineffable
      relief to find himself looking out upon the world of mortals instead of
      into the black phantasmal abysses of his own complicated frightful
      structure. &ldquo;My mind doesn&rsquo;t so much seem to haunt itself, now,&rdquo; said
      Hippias, nodding shortly and peering out of intense puckers to convey a
      glimpse of what hellish sufferings his had been: &ldquo;I feel as if I had come
      aboveground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A poor Dyspepsy may talk as he will, but he is the one who never gets
      sympathy, or experiences compassion: and it is he whose groaning petitions
      for charity do at last rout that Christian virtue. Lady Blandish, a
      charitable soul, could not listen to Hippias, though she had a heart for
      little mice and flies, and Sir Austin had also small patience with his
      brother&rsquo;s gleam of health, which was just enough to make his disease
      visible. He remembered his early follies and excesses, and bent his ear to
      him as one man does to another who complains of having to pay a debt
      legally incurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Adrian, seeing how the communications of Hippias were
      received, &ldquo;that when our Nemesis takes lodgings in the stomach, it&rsquo;s best
      to act the Spartan, smile hard, and be silent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard alone was decently kind to Hippias; whether from opposition, or
      real affection, could not be said, as the young man was mysterious. He
      advised his uncle to take exercise, walked with him, cultivated cheerful
      impressions in him, and pointed out innocent pursuits. He made Hippias
      visit with him some of the poor old folk of the village, who bewailed the
      loss of his cousin Austin Wentworth, and did his best to waken him up, and
      give the outer world a stronger hold on him. He succeeded in nothing but
      in winning his uncle&rsquo;s gratitude. The season bloomed scarce longer than a
      week for Hippias, and then began to languish. The poor Dyspepsy&rsquo;s eager
      grasp at beatification relaxed: he went underground again. He announced
      that he felt &ldquo;spongy things&rdquo;&mdash;one of the more constant throes of his
      malady. His bitter face recurred: he chewed the cud of horrid
      hallucinations. He told Richard he must give up going about with him:
      people telling of their ailments made him so uncomfortable&mdash;the birds
      were so noisy, pairing&mdash;the rude bare soil sickened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard treated him with a gravity equal to his father&rsquo;s. He asked what
      the doctors said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the doctors!&rdquo; cried Hippias with vehement scepticism. &ldquo;No man of
      sense believes in medicine for chronic disorder. Do you happen to have
      heard of any new remedy then, Richard? No? They advertise a great many
      cures for indigestion, I assure you, my dear boy. I wonder whether one can
      rely upon the authenticity of those signatures? I see no reason why there
      should be no cure for such a disease?&mdash;Eh? And it&rsquo;s just one of the
      things a quack, as they call them, would hit upon sooner than one who is
      in the beaten track. Do you know, Richard, my dear boy, I&rsquo;ve often thought
      that if we could by any means appropriate to our use some of the
      extraordinary digestive power that a boa constrictor has in his gastric
      juices, there is really no manner of reason why we should not comfortably
      dispose of as much of an ox as our stomachs will hold, and one might eat
      French dishes without the wretchedness of thinking what&rsquo;s to follow. And
      this makes me think that those fellows may, after all, have got some truth
      in them: some secret that, of course, they require to be paid for. We
      distrust each other in this world too much, Richard. I&rsquo;ve felt inclined
      once or twice&mdash;but it&rsquo;s absurd!&mdash;If it only alleviated a few of
      my sufferings I should be satisfied. I&rsquo;ve no hesitation in saying that I
      should be quite satisfied if it only did away with one or two, and left me
      free to eat and drink as other people do. Not that I mean to try them.
      It&rsquo;s only a fancy&mdash;Eh? What a thing health is, my dear boy! Ah! if I
      were like you! I was in love once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you!&rdquo; said Richard, coolly regarding him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forgotten what I felt!&rdquo; Hippias sighed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve very much improved,
      my dear boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So people say,&rdquo; quoth Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippias looked at him anxiously: &ldquo;If I go to town and get the doctor&rsquo;s
      opinion about trying a new course&mdash;Eh, Richard? will you come with
      me? I should like your company. We could see London together, you know.
      Enjoy ourselves,&rdquo; and Hippias rubbed his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard smiled at the feeble glimmer of enjoyment promised by his uncle&rsquo;s
      eyes, and said he thought it better they should stay where they were&mdash;an
      answer that might mean anything. Hippias immediately became possessed by
      the beguiling project. He went to the baronet, and put the matter before
      him, instancing doctors as the object of his journey, not quacks, of
      course; and requesting leave to take Richard. Sir Austin was getting
      uneasy about his son&rsquo;s manner. It was not natural. His heart seemed to be
      frozen: he had no confidences: he appeared to have no ambition&mdash;to
      have lost the virtues of youth with the poison that had passed out of him.
      He was disposed to try what effect a little travelling might have on him,
      and had himself once or twice hinted to Richard that it would be good for
      him to move about, the young man quietly replying that he did not wish to
      quit Raynham at all, which was too strict a fulfilment of his father&rsquo;s
      original views in educating him there entirely. On the day that Hippias
      made his proposal, Adrian, seconded by Lady Blandish, also made one. The
      sweet Spring season stirred in Adrian as well as in others: not to
      pastoral measures: to the joys of the operatic world and bravura glories.
      He also suggested that it would be advisable to carry Richard to town for
      a term, and let him know his position, and some freedom. Sir Austin
      weighed the two proposals. He was pretty certain that Richard&rsquo;s passion
      was consumed, and that the youth was now only under the burden of its
      ashes. He had found against his heart, at the Bellingham inn: a great lock
      of golden hair. He had taken it, and the lover, after feeling about for it
      with faint hands, never asked for it. This precious lock (Miss Davenport
      had thrust it into his hand at Belthorpe as Lucy&rsquo;s last gift), what sighs
      and tears it had weathered! The baronet laid it in Richard&rsquo;s sight one
      day, and beheld him take it up, turn it over, and drop it down again
      calmly, as if he were handling any common curiosity. It pacified him on
      that score. The young man&rsquo;s love was dead. Dr. Clifford said rightly: he
      wanted distractions. The baronet determined that Richard should go.
      Hippias and Adrian then pressed their several suits as to which should
      have him. Hippias, when he could forget himself, did not lack sense. He
      observed that Adrian was not at present a proper companion for Richard,
      and would teach him to look on life from the false point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand a young philosopher,&rdquo; said the baronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young philosopher&rsquo;s an old fool!&rdquo; returned Hippias, not thinking that
      his growl had begotten a phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      His brother smiled with gratification, and applauded him loudly:
      &ldquo;Excellent! worthy of your best days! You&rsquo;re wrong, though, in applying it
      to Adrian. He has never been precocious. All he has done has been to bring
      sound common sense to bear upon what he hears and sees. I think, however,&rdquo;
       the baronet added, &ldquo;he may want faith in the better qualities of men.&rdquo; And
      this reflection inclined him not to let his son be alone with Adrian. He
      gave Richard his choice, who saw which way his father&rsquo;s wishes tended, and
      decided so to please him. Naturally it annoyed Adrian extremely. He said
      to his chief:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you know what you are doing, sir. I don&rsquo;t see that we derive
      any advantage from the family name being made notorious for twenty years
      of obscene suffering, and becoming a byword for our constitutional
      tendency to stomachic distension before we fortunately encountered
      Quackem&rsquo;s Pill. My uncle&rsquo;s tortures have been huge, but I would rather
      society were not intimate with them under their several headings.&rdquo; Adrian
      enumerated some of the most abhorrent. &ldquo;You know him, sir. If he conceives
      a duty, he will do it in the face of every decency&mdash;all the more
      obstinate because the conception is rare. If he feels a little brisk the
      morning after the pill, he sends the letter that makes us famous! We go
      down to posterity with heightened characteristics, to say nothing of a
      contemporary celebrity nothing less than our being turned inside-out to
      the rabble. I confess I don&rsquo;t desire to have my machinery made bare to
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin assured the wise youth that Hippias had arranged to go to Dr.
      Bairam. He softened Adrian&rsquo;s chagrin by telling him that in about two
      weeks they would follow to London: hinting also at a prospective Summer
      campaign. The day was fixed for Richard to depart, and the day came.
      Madame the Eighteenth Century called him to her chamber and put into his
      hand a fifty-pound note, as her contribution toward his pocket-expenses.
      He did not want it, he said, but she told him he was a young man, and
      would soon make that fly when he stood on his own feet. The old lady did
      not at all approve of the System in her heart, and she gave her
      grandnephew to understand that, should he require more, he knew where to
      apply, and secrets would be kept. His father presented him with a hundred
      pounds&mdash;which also Richard said he did not want&mdash;he did not care
      for money. &ldquo;Spend it or not,&rdquo; said the baronet, perfectly secure in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippias had few injunctions to observe. They were to take up quarters at
      the hotel, Algernon&rsquo;s general run of company at the house not being
      altogether wholesome. The baronet particularly forewarned Hippias of the
      imprudence of attempting to restrict the young man&rsquo;s movements, and
      letting him imagine he was under surveillance. Richard having been, as it
      were, pollarded by despotism, was now to grow up straight, and bloom
      again, in complete independence, as far as he could feel. So did the sage
      decree; and we may pause a moment to reflect how wise were his previsions,
      and how successful they must have been, had not Fortune, the great foe to
      human cleverness, turned against him, or he against himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The departure took place on a fine March morning. The bird of Winter sang
      from the budding tree; in the blue sky sang the bird of Summer. Adrian
      rode between Richard and Hippias to the Bellingham station, and vented his
      disgust on them after his own humorous fashion, because it did not rain
      and damp their ardour. In the rear came Lady Blandish and the baronet,
      conversing on the calm summit of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have shaped him exactly to resemble yourself,&rdquo; she said, pointing
      with her riding-whip to the grave stately figure of the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Outwardly, perhaps,&rdquo; he answered, and led to a discussion on Purity and
      Strength, the lady saying that she preferred Purity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you do not,&rdquo; said the baronet. &ldquo;And there I admire the always true
      instinct of women, that they all worship Strength in whatever form, and
      seem to know it to be the child of heaven; whereas Purity is but a
      characteristic, a garment, and can be spotted&mdash;how soon! For there
      are questions in this life with which we must grapple or be lost, and
      when, hunted by that cold eye of intense inner-consciousness, the clearest
      soul becomes a cunning fox, if it have not courage to stand and do battle.
      Strength indicates a boundless nature&mdash;like the Maker. Strength is a
      God to you&mdash;Purity a toy. A pretty one, and you seem to be fond of
      playing with it,&rdquo; he added, with unaccustomed slyness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady listened, pleased at the sportive malice which showed that the
      constraint on his mind had left him. It was for women to fight their fight
      now; she only took part in it for amusement. This is how the ranks of our
      enemies are thinned; no sooner do poor women put up a champion in their
      midst than she betrays them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she said archly, &ldquo;we are the lovelier vessels; you claim the more
      direct descent. Men are seedlings: Women&mdash;slips! Nay, you have said
      so,&rdquo; she cried out at his gestured protestation, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I never printed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what you speak answers for print with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Exquisite Blandish! He could not choose but love her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what are your plans?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;May a woman know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He replied, &ldquo;I have none or you would share them. I shall study him in the
      world. This indifference must wear off. I shall mark his inclinations now,
      and he shall be what he inclines to. Occupation will be his prime safety.
      His cousin Austin&rsquo;s plan of life appears most to his taste, and he can
      serve the people that way as well as in Parliament, should he have no
      stronger ambition. The clear duty of a man of any wealth is to serve the
      people as he best can. He shall go among Austin&rsquo;s set, if he wishes it,
      though personally I find no pleasure in rash imaginations, and undigested
      schemes built upon the mere instinct of principles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at him now,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;He seems to care for nothing; not even
      for the beauty of the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or Adrian&rsquo;s jokes,&rdquo; added the baronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian could be seen to be trying zealously to torment a laugh, or a
      confession of irritation, out of his hearers, stretching out his chin to
      one, and to the other, with audible asides. Richard he treated as a new
      instrument of destruction about to be let loose on the slumbering
      metropolis; Hippias as one in an interesting condition; and he got so much
      fun out of the notion of these two journeying together, and the mishaps
      that might occur to them, that he esteemed it almost a personal insult for
      his hearers not to laugh. The wise youth&rsquo;s dull life at Raynham had
      afflicted him with many peculiarities of the professional joker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the Spring! the Spring!&rdquo; he cried, as in scorn of his sallies they
      exchanged their unmeaning remarks on the sweet weather across him. &ldquo;You
      seem both to be uncommonly excited by the operations of turtles, rooks,
      and daws. Why can&rsquo;t you let them alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &lsquo;Wind bloweth,
          Cock croweth,
             Doodle-doo;
          Hippy verteth,
          Ricky sterteth,
             Sing Cuckoo!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      There&rsquo;s an old native pastoral!&mdash;Why don&rsquo;t you write a Spring sonnet,
      Ricky? The asparagus-beds are full of promise, I hear, and eke the
      strawberry. Berries I fancy your Pegasus has a taste for. What kind of
      berry was that I saw some verses of yours about once?&mdash;amatory verses
      to some kind of berry&mdash;yewberry, blueberry, glueberry! Pretty verses,
      decidedly warm. Lips, eyes, bosom, legs&mdash;legs? I don&rsquo;t think you gave
      her any legs. No legs and no nose. That appears to be the poetic taste of
      the day. It shall be admitted that you create the very beauties for a
      chaste people.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;O might I lie where leans her lute!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      and offend no moral community. That&rsquo;s not a bad image of yours, my dear
      boy:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &lsquo;Her shape is like an antelope
        Upon the Eastern hills.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      But as a candid critic, I would ask you if the likeness can be considered
      correct when you give her no legs? You will see at the ballet that you are
      in error about women at present, Richard. That admirable institution which
      our venerable elders have imported from Gallia for the instruction of our
      gaping youth, will edify and astonish you. I assure you I used, from
      reading The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip, to imagine all sorts of things about them,
      till I was taken there, and learnt that they are very like us after all,
      and then they ceased to trouble me. Mystery is the great danger to youth,
      my son! Mystery is woman&rsquo;s redoubtable weapon, O Richard of the Ordeal!
      I&rsquo;m aware that you&rsquo;ve had your lessons in anatomy, but nothing will
      persuade you that an anatomical figure means flesh and blood. You can&rsquo;t
      realize the fact. Do you intend to publish when you&rsquo;re in town? It&rsquo;ll be
      better not to put your name. Having one&rsquo;s name to a volume of poems is as
      bad as to an advertising pill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send you an early copy, Adrian, when I publish,&rdquo; quoth Richard.
      &ldquo;Hark at that old blackbird, uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Hippias quavered; looking up from the usual subject of his
      contemplation, and trying to take an interest in him, &ldquo;fine old fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a chuckle he gives out before he flies! Not unlike July
      nightingales. You know that bird I told you of&mdash;the blackbird that
      had its mate shot, and used to come to sing to old Dame Bakewell&rsquo;s bird
      from the tree opposite. A rascal knocked it over the day before yesterday,
      and the dame says her bird hasn&rsquo;t sung a note since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extraordinary!&rdquo; Hippias muttered abstractedly. &ldquo;I remember the verses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where&rsquo;s your moral?&rdquo; interposed the wrathful Adrian. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
      constancy rewarded?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &lsquo;The ouzel-cock so black of hue,
        With orange-tawny bill;
        The rascal with his aim so true;
        The Poet&rsquo;s little quill!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the moral of that? except that all&rsquo;s game to the poet! Certainly
      we have a noble example of the devotedness of the female, who for three
      entire days refuses to make herself heard, on account of a defunct male. I
      suppose that&rsquo;s what Ricky dwells on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please, my dear Adrian,&rdquo; says Richard, and points out larch-buds
      to his uncle, as they ride by the young green wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wise youth was driven to extremity. Such a lapse from his pupil&rsquo;s
      heroics to this last verge of Arcadian coolness, Adrian could not believe
      in. &ldquo;Hark at this old blackbird!&rdquo; he cried, in his turn, and pretending to
      interpret his fits of song:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a pretty comedy!&mdash;Don&rsquo;t we wear the mask well, my Fiesco?&mdash;Genoa
      will be our own to-morrow!&mdash;Only wait until the train has started&mdash;jolly!
      jolly! jolly! We&rsquo;ll be winners yet!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bad verse&mdash;eh, Ricky? my Lucius Junius!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do the blackbird well,&rdquo; said Richard, and looked at him in a manner
      mildly affable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian shrugged. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a young man of wonderful powers,&rdquo; he emphatically
      observed; meaning to say that Richard quite beat him; for which opinion
      Richard gravely thanked him, and with this they rode into Bellingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was young Tom Blaize at the station, in his Sunday beaver and gala
      waistcoat and neckcloth, coming the lord over Tom Bakewell, who had
      preceded his master in charge of the baggage. He likewise was bound for
      London. Richard, as he was dismounting, heard Adrian say to the baronet:
      &ldquo;The Beast, sir, appears to be going to fetch Beauty;&rdquo; but he paid no heed
      to the words. Whether young Tom heard them or not, Adrian&rsquo;s look took the
      lord out of him, and he shrunk away into obscurity, where the nearest
      approach to the fashions which the tailors of Bellingham could supply to
      him, sat upon him more easily, and he was not stiffened by the eyes of the
      superiors whom he sought to rival. The baronet, Lady Blandish, and Adrian
      remained on horseback, and received Richard&rsquo;s adieux across the palings.
      He shook hands with each of them in the same kindly cold way, elicitating
      from Adrian a marked encomium on his style of doing it. The train came up,
      and Richard stepped after his uncle into one of the carriages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now surely there will come an age when the presentation of science at war
      with Fortune and the Fates, will be deemed the true epic of modern life;
      and the aspect of a scientific humanist who, by dint of incessant
      watchfulness, has maintained a System against those active forties, cannot
      be reckoned less than sublime, even though at the moment he but sit upon
      his horse, on a fine March morning such as this, and smile wistfully to
      behold the son of his heart, his System incarnate, wave a serene adieu to
      tutelage, neither too eager nor morbidly unwilling to try his luck alone
      for a term of two weeks. At present, I am aware, an audience impatient for
      blood and glory scorns the stress I am putting on incidents so minute, a
      picture so little imposing. An audience will come to whom it will be given
      to see the elementary machinery at work: who, as it were, from some slight
      hint of the straws, will feel the winds of March when they do not blow. To
      them will nothing be trivial, seeing that they will have in their eyes the
      invisible conflict going on around us, whose features a nod, a smile, a
      laugh of ours perpetually changes. And they will perceive, moreover, that
      in real life all hangs together: the train is laid in the lifting of an
      eyebrow, that bursts upon the field of thousands. They will see the links
      of things as they pass, and wonder not, as foolish people now do, that
      this great matter came out of that small one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such an audience, then, will participate in the baronet&rsquo;s gratification at
      his son&rsquo;s demeanour, wherein he noted the calm bearing of experience not
      gained in the usual wanton way: and will not be without some excited
      apprehension at his twinge of astonishment, when, just as the train went
      sliding into swiftness, he beheld the grave, cold, self-possessed young
      man throw himself back in the carriage violently laughing. Science was at
      a loss to account for that. Sir Austin checked his mind from inquiring,
      that he might keep suspicion at a distance, but he thought it odd, and the
      jarring sensation that ran along his nerves at the sight, remained with
      him as he rode home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Blandish&rsquo;s tender womanly intuition bade her say: &ldquo;You see it was the
      very thing he wanted. He has got his natural spirits already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was,&rdquo; Adrian put in his word, &ldquo;the exact thing he wanted. His spirits
      have returned miraculously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something amused him,&rdquo; said the baronet, with an eye on the puffing
      train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably something his uncle said or did,&rdquo; Lady Blandish suggested, and
      led off at a gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her conjecture chanced to be quite correct. The cause for Richard&rsquo;s
      laughter was simple enough. Hippias, on finding the carriage-door closed
      on him, became all at once aware of the bright-haired hope which dwells in
      Change; for one who does not woo her too frequently; and to express his
      sudden relief from mental despondency at the amorous prospect, the
      Dyspepsy bent and gave his hands a sharp rub between his legs: which
      unlucky action brought Adrian&rsquo;s pastoral,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Hippy verteth,
          Sing cuckoo!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      in such comic colours before Richard, that a demon of laughter seized him.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Hippy verteth!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Every time he glanced at his uncle the song sprang up, and he laughed so
      immoderately that it looked like madness come upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, why, why, what are you laughing at, my dear boy,&rdquo; said Hippias, and
      was provoked by the contagious exercise to a modest &ldquo;ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what are you laughing at, uncle?&rdquo; cried Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Hippias chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I, uncle! Sing, cuckoo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They laughed themselves into the pleasantest mood imaginable. Hippias not
      only came aboveground, he flew about in the very skies, verting like any
      blithe creature of the season. He remembered old legal jokes, and
      anecdotes of Circuit; and Richard laughed at them all, but more at him&mdash;he
      was so genial, and childishly fresh, and innocently joyful at his own
      transformation, while a lurking doubt in the bottom of his eyes, now and
      then, that it might not last, and that he must go underground again, lent
      him a look of pathos and humour which tickled his youthful companion
      irresistibly, and made his heart warm to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what, uncle,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;I think travelling&rsquo;s a capital
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best thing in the world, my dear boy,&rdquo; Hippias returned. &ldquo;It makes me
      wish I had given up that Work of mine, and tried it before, instead of
      chaining myself to a task. We&rsquo;re quite different beings in a minute. I am.
      Hem! what shall we have for dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave that to me, uncle. I shall order for you. You know, I intend to
      make you well. How gloriously we go along! I should like to ride on a
      railway every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hippias remarked: &ldquo;They say it rather injures the digestion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! see how you&rsquo;ll digest to-night and to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I shall do something yet,&rdquo; sighed Hippias, alluding to the vast
      literary fame he had aforetime dreamed of. &ldquo;I hope I shall have a good
      night to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you will! What! after laughing like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; Hippias grunted, &ldquo;I daresay, Richard, you sleep the moment you get
      into bed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The instant my head&rsquo;s on my pillow, and up the moment I wake. Health&rsquo;s
      everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Health&rsquo;s everything!&rdquo; echoed Hippias, from his immense distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you&rsquo;ll put yourself in my hands,&rdquo; Richard continued, &ldquo;you shall do
      just as I do. You shall be well and strong, and sing &lsquo;Jolly!&rsquo; like
      Adrian&rsquo;s blackbird. You shall, upon my honour, uncle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He specified the hours of devotion to his uncle&rsquo;s recovery&mdash;no less
      than twelve a day&mdash;that he intended to expend, and his cheery
      robustness almost won his uncle to leap up recklessly and clutch health as
      his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; quoth Hippias, with a half-seduced smile, &ldquo;mind your dishes are
      not too savoury!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Light food and claret! Regular meals and amusement! Lend your heart to
      all, but give it to none!&rdquo; exclaims young Wisdom, and Hippias mutters,
      &ldquo;Yes! yes!&rdquo; and intimates that the origin of his malady lay in his not
      following that maxim earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love ruins us, my dear boy,&rdquo; he said, thinking to preach Richard a
      lesson, and Richard boisterously broke out:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;The love of Monsieur Francatelli,
        It was the ruin of&mdash;et coetera.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Hippias blinked, exclaiming, &ldquo;Really, my dear boy! I never saw you so
      excited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the railway! It&rsquo;s the fun, uncle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Hippias wagged a melancholy head, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got the Golden Bride! Keep
      her if you can. That&rsquo;s a pretty fable of your father&rsquo;s. I gave him the
      idea, though. Austin filches a great many of my ideas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the idea in verse, uncle:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &lsquo;O sunless walkers by the tide!
        O have you seen the Golden Bride!
        They say that she is fair beyond
        All women; faithful, and more fond!
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, the young inquirer comes to a group of penitent sinners by the
      brink of a stream. They howl, and answer:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        Faithful she is, but she forsakes:
        And fond, yet endless woe she makes:
        And fair! but with this curse she&rsquo;s cross&rsquo;d;
        To know her not till she is lost!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the doleful party march off in single file solemnly, and the
      fabulist pursues:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &lsquo;She hath a palace in the West:
        Bright Hesper lights her to her rest:
        And him the Morning Star awakes
        Whom to her charmed arms she takes.

        So lives he till he sees, alas!
        The maids of baser metal pass.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And prodigal of the happiness she lends him, he asks to share it with one
      of them. There is the Silver Maid, and the Copper, and the Brassy Maid,
      and others of them. First, you know, he tries Argentine, and finds her
      only twenty to the pound, and has a worse experience with Copperina, till
      he descends to the scullery; and the lower he goes, the less obscure
      become the features of his Bride of Gold, and all her radiance shines
      forth, my uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verse rather blunts the point. Well, keep to her, now you&rsquo;ve got her,&rdquo;
       says Hippias.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will, uncle!&mdash;Look how the farms fly past! Look at the cattle in
      the fields! And how the lines duck, and swim up!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;She claims the whole, and not the part&mdash;
     The coin of an unused heart!
     To gain his Golden Bride again,
     He hunts with melancholy men,&rsquo; 
     &mdash;and is waked no longer by the Morning Star!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if he doesn&rsquo;t sleep till an hour before it rises!&rdquo; Hippias
      interjected. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t rhyme badly. But stick to prose. Poetry&rsquo;s a
      Base-metal maid. I&rsquo;m not sure that any writing&rsquo;s good for the digestion.
      I&rsquo;m afraid it has spoilt mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear nothing, uncle!&rdquo; laughed Richard. &ldquo;You shall ride in the park with
      me every day to get an appetite. You and I and the Golden Bride. You know
      that little poem of Sandoe&rsquo;s?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;She rides in the park on a prancing bay,
      She and her squires together;
     Her dark locks gleam from a bonnet of grey,
      And toss with the tossing feather.

     &lsquo;Too calmly proud for a glance of pride
      Is the beautiful face as it passes;
     The cockneys nod to each other aside,
      The coxcombs lift their glasses.

     &lsquo;And throng to her, sigh to her, you that can breach
      The ice-wall that guards her securely;
     You have not such bliss, though she smile on you each,
      As the heart that can image her purely.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t Sandoe once a friend of my father&rsquo;s? I suppose they quarrelled. He
      understands the heart. What does he make his &lsquo;Humble Lover&rsquo; say?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;True, Madam, you may think to part
      Conditions by a glacier-ridge,
     But Beauty&rsquo;s for the largest heart,
      And all abysses Love can bridge!
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hippias now laughed; grimly, as men laugh at the emptiness of words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Largest heart!&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a &lsquo;glacier-ridge&rsquo;? I&rsquo;ve never seen
      one. I can&rsquo;t deny it rhymes with &lsquo;bridge.&rsquo; But don&rsquo;t go parading your
      admiration of that person, Richard. Your father will speak to you on the
      subject when he thinks fit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought they had quarrelled,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo; and he
      murmured to a pleased ear:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;Beauty&rsquo;s for the largest heart!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The flow of their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of
      passengers at a station. Richard examined their faces with pleasure. All
      faces pleased him. Human nature sat tributary at the feet of him and his
      Golden Bride. As he could not well talk his thoughts before them, he
      looked out at the windows, and enjoyed the changing landscape, projecting
      all sorts of delights for his old friend Ripton, and musing hazily on the
      wondrous things he was to do in the world; of the great service he was to
      be to his fellow-creatures. In the midst of his reveries he was landed in
      London. Tom Bakewell stood at the carriage door. A glance told Richard
      that his squire had something curious on his mind; and he gave Tom the
      word to speak out. Tom edged his master out of hearing, and began
      sputtering a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dash&rsquo;d if I can help it, sir!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That young Tom! He&rsquo;ve come to
      town dressed that spicy! and he don&rsquo;t know his way about no more than a
      stag. He&rsquo;s come to fetch somebody from another rail, and he don&rsquo;t know how
      to get there, and he ain&rsquo;t sure about which rail &lsquo;tis. Look at him, Mr.
      Richard! There he goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Tom appeared to have the weight of all London on his beaver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has he come for?&rdquo; Richard asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know, sir? You don&rsquo;t like me to mention the name,&rdquo; mumbled Tom,
      bursting to be perfectly intelligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it for her, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Lucy, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard turned away, and was seized by Hippias, who begged him to get out
      of the noise and pother, and caught hold of his slack arm to bear him into
      a conveyance; but Richard, by wheeling half to the right, or left, always
      got his face round to the point where young Tom was manoeuvring to appear
      at his ease. Even when they were seated in the conveyance, Hippias could
      not persuade him to drive off. He made the excuse that he did not wish to
      start till there was a clear road. At last young Tom cast anchor by a
      policeman, and, doubtless at the official&rsquo;s suggestion, bashfully took
      seat in a cab, and was shot into the whirlpool of London. Richard then
      angrily asked his driver what he was waiting for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ill, my boy?&rdquo; said Hippias. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your colour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed oddly, and made a random answer that he hoped the fellow would
      drive fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate slow motion after being in the railway,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippias assured him there was something the matter with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, uncle! nothing!&rdquo; said Richard, looking fiercely candid.
    </p>
    <p>
      They say, that when the skill and care of men rescue a drowned wretch from
      extinction, and warm the flickering spirit into steady flame, such pain it
      is, the blood forcing its way along the dry channels, and the
      heavily-ticking nerves, and the sullen heart&mdash;the struggle of life
      and death in him&mdash;grim death relaxing his gripe; such pain it is, he
      cries out no thanks to them that pull him by inches from the depths of the
      dead river. And he who has thought a love extinct, and is surprised by the
      old fires, and the old tyranny, he rebels, and strives to fight clear of
      the cloud of forgotten sensations that settle on him; such pain it is, the
      old sweet music reviving through his frame, and the charm of his passion
      filing him afresh. Still was fair Lucy the one woman to Richard. He had
      forbidden her name but from an instinct of self-defence. Must the maids of
      baser metal dominate him anew, it is in Lucy&rsquo;s shape. Thinking of her now
      so near him&mdash;his darling! all her graces, her sweetness, her truth;
      for, despite his bitter blame of her, he knew her true&mdash;swam in a
      thousand visions before his eyes; visions pathetic, and full of glory,
      that now wrung his heart, and now elated it. As well might a ship attempt
      to calm the sea, as this young man the violent emotion that began to rage
      in his breast. &ldquo;I shall not see her!&rdquo; he said to himself exultingly, and
      at the same instant thought, how black was every corner of the earth but
      that one spot where Lucy stood! how utterly cheerless the place he was
      going to! Then he determined to bear it; to live in darkness; there was a
      refuge in the idea of a voluntary martyrdom. &ldquo;For if I chose I could see
      her&mdash;this day within an hour!&mdash;I could see her, and touch her
      hand, and, oh, heaven!&mdash;But I do not choose.&rdquo; And a great wave
      swelled through him, and was crushed down only to swell again more
      stormily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Tom Bakewell&rsquo;s words recurred to him that young Tom Blaize was
      uncertain where to go for her, and that she might be thrown on this
      Babylon alone. And flying from point to point, it struck him that they had
      known at Raynham of her return, and had sent him to town to be out of the
      way&mdash;they had been miserably plotting against him once more. &ldquo;They
      shall see what right they have to fear me. I&rsquo;ll shame them!&rdquo; was the first
      turn taken by his wrathful feelings, as he resolved to go, and see her
      safe, and calmly return to his uncle, whom he sincerely believed not to be
      one of the conspirators. Nevertheless, after forming that resolve, he sat
      still, as if there were something fatal in the wheels that bore him away
      from it&mdash;perhaps because he knew, as some do when passion is lord,
      that his intelligence juggled with him; though none the less keenly did he
      feel his wrongs and suspicions. His Golden Bride was waning fast. But when
      Hippias ejaculated to cheer him: &ldquo;We shall soon be there!&rdquo; the spell
      broke. Richard stopped the cab, saying he wanted to speak to Tom, and
      would ride with him the rest of the journey. He knew well enough which
      line of railway his Lucy must come by. He had studied every town and
      station on the line. Before his uncle could express more than a mute
      remonstrance, he jumped out and hailed Tom Bakewell, who came behind with
      the boxes and baggage in a companion cab, his head a yard beyond the
      window to make sure of his ark of safety, the vehicle preceding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an extraordinary, impetuous boy it is,&rdquo; said Hippias. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the
      very street!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Within a minute the stalwart Berry, despatched by the baronet to arrange
      everything for their comfort, had opened the door, and made his bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Richard, sir?&mdash;evaporated?&rdquo; was Berry&rsquo;s modulated inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behind&mdash;among the boxes, fool!&rdquo; Hippias growled, as he received
      Berry&rsquo;s muscular assistance to alight. &ldquo;Lunch ready&mdash;eh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luncheon was ordered precise at two o&rsquo;clock, sir&mdash;been in attendance
      one quarter of an hour. Heah!&rdquo; Berry sang out to the second cab, which,
      with its pyramid of luggage, remained stationary some thirty paces
      distant. At his voice the majestic pile deliberately turned its back on
      them, and went off in a contrary direction.

      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the stroke of the hour when Ripton Thompson was accustomed to consult
      his gold watch for practical purposes, and sniff freedom and the
      forthcoming dinner, a burglarious foot entered the clerk&rsquo;s office where he
      sat, and a man of a scowling countenance, who looked a villain, and whom
      he was afraid he knew, slid a letter into his hands, nodding that it would
      be prudent for him to read, and be silent. Ripton obeyed in alarm.
      Apparently the contents of the letter relieved his conscience; for he
      reached down his hat, and told Mr. Beazley to inform his father that he
      had business of pressing importance in the West, and should meet him at
      the station. Mr. Beazley zealously waited upon the paternal Thompson
      without delay, and together making their observations from the window,
      they beheld a cab of many boxes, into which Ripton darted and was followed
      by one in groom&rsquo;s dress. It was Saturday, the day when Ripton gave up his
      law-readings, magnanimously to bestow himself upon his family, and Mr.
      Thompson liked to have his son&rsquo;s arm as he walked down to the station; but
      that third glass of Port which always stood for his second, and the
      groom&rsquo;s suggestion of aristocratic acquaintances, prevented Mr. Thompson
      from interfering: so Ripton was permitted to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the cab Ripton made a study of the letter he held. It had the
      preciseness of an imperial mandate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Ripton,&mdash;You are to get lodgings for a lady immediately. Not a
      word to a soul. Then come along with Tom. R.D.F.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lodgings for a lady!&rdquo; Ripton meditated aloud: &ldquo;What sort of lodgings?
      Where am I to get lodgings? Who&rsquo;s the lady?&mdash;I say!&rdquo; he addressed the
      mysterious messenger. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re Tom Bakewell, are you, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom grinned his identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember the rick, Tom? Ha! ha! We got out of that neatly. We
      might all have been transported, though. I could have convicted you, Tom,
      safe! It&rsquo;s no use coming across a practised lawyer. Now tell me.&rdquo; Ripton
      having flourished his powers, commenced his examination: &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this
      lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better wait till you see Mr. Richard, sir,&rdquo; Tom resumed his scowl to
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Ripton acquiesced. &ldquo;Is she young, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom said she was not old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Handsome, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some might think one thing, some another,&rdquo; Tom said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where does she come from now?&rdquo; asked Ripton, with the friendly
      cheerfulness of a baffled counsellor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comes from the country, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend of the family, I suppose? a relation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton left this insinuating query to be answered by a look. Tom&rsquo;s face
      was a dead blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Ripton took a breath, and eyed the mask opposite him. &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re
      quite a scholar, Tom! Mr. Richard is well. All right at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to town this mornin&rsquo; with his uncle,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;All well, thank ye,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried Ripton, more than ever puzzled, &ldquo;now I see. You all came to
      town to-day, and these are your boxes outside. So, so! But Mr. Richard
      writes for me to get lodgings for a lady. There must be some mistake&mdash;he
      wrote in a hurry. He wants lodgings for you all&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;M sure I d&rsquo;n know what he wants,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go by the
      letter, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton re-consulted that document. &ldquo;&lsquo;Lodgings for a lady, and then come
      along with Tom. Not a word to a soul.&rsquo; I say! that looks like&mdash;but he
      never cared for them. You don&rsquo;t mean to say, Tom, he&rsquo;s been running away
      with anybody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom fell back upon his first reply: &ldquo;Better wait till ye see Mr. Richard,
      sir,&rdquo; and Ripton exclaimed: &ldquo;Hanged if you ain&rsquo;t the tightest witness I
      ever saw! I shouldn&rsquo;t like to have you in a box. Some of you country
      fellows beat any number of cockneys. You do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom received the compliment stubbornly on his guard, and Ripton, as
      nothing was to be got out of him, set about considering how to perform his
      friend&rsquo;s injunctions; deciding firstly, that a lady fresh from the country
      ought to lodge near the parks, in which direction he told the cabman to
      drive. Thus, unaware of his high destiny, Ripton joined the hero, and
      accepted his character in the New Comedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, nevertheless, true that certain favoured people do have beneficent
      omens to prepare them for their parts when the hero is in full career, so
      that they really may be nerved to meet him; ay, and to check him in his
      course, had they that signal courage. For instance, Mrs. Elizabeth Berry,
      a ripe and wholesome landlady of advertised lodgings, on the borders of
      Kensington, noted, as she sat rocking her contemplative person before the
      parlour fire this very March afternoon, a supernatural tendency in that
      fire to burn all on one side: which signifies that a wedding approaches
      the house. Why&mdash;who shall say? Omens are as impassable as heroes. It
      may be because in these affairs the fire is thought to be all on one side.
      Enough that the omen exists, and spoke its solemn warning to the devout
      woman. Mrs. Berry, in her circle, was known as a certificated lecturer
      against the snares of matrimony. Still that was no reason why she should
      not like a wedding. Expectant, therefore, she watched the one glowing
      cheek of Hymen, and with pleasing tremours beheld a cab of many boxes draw
      up by her bit of garden, and a gentleman emerge from it in the set of
      consulting an advertisement paper. The gentleman required lodgings for a
      lady. Lodgings for a lady Mrs. Berry could produce, and a very roseate
      smile for a gentleman; so much so that Ripton forgot to ask about the
      terms, which made the landlady in Mrs. Berry leap up to embrace him as the
      happy man. But her experienced woman&rsquo;s eye checked her enthusiasm. He had
      not the air of a bridegroom: he did not seem to have a weight on his
      chest, or an itch to twiddle everything with his fingers. At any rate, he
      was not the bridegroom for whom omens fly abroad. Promising to have all
      ready for the lady within an hour, Mrs. Berry fortified him with her card,
      curtsied him back to his cab, and floated him off on her smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remarkable vehicle which had woven this thread of intrigue through
      London streets, now proceeded sedately to finish its operations. Ripton
      was landed at a hotel in Westminster. Ere he was halfway up the stairs, a
      door opened, and his old comrade in adventure rushed down. Richard allowed
      no time for salutations. &ldquo;Have you done it?&rdquo; was all he asked. For answer
      Ripton handed him Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s card. Richard took it, and left him
      standing there. Five minutes elapsed, and then Ripton heard the gracious
      rustle of feminine garments above. Richard came a little in advance,
      leading and half-supporting a figure in a black-silk mantle and small
      black straw bonnet; young&mdash;that was certain, though she held her veil
      so close he could hardly catch the outlines of her face; girlishly
      slender, and sweet and simple in appearance. The hush that came with her,
      and her soft manner of moving, stirred the silly youth to some of those
      ardours that awaken the Knight of Dames in our bosoms. He felt that he
      would have given considerable sums for her to lift her veil. He could see
      that she was trembling&mdash;perhaps weeping. It was the master of her
      fate she clung to. They passed him without speaking. As she went by, her
      head passively bent, Ripton had a glimpse of noble tresses and a lovely
      neck; great golden curls hung loosely behind, pouring from under her
      bonnet. She looked a captive borne to the sacrifice. What Ripton, after a
      sight of those curls, would have given for her just to lift her veil an
      instant and strike him blind with beauty, was, fortunately for his
      exchequer, never demanded of him. And he had absolutely been composing
      speeches as he came along in the cab! gallant speeches for the lady, and
      sly congratulatory ones for his friend, to be delivered as occasion should
      serve, that both might know him a man of the world, and be at their ease.
      He forgot the smirking immoralities he had revelled in. This was clearly
      serious. Ripton did not require to be told that his friend was in love,
      and meant that life and death business called marriage, parents and
      guardians consenting or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Richard returned to him, and said hurriedly, &ldquo;I want you now to
      go to my uncle at our hotel. Keep him quiet till I come. Say I had to see
      you&mdash;say anything. I shall be there by the dinner hour. Rip! I must
      talk to you alone after dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton feebly attempted to reply that he was due at home. He was very
      curious to hear the plot of the New Comedy; and besides, there was
      Richard&rsquo;s face questioning him sternly and confidently for signs of
      unhesitating obedience. He finished his grimaces by asking the name and
      direction of the hotel. Richard pressed his hand. It is much to obtain
      even that recognition of our devotion from the hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Bakewell also received his priming, and, to judge by his chuckles and
      grins, rather appeared to enjoy the work cut out for him. In a few minutes
      they had driven to their separate destinations; Ripton was left to the
      unusual exercise of his fancy. Such is the nature of youth and its thirst
      for romance, that only to act as a subordinate is pleasant. When one
      unfurls the standard of defiance to parents and guardians, he may be sure
      of raising a lawless troop of adolescent ruffians, born rebels, to any
      amount. The beardless crew know that they have not a chance of pay; but
      what of that when the rosy prospect of thwarting their elders is in view?
      Though it is to see another eat the Forbidden Fruit, they will run all his
      risks with him. Gaily Ripton took rank as lieutenant in the enterprise,
      and the moment his heart had sworn the oaths, he was rewarded by an
      exquisite sense of the charms of existence. London streets wore a sly
      laugh to him. He walked with a dandified heel. The generous youth ogled
      aristocratic carriages, and glanced intimately at the ladies,
      overflowingly happy. The crossing-sweepers blessed him. He hummed lively
      tunes, he turned over old jokes in his mouth unctuously, he hugged
      himself, he had a mind to dance down Piccadilly, and all because a friend
      of his was running away with a pretty girl, and he was in the secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only when he stood on the doorstep of Richard&rsquo;s hotel, that his
      jocund mood was a little dashed by remembering that he had then to
      commence the duties of his office, and must fabricate a plausible story to
      account for what he knew nothing about&mdash;a part that the greatest of
      sages would find it difficult to perform. The young, however, whom sages
      well may envy, seldom fail in lifting their inventive faculties to the
      level of their spirits, and two minutes of Hippias&rsquo;s angry complaints
      against the friend he serenely inquired for, gave Ripton his cue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the very street&mdash;within a stone&rsquo;s-throw of the house, and
      he jumps like a harlequin out of my cab into another; he must be mad&mdash;that
      boy&rsquo;s got madness in him!&mdash;and carries off all the boxes&mdash;my
      dinner-pills, too! and keeps away the whole of the day, though he promised
      to go to the doctor, and had a dozen engagements with me,&rdquo; said Hippias,
      venting an enraged snarl to sum up his grievances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton at once told him that the doctor was not at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t mean to say he&rsquo;s been to the doctor?&rdquo; Hippias cried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has called on him twice, sir,&rdquo; said Ripton, expressively. &ldquo;On leaving
      me he was going a third time. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder that&rsquo;s what detains him&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      so determined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By fine degrees Ripton ventured to grow circumstantial, saying that
      Richard&rsquo;s case was urgent and required immediate medical advice; and that
      both he and his father were of opinion Richard should not lose an hour in
      obtaining it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s alarmed about himself,&rdquo; said Ripton, and tapped his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippias protested he had never heard a word from his nephew of any
      physical affliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was afraid of making you anxious, I think, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Algernon Feverel and Richard came in while he was hammering at the
      alphabet to recollect the first letter of the doctor&rsquo;s name. They had met
      in the hall below, and were laughing heartily as they entered the room.
      Ripton jumped up to get the initiative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen the doctor?&rdquo; he asked, significantly plucking at Richard&rsquo;s
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard was all abroad at the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Algernon clapped him on the back. &ldquo;What the deuce do you want with doctor,
      boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The solid thump awakened him to see matters as they were. &ldquo;Oh, ay! the
      doctor!&rdquo; he said, smiling frankly at his lieutenant. &ldquo;Why, he tells me
      he&rsquo;d back me to do Milo&rsquo;s trick in a week from the present day.&mdash;Uncle,&rdquo;
       he came forward to Hippias, &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll excuse me for running off as I
      did. I was in a hurry. I left something at the railway. This stupid Rip
      thinks I went to the doctor about myself. The fact was, I wanted to fetch
      the doctor to see you here&mdash;so that you might have no trouble, you
      know. You can&rsquo;t bear the sight of his instruments and skeletons&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      heard you say so. You said it set all your marrow in revolt&mdash;&lsquo;fried
      your marrow,&rsquo; I think were the words, and made you see twenty thousand
      different ways of sliding down to the chambers of the Grim King. Don&rsquo;t you
      remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hippias emphatically did not remember, and he did not believe the story.
      Irritation at the mad ravishment of his pill-box rendered him incredulous.
      As he had no means of confuting his nephew, all he could do safely to
      express his disbelief in him, was to utter petulant remarks on his
      powerlessness to appear at the dinner-table that day: upon which&mdash;Berry
      just then trumpeting dinner&mdash;Algernon seized one arm of the Dyspepsy,
      and Richard another, and the laughing couple bore him into the room where
      dinner was laid, Ripton sniggering in the rear, the really happy man of
      the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had fun at the dinner-table. Richard would have it; and his gaiety,
      his by-play, his princely superiority to truth and heroic promise of
      overriding all our laws, his handsome face, the lord and possessor of
      beauty that he looked, as it were a star shining on his forehead, gained
      the old complete mastery over Ripton, who had been, mentally at least,
      half patronizing him till then, because he knew more of London and life,
      and was aware that his friend now depended upon him almost entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a second circle of the claret, the hero caught his lieutenant&rsquo;s eye
      across the table, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must go out and talk over that law-business, Rip, before you go. Do
      you think the old lady has any chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit!&rdquo; said Ripton, authoritatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s worth fighting&mdash;eh, Rip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly!&rdquo; was Ripton&rsquo;s mature opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard observed that Ripton&rsquo;s father seemed doubtful. Ripton cited his
      father&rsquo;s habitual caution. Richard made a playful remark on the necessity
      of sometimes acting in opposition to fathers. Ripton agreed to it&mdash;in
      certain cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! in certain cases,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty legal morality, gentlemen!&rdquo; Algernon interjected; Hippias adding:
      &ldquo;And lay, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pair of uncles listened further to the fictitious dialogue, well kept
      up on both sides, and in the end desired a statement of the old lady&rsquo;s
      garrulous case; Hippias offering to decide what her chances were in law,
      and Algernon to give a common-sense judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rip will tell you,&rdquo; said Richard, deferentially signalling the lawyer.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bad hand at these matters. Tell them how it stands, Rip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton disguised his excessive uneasiness under endeavours to right his
      position on his chair, and, inwardly praying speed to the claret jug to
      come and strengthen his wits, began with a careless aspect: &ldquo;Oh, nothing!
      She very curious old character! She&mdash;a&mdash;wears a wig. She&mdash;a&mdash;very
      curious old character indeed! She&mdash;a&mdash;quite the old style.
      There&rsquo;s no doing anything with her!&rdquo; and Ripton took a long breath to
      relieve himself after his elaborate fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it appears,&rdquo; Hippias commented, and Algernon asked: &ldquo;Well? and about
      her wig? Somebody stole it?&rdquo; while Richard, whose features were grim with
      suppressed laughter, bade the narrator continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton lunged for the claret jug. He had got an old lady like an
      oppressive bundle on his brain, and he was as helpless as she was. In the
      pangs of ineffectual authorship his ideas shot at her wig, and then at her
      one characteristic of extreme obstinacy, and tore back again at her wig,
      but she would not be animated. The obstinate old thing would remain a
      bundle. Law studies seemed light in comparison with this tremendous task
      of changing an old lady from a doll to a human creature. He flung off some
      claret, perspired freely, and, with a mental tribute to the cleverness of
      those author fellows, recommenced: &ldquo;Oh, nothing! She&mdash;Richard knows
      her better than I do&mdash;an old lady&mdash;somewhere down in Suffolk. I
      think we had better advise her not to proceed. The expenses of litigation
      are enormous! She&mdash;I think we had better advise her to stop short,
      and not make any scandal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not make any scandal!&rdquo; Algernon took him up. &ldquo;Come, come! there&rsquo;s
      something more than a wig, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton was commanded to proceed, whether she did or no. The luckless
      fictionist looked straight at his pitiless leader, and blurted out
      dubiously, &ldquo;She&mdash;there&rsquo;s a daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Born with effort!&rdquo; ejaculated Hippias. &ldquo;Must give her pause after that!
      and I&rsquo;ll take the opportunity to stretch my length on the sofa. Heigho!
      that&rsquo;s true what Austin says: &lsquo;The general prayer should be for a full
      stomach, and the individual for one that works well; for on that basis
      only are we a match for temporal matters, and able to contemplate
      eternal.&rsquo; Sententious, but true. I gave him the idea, though! Take care of
      your stomachs, boys! and if ever you hear of a monument proposed to a
      scientific cook or gastronomic doctor, send in your subscriptions. Or say
      to him while he lives, Go forth, and be a Knight! Ha! They have a good
      cook at this house. He suits me better than ours at Raynham. I almost wish
      I had brought my manuscript to town, I feel so much better. Aha! I didn&rsquo;t
      expect to digest at all without my regular incentive. I think I shall give
      it up.&mdash;What do you say to the theatre to-night, boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard shouted, &ldquo;Bravo, uncle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Mr. Thompson finish first,&rdquo; said Algernon. &ldquo;I want to hear the
      conclusion of the story. The old girl has a wig and a daughter. I&rsquo;ll swear
      somebody runs away with one of the two! Fill your glass, Mr. Thompson, and
      forward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So somebody does,&rdquo; Ripton received his impetus. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;re found in
      town together,&rdquo; he made a fresh jerk. &ldquo;She&mdash;a&mdash;that is, the old
      lady&mdash;found them in company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She finds him with her wig on in company!&rdquo; said Algernon. &ldquo;Capital!
      Here&rsquo;s matter for the lawyers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you advise her not to proceed, under such circumstances of
      aggravation?&rdquo; Hippias observed, humorously twinkling with his stomachic
      contentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the daughter,&rdquo; Ripton sighed, and surrendering to pressure, hurried
      on recklessly, &ldquo;A runaway match&mdash;beautiful girl!&mdash;the only son
      of a baronet&mdash;married by special licence. A&mdash;the point is,&rdquo; he
      now brightened and spoke from his own element, &ldquo;the point is whether the
      marriage can be annulled, as she&rsquo;s of the Catholic persuasion and he&rsquo;s a
      Protestant, and they&rsquo;re both married under age. That&rsquo;s the point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having come to the point he breathed extreme relief, and saw things more
      distinctly; not a little amazed at his leader&rsquo;s horrified face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two elders were making various absurd inquiries, when Richard sent his
      chair to the floor, crying, &ldquo;What a muddle you&rsquo;re in, Rip! You&rsquo;re mixing
      half-a-dozen stories together. The old lady I told you about was old Dame
      Bakewell, and the dispute was concerning a neighbour of hers who
      encroached on her garden, and I said I&rsquo;d pay the money to see her
      righted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Ripton, humbly, &ldquo;I was thinking of the other. Her garden!
      Cabbages don&rsquo;t interest me&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, come along,&rdquo; Richard beckoned to him savagely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in
      five minutes, uncle,&rdquo; he nodded coolly to either.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young men left the room. In the hall-passage they met Berry, dressed
      to return to Raynham. Richard dropped a helper to the intelligence into
      his hand, and warned him not to gossip much of London. Berry bowed perfect
      discreetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth induced you to talk about Protestants and Catholics
      marrying, Rip?&rdquo; said Richard, as soon as they were in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Ripton answered, &ldquo;I was so hard pushed for it, &lsquo;pon my honour, I
      didn&rsquo;t know what to say. I ain&rsquo;t an author, you know; I can&rsquo;t make a
      story. I was trying to invent a point, and I couldn&rsquo;t think of any other,
      and I thought that was just the point likely to make a jolly good dispute.
      Capital dinners they give at those crack hotels. Why did you throw it all
      upon me? I didn&rsquo;t begin on the old lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hero mused, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s odd! It&rsquo;s impossible you could have known! I&rsquo;ll tell
      you why, Rip! I wanted to try you. You fib well at long range, but you
      don&rsquo;t do at close quarters and single combat. You&rsquo;re good behind walls,
      but not worth a shot in the open. I just see what you&rsquo;re fit for. You&rsquo;re
      staunch&mdash;that I am certain of. You always were. Lead the way to one
      of the parks&mdash;down in that direction. You know?&mdash;where she is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton led the way. His dinner had prepared this young Englishman to defy
      the whole artillery of established morals. With the muffled roar of London
      around them, alone in a dark slope of green, the hero, leaning on his
      henchman, and speaking in a harsh clear undertone, delivered his
      explanations. Doubtless the true heroic insignia and point of view will be
      discerned, albeit in common private&rsquo;s uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been plotting against me for a year, Rip! When you see her,
      you&rsquo;ll know what it was to have such a creature taken away from you. It
      nearly killed me. Never mind what she is. She&rsquo;s the most perfect and noble
      creature God ever made! It&rsquo;s not only her beauty&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care so
      much about that!&mdash;but when you&rsquo;ve once seen her, she seems to draw
      music from all the nerves of your body; but she&rsquo;s such an angel. I worship
      her. And her mind&rsquo;s like her face. She&rsquo;s pure gold. There, you&rsquo;ll see her
      to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he pursued, after inflating Ripton with this rapturous prospect,
      &ldquo;they got her away, and I recovered. It was Mister Adrian&rsquo;s work. What&rsquo;s
      my father&rsquo;s objection to her? Because of her birth? She&rsquo;s educated; her
      manners are beautiful&mdash;full of refinement&mdash;quick and soft! Can
      they show me one of their ladies like her?&mdash;she&rsquo;s the daughter of a
      naval lieutenant! Because she&rsquo;s a Catholic? What has religion to do with&rdquo;&mdash;he
      pronounced &ldquo;Love!&rdquo; a little modestly&mdash;as it were a blush in his
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when I recovered I thought I did not care for her. It shows how we
      know ourselves! And I cared for nothing. I felt as if I had no blood. I
      tried to imitate my dear Austin. I wish to God he were here. I love
      Austin. He would understand her. He&rsquo;s coming back this year, and then&mdash;but
      it&rsquo;ll be too late then.&mdash;Well, my father&rsquo;s always scheming to make me
      perfect&mdash;he has never spoken to me a word about her, but I can see
      her in his eyes&mdash;he wanted to give me a change, he said, and asked me
      to come to town with my uncle Hippy, and I consented. It was another plot
      to get me out of the way! As I live, I had no more idea of meeting her
      than of flying to heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his face. &ldquo;Look at those old elm branches! How they seem to mix
      among the stars!&mdash;glittering fruits of Winter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton tipped his comical nose upward, and was in duty bound to say, Yes!
      though he observed no connection between them and the narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the hero went on, &ldquo;I came to town. There I heard she was coming,
      too&mdash;coming home. It must have been fate, Ripton! Heaven forgive me!
      I was angry with her, and I thought I should like to see her once&mdash;only
      once&mdash;and reproach her for being false&mdash;for she never wrote to
      me. And, oh, the dear angel! what she must have suffered!&mdash;I gave my
      uncle the slip, and got to the railway she was coming by. There was a
      fellow going to meet her&mdash;a farmer&rsquo;s son&mdash;and, good God! they
      were going to try and make her marry him! I remembered it all then. A
      servant of the farm had told me. That fellow went to the wrong station, I
      suppose, for we saw nothing of him. There she was&mdash;not changed a bit!&mdash;looking
      lovelier than ever! And when she saw me, I knew in a minute that she must
      love me till death!&mdash;You don&rsquo;t know what it is yet, Rip!&mdash;Will
      you believe, it?&mdash;Though I was as sure she loved me and had been true
      as steel, as that I shall see her to-night, I spoke bitterly to her. And
      she bore it meekly&mdash;she looked like a saint. I told her there was but
      one hope of life for me&mdash;she must prove she was true, and as I give
      up all, so must she. I don&rsquo;t know what I said. The thought of losing her
      made me mad. She tried to plead with me to wait&mdash;it was for my sake,
      I know. I pretended, like a miserable hypocrite, that she did not love me
      at all. I think I said shameful things. Oh what noble creatures women are!
      She hardly had strength to move. I took her to that place where you found
      us, Rip! she went down on her knees to me, I never dreamed of anything in
      life so lovely as she looked then. Her eyes were thrown up, bright with a
      crowd of tears&mdash;her dark brows bent together, like Pain and Beauty
      meeting in one; and her glorious golden hair swept off her shoulders as
      she hung forward to my hands.&mdash;Could I lose such a prize.&mdash;If
      anything could have persuaded me, would not that?&mdash;I thought of
      Dante&rsquo;s Madonna&mdash;Guido&rsquo;s Magdalen.&mdash;Is there sin in it? I see
      none! And if there is, it&rsquo;s all mine! I swear she&rsquo;s spotless of a thought
      of sin. I see her very soul? Cease to love her? Who dares ask me? Cease to
      love her? Why, I live on her!&mdash;To see her little chin straining up
      from her throat, as she knelt to me!&mdash;there was one curl that fell
      across her throat&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton listened for more. Richard had gone off in a muse at the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Ripton, &ldquo;and how about that young farmer fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hero&rsquo;s head was again contemplating the starry branches. His
      lieutenant&rsquo;s question came to him after an interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young Tom? Why, it&rsquo;s young Torn Blaize&mdash;son of our old enemy, Rip! I
      like the old man now. Oh! I saw nothing of the fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; cried Ripton, &ldquo;are we going to get into a mess with Blaizes again?
      I don&rsquo;t like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His commander quietly passed his likes or dislikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when he goes to the train, and finds she&rsquo;s not there?&rdquo; Ripton
      suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve provided for that. The fool went to the South-east instead of the
      South-west. All warmth, all sweetness, comes with the South-west!&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      provided for that, friend Rip. My trusty Tom awaits him there, as if by
      accident. He tells him he has not seen her, and advises him to remain in
      town, and go for her there to-morrow, and the day following. Tom has money
      for the work. Young Tom ought to see London, you know, Rip!&mdash;like
      you. We shall gain some good clear days. And when old Blaize hears of it&mdash;what
      then? I have her! she&rsquo;s mine!&mdash;Besides, he won&rsquo;t hear for a week.
      This Tom beats that Tom in cunning, I&rsquo;ll wager. Ha! ha!&rdquo; the hero burst
      out at a recollection. &ldquo;What do you think, Rip? My father has some sort of
      System with me, it appears, and when I came to town the time before, he
      took me to some people&mdash;the Grandisons&mdash;and what do you think?
      one of the daughters is a little girl&mdash;a nice little thing enough
      very funny&mdash;and he wants me to wait for her! He hasn&rsquo;t said so, but I
      know it. I know what he means. Nobody understands him but me. I know he
      loves me, and is one of the best of men&mdash;but just consider!&mdash;a
      little girl who just comes up to my elbow. Isn&rsquo;t it ridiculous? Did you
      ever hear such nonsense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton emphasized his opinion that it certainly was foolish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! The die&rsquo;s cast!&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been plotting for a year
      up to this day, and this is what comes of it! If my father loves me, he
      will love her. And if he loves me, he&rsquo;ll forgive my acting against his
      wishes, and see it was the only thing to be done. Come! step out! what a
      time we&rsquo;ve been!&rdquo; and away he went, compelling Ripton to the sort of
      strides a drummer-boy has to take beside a column of grenadiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton began to wish himself in love, seeing that it endowed a man with
      wind so that he could breathe great sighs, while going at a tremendous
      pace, and experience no sensation of fatigue. The hero was communing with
      the elements, his familiars, and allowed him to pant as he pleased. Some
      keen-eyed Kensington urchins, noticing the discrepancy between the
      pedestrian powers of the two, aimed their wit at Mr. Thompson junior&rsquo;s
      expense. The pace, and nothing but the pace, induced Ripton to proclaim
      that they had gone too far, when they discovered that they had over shot
      the mark by half a mile. In the street over which stood love&rsquo;s star, the
      hero thundered his presence at a door, and evoked a flying housemaid, who
      knew not Mrs. Berry. The hero attached significance to the fact that his
      instincts should have betrayed him, for he could have sworn to that house.
      The door being shut he stood in dead silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got her card?&rdquo; Ripton inquired, and heard that it was in the
      custody of the cabman. Neither of them could positively bring to mind the
      number of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to have chalked it, like that fellow in the Forty Thieves,&rdquo;
       Ripton hazarded a pleasantry which met with no response.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betrayed by his instincts, the magic slaves of Love! The hero heavily
      descended the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton murmured that they were done for. His commander turned on him, and
      said: &ldquo;Take all the houses on the opposite side, one after another. I&rsquo;ll
      take these.&rdquo; With a wry face Ripton crossed the road, altogether subdued
      by Richard&rsquo;s native superiority to adverse circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then were families aroused. Then did mortals dimly guess that something
      portentous was abroad. Then were labourers all day in the vineyard,
      harshly wakened from their evening&rsquo;s nap. Hope and Fear stalked the
      street, as again and again the loud companion summonses resounded. Finally
      Ripton sang out cheerfully. He had Mrs. Berry before him, profuse of
      mellow curtsies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard ran to her and caught her hands: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s well?&mdash;upstairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, quite well! only a trifle tired with her journey, and
      fluttering-like,&rdquo; Mrs. Berry replied to Ripton alone. The lover had flown
      aloft.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wise woman sagely ushered Ripton into her own private parlour, there
      to wait till he was wanted.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In all cases where two have joined to commit an offence, punish one of
      the two lightly,&rdquo; is the dictum of The Pilgrim&rsquo;s&rsquo;s Scrip.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible for young heads to conceive proper plans of action, and
      occasionally, by sheer force of will, to check the wild horses that are
      ever fretting to gallop off with them. But when they have given the reins
      and the whip to another, what are they to do? They may go down on their
      knees, and beg and pray the furious charioteer to stop, or moderate his
      pace. Alas! each fresh thing they do redoubles his ardour: There is a
      power in their troubled beauty women learn the use of, and what wonder?
      They have seen it kindle Ilium to flames so often! But ere they grow
      matronly in the house of Menelaus, they weep, and implore, and do not, in
      truth, know how terribly two-edged is their gift of loveliness. They
      resign themselves to an incomprehensible frenzy; pleasant to them, because
      they attribute it to excessive love. And so the very sensible things which
      they can and do say, are vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reckon it absurd to ask them to be quite in earnest. Are not those their
      own horses in yonder team? Certainly, if they were quite in earnest, they
      might soon have my gentleman as sober as a carter. A hundred different
      ways of disenchanting him exist, and Adrian will point you out one or two
      that shall be instantly efficacious. For Love, the charioteer, is easily
      tripped, while honest jog-trot Love keeps his legs to the end. Granted
      dear women are not quite in earnest, still the mere words they utter
      should be put to their good account. They do mean them, though their
      hearts are set the wrong way. &lsquo;Tis a despairing, pathetic homage to the
      judgment of the majority, in whose faces they are flying. Punish Helen,
      very young, lightly. After a certain age you may select her for special
      chastisement. An innocent with Theseus, with Paris she is an advanced
      incendiary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair young girl was sitting as her lover had left her; trying to
      recall her stunned senses. Her bonnet was un-removed, her hands clasped on
      her knees; dry tears in her eyes. Like a dutiful slave, she rose to him.
      And first he claimed her mouth. There was a speech, made up of all the
      pretty wisdom her wild situation and true love could gather, awaiting him
      there; but his kiss scattered it to fragments. She dropped to her seat
      weeping, and hiding her shamed cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      By his silence she divined his thoughts, and took his hand and drew it to
      her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent beside her, bidding her look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your eyes so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you fear me, Lucy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A throbbing pressure answered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you love me, darling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She trembled from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you turn from me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wept: &ldquo;O Richard, take me home! take me home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at me, Lucy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her head shrank timidly round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your eyes on me, darling! Now speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she could not look and speak too. The lover knew his mastery when he
      had her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish me to take you home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She faltered: &ldquo;O Richard? it is not too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You regret what you have done for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest! it is ruin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You weep because you have consented to be mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for me! O Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me you weep? Look at me! For me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How will it end! O Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You weep for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest! I would die for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you see me indifferent to everything in the world? Would you have
      me lost? Do you think I will live another day in England without you? I
      have staked all I have on you, Lucy. You have nearly killed me once. A
      second time, and the earth will not be troubled by me. You ask me to wait,
      when they are plotting against us on all sides? Darling Lucy! look on me.
      Fix&mdash;your fond eyes on me. You ask me to wait when here you are given
      to me when you have proved my faith&mdash;when we know we love as none
      have loved. Give me your eyes! Let them tell me I have your heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Where was her wise little speech? How could she match such mighty
      eloquence? She sought to collect a few more of the scattered fragments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest! your father may be brought to consent by and by, and then&mdash;oh!
      if you take me home now&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lover stood up. &ldquo;He who has been arranging that fine scheme to
      disgrace and martyrize you? True, as I live! that&rsquo;s the reason of their
      having you back. Your old servant heard him and your uncle discussing it.
      He!&mdash;Lucy! he&rsquo;s a good man, but he must not step in between you and
      me. I say God has given you to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was down by her side again, his arms enfolding her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had hoped to fight a better battle than in the morning, and she was
      weaker and softer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! why should she doubt that his great love was the first law to her? Why
      should she not believe that she would wreck him by resisting? And if she
      suffered, oh sweet to think it was for his sake! Sweet to shut out wisdom;
      accept total blindness, and be led by him!
    </p>
    <p>
      The hag Wisdom annoyed them little further. She rustled her garments
      ominously, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my own Richard!&rdquo; the fair girl just breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He whispered, &ldquo;Call me that name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She blushed deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me that name,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;You said it once today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Husband!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was won. The rosy gate from which the word had issued was closed with
      a seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton did not enjoy his introduction to the caged bird of beauty that
      night. He received a lesson in the art of pumping from the worthy landlady
      below, up to an hour when she yawned, and he blinked, and their common
      candle wore with dignity the brigand&rsquo;s hat of midnight, and cocked a
      drunken eye at them from under it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Beauty, of course, is for the hero. Nevertheless, it is not always he on
      whom beauty works its most conquering influence. It is the dull
      commonplace man into whose slow brain she drops like a celestial light,
      and burns lastingly. The poet, for instance, is a connoisseur of beauty:
      to the artist she is a model. These gentlemen by much contemplation of her
      charms wax critical. The days when they had hearts being gone, they are
      haply divided between the blonde and the brunette; the aquiline nose and
      the Proserpine; this shaped eye and that. But go about among simple
      unprofessional fellows, boors, dunderheads, and here and there you shall
      find some barbarous intelligence which has had just strength enough to
      conceive, and has taken Beauty as its Goddess, and knows but one form to
      worship, in its poor stupid fashion, and would perish for her. Nay, more:
      the man would devote all his days to her, though he is dumb as a dog. And,
      indeed, he is Beauty&rsquo;s Dog. Almost every Beauty has her Dog. The hero
      possesses her; the poet proclaims her; the painter puts her upon canvas;
      and the faithful Old Dog follows her: and the end of it all is that the
      faithful Old Dog is her single attendant. Sir Hero is revelling in the
      wars, or in Armida&rsquo;s bowers; Mr. Poet has spied a wrinkle; the brush is
      for the rose in its season. She turns to her Old Dog then. She hugs him;
      and he, who has subsisted on a bone and a pat till there he squats
      decrepit, he turns his grateful old eyes up to her, and has not a notion
      that she is hugging sad memories in him: Hero, Poet, Painter, in one
      scrubby one! Then is she buried, and the village hears languid howls, and
      there is a paragraph in the newspapers concerning the extraordinary
      fidelity of an Old Dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excited by suggestive recollections of Nooredeen and the Fair Persian, and
      the change in the obscure monotony of his life by his having quarters in a
      crack hotel, and living familiarly with West-End people&mdash;living on
      the fat of the land (which forms a stout portion of an honest youth&rsquo;s
      romance), Ripton Thompson breakfasted next morning with his chief at
      half-past eight. The meal had been fixed overnight for seven, but Ripton
      slept a great deal more than the nightingale, and (to chronicle his exact
      state) even half-past eight rather afflicted his new aristocratic senses
      and reminded him too keenly of law and bondage. He had preferred to
      breakfast at Algernon&rsquo;s hour, who had left word for eleven. Him, however,
      it was Richard&rsquo;s object to avoid, so they fell to, and Ripton no longer
      envied Hippias in bed. Breakfast done, they bequeathed the consoling
      information for Algernon that they were off to hear a popular preacher,
      and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How happy everybody looks!&rdquo; said Richard, in the quiet Sunday streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;jolly!&rdquo; said Ripton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m&mdash;when this is over, I&rsquo;ll see that they are, too&mdash;as
      many as I can make happy,&rdquo; said the hero; adding softly: &ldquo;Her blind was
      down at a quarter to six. I think she slept well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been there this morning?&rdquo; Ripton exclaimed; and an idea of what
      love was dawned upon his dull brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will she see me, Ricky?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She&rsquo;ll see you to-day. She was tired last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positively?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard assured him that the privilege would be his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, coming under some trees in the park, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s where I
      talked to you last night. What a time it seems! How I hate the night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the way, that Richard might have an exalted opinion of him, Ripton
      hinted decorously at a somewhat intimate and mysterious acquaintance with
      the sex. Headings of certain random adventures he gave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said his chief, &ldquo;why not marry her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then was Ripton shocked, and cried, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and had a taste of the feeling
      of superiority, destined that day to be crushed utterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was again deposited in Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s charge for a term that caused him
      dismal fears that the Fair Persian still refused to show her face, but
      Richard called out to him, and up Ripton went, unaware of the
      transformation he was to undergo. Hero and Beauty stood together to
      receive him. From the bottom of the stairs he had his vivaciously
      agreeable smile ready for them, and by the time he entered the room his
      cheeks were painfully stiff, and his eyes had strained beyond their exact
      meaning. Lucy, with one hand anchored to her lover, welcomed him kindly.
      He relieved her shyness by looking so extremely silly. They sat down, and
      tried to commence a conversation, but Ripton was as little master of his
      tongue as he was of his eyes. After an interval, the Fair Persian having
      done duty by showing herself, was glad to quit the room. Her lord and
      possessor then turned inquiringly to Ripton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t wonder now, Rip?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Richard!&rdquo; Ripton waited to reply with sufficient solemnity, &ldquo;indeed I
      don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke differently; he looked differently. He had the Old Dog&rsquo;s eyes in
      his head. They watched the door she had passed through; they listened for
      her, as dogs&rsquo; eyes do. When she came in, bonneted for a walk, his
      agitation was dog-like. When she hung on her lover timidly, and went
      forth, he followed without an idea of envy, or anything save the secret
      raptures the sight of her gave him, which are the Old Dog&rsquo;s own. For
      beneficent Nature requites him: His sensations cannot be heroic, but they
      have a fulness and a wagging delight as good in their way. And this
      capacity for humble unaspiring worship has its peculiar guerdon. When
      Ripton comes to think of Miss Random now, what will he think of himself?
      Let no one despise the Old Dog. Through him doth Beauty vindicate her sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not please Ripton that others should have the bliss of beholding
      her, and as, to his perceptions, everybody did, and observed her
      offensively, and stared, and turned their heads back, and interchanged
      comments on her, and became in a minute madly in love with her, he had to
      smother low growls. They strolled about the pleasant gardens of Kensington
      all the morning, under the young chestnut buds, and round the windless
      waters, talking, and soothing the wild excitement of their hearts. If Lucy
      spoke, Ripton pricked up his ears. She, too, made the remark that
      everybody seemed to look happy, and he heard it with thrills of joy. &ldquo;So
      everybody is, where you are!&rdquo; he would have wished to say, if he dared,
      but was restrained by fears that his burning eloquence would commit him.
      Ripton knew the people he met twice. It would have been difficult to
      persuade him they were the creatures of accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Gardens, in contempt of Ripton&rsquo;s frowned protest, Richard boldly
      struck into the park, where solitary carriages were beginning to perform
      the circuit. Here Ripton had some justification for his jealous pangs. The
      young girl&rsquo;s golden locks of hair; her sweet, now dreamily sad, face; her
      gentle graceful figure in the black straight dress she wore; a sort of
      half-conventual air she had&mdash;a mark of something not of class, that
      was partly beauty&rsquo;s, partly maiden innocence growing conscious, partly
      remorse at her weakness and dim fear of the future it was sowing&mdash;did
      attract the eye-glasses. Ripton had to learn that eyes are bearable, but
      eye-glasses an abomination. They fixed a spell upon his courage; for
      somehow the youth had always ranked them as emblems of our nobility, and
      hearing two exquisite eye-glasses, who had been to front and rear several
      times, drawl in gibberish generally imputed to lords, that his heroine was
      a charming little creature, just the size, but had no style,&mdash;he was
      abashed; he did not fly at them and tear them. He became dejected.
      Beauty&rsquo;s dog is affected by the eye-glass in a manner not unlike the
      common animal&rsquo;s terror of the human eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard appeared to hear nothing, or it was homage that he heard. He
      repeated to Lucy Diaper Sandoe&rsquo;s verses&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;The cockneys nod to each other aside,
     The coxcombs lift their glasses,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and projected hiring a horse for her to ride every day in the park, and
      shine among the highest.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had turned to the West, against the sky glittering through the bare
      trees across the water, and the bright-edged rack. The lover, his
      imagination just then occupied in clothing earthly glories in celestial,
      felt where his senses were sharpest the hand of his darling falter, and
      instinctively looked ahead. His uncle Algernon was leisurely jolting
      towards them on his one sound leg. The dismembered Guardsman talked to a
      friend whose arm supported him, and speculated from time to time on the
      fair ladies driving by. The two white faces passed him unobserved.
      Unfortunately Ripton, coming behind, went plump upon the Captain&rsquo;s live
      toe&mdash;or so he pretended, crying, &ldquo;Confound it, Mr. Thompson! you
      might have chosen the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horrible apparition did confound Ripton, who stammered that it was
      extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Algernon. &ldquo;Everybody makes up to that fellow. Instinct,
      I suppose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not to ask for his nephew. Richard turned to face the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry I couldn&rsquo;t wait for you this morning, uncle,&rdquo; he said, with the
      coolness of relationship. &ldquo;I thought you never walked so far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice was in perfect tone&mdash;the heroic mask admirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Algernon examined the downcast visage at his side, and contrived to allude
      to the popular preacher. He was instantly introduced to Ripton&rsquo;s sister,
      Miss Thompson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain bowed, smiling melancholy approval of his nephew&rsquo;s choice of a
      minister. After a few stray remarks, and an affable salute to Miss
      Thompson, he hobbled away, and then the three sealed volcanoes breathed,
      and Lucy&rsquo;s arm ceased to be squeezed quite so much up to the heroic pitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      This incident quickened their steps homeward to the sheltering wings of
      Mrs. Berry. All that passed between them on the subject comprised a
      stammered excuse from Ripton for his conduct, and a good-humoured
      rejoinder from Richard, that he had gained a sister by it: at which Ripton
      ventured to wish aloud Miss Desborough would only think so, and a faint
      smile twitched poor Lucy&rsquo;s lips to please him. She hardly had strength to
      reach her cage. She had none to eat of Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s nice little dinner. To
      be alone, that she might cry and ease her heart of its accusing weight of
      tears, was all she prayed for. Kind Mrs. Berry, slipping into her bedroom
      to take off her things, found the fair body in a fevered shudder, and
      finished by undressing her completely and putting her to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just an hour&rsquo;s sleep, or so,&rdquo; the mellifluous woman explained the case to
      the two anxious gentlemen. &ldquo;A quiet sleep and a cup of warm tea goes for
      more than twenty doctors, it do&mdash;when there&rsquo;s the flutters,&rdquo; she
      pursued. &ldquo;I know it by myself. And a good cry beforehand&rsquo;s better than the
      best of medicine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nursed them into a make-believe of eating, and retired to her softer
      charge and sweeter babe, reflecting, &ldquo;Lord! Lord! the three of &lsquo;em don&rsquo;t
      make fifty! I&rsquo;m as old as two and a half of &lsquo;em, to say the least.&rdquo; Mrs.
      Berry used her apron, and by virtue of their tender years took them all
      three into her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, neither of the young men could swallow a morsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see the change come over her?&rdquo; Richard whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton fiercely accused his prodigious stupidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lover flung down his knife and fork: &ldquo;What could I do? If I had said
      nothing, we should have been suspected. I was obliged to speak. And she
      hates a lie! See! it has struck her down. God forgive me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton affected a serene mind: &ldquo;It was a fright, Richard,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Mrs. Berry means by flutters. Those old women talk in that
      way. You heard what she said. And these old women know. I&rsquo;ll tell you what
      it is. It&rsquo;s this, Richard!&mdash;it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve got a fool for your
      friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She regrets it,&rdquo; muttered the lover. &ldquo;Good God! I think she fears me.&rdquo; He
      dropped his face in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton went to the window, repeating energetically for his comfort: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      because you&rsquo;ve got a fool for your friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sombre grew the street they had last night aroused. The sun was buried
      alive in cloud. Ripton saw himself no more in the opposite window. He
      watched the deplorable objects passing on the pavement. His aristocratic
      visions had gone like his breakfast. Beauty had been struck down by his
      egregious folly, and there he stood&mdash;a wretch!
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard came to him: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mumble on like that, Rip!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nobody
      blames you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you&rsquo;re very kind, Richard,&rdquo; interposed the wretch, moved at the face
      of misery he beheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Rip! I shall take her home to-night. Yes! If she&rsquo;s happier
      away from me!&mdash;do you think me a brute, Ripton? Rather than have her
      shed a tear, I&rsquo;d!&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take her home to-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton suggested that it was sudden; adding from his larger experience,
      people perhaps might talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lover could not understand what they should talk about, but he said:
      &ldquo;If I give him who came for her yesterday the clue? If no one sees or
      hears of me, what can they say? O Rip! I&rsquo;ll give her up. I&rsquo;m wrecked for
      ever! What of that? Yes&mdash;let them take her! The world in arms should
      never have torn her from me, but when she cries&mdash;Yes! all&rsquo;s over.
      I&rsquo;ll find him at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He searched in out-of-the-way corners for the hat of resolve. Ripton
      looked on, wretcheder than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea struck him:&mdash;&ldquo;Suppose, Richard, she doesn&rsquo;t want to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a moment when, perhaps, one who sided with parents and guardians
      and the old wise world, might have inclined them to pursue their righteous
      wretched course, and have given small Cupid a smack and sent him home to
      his naughty Mother. Alas!(it is The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip interjecting) women
      are the born accomplices of mischief! In bustles Mrs. Berry to clear away
      the refection, and finds the two knights helmed, and sees, though &lsquo;tis
      dusk, that they wear doubtful brows, and guesses bad things for her dear
      God Hymen in a twinkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear! dear!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;and neither of you eaten a scrap! And
      there&rsquo;s my dear young lady off into the prettiest sleep you ever see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha?&rdquo; cried the lover, illuminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soft as a baby!&rdquo; Mrs. Berry averred. &ldquo;I went to look at her this very
      moment, and there&rsquo;s not a bit of trouble in her breath. It come and it go
      like the sweetest regular instrument ever made. The Black Ox haven&rsquo;t trod
      on her foot yet! Most like it was the air of London. But only fancy, if
      you had called in a doctor! Why, I shouldn&rsquo;t have let her take any of his
      quackery. Now, there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton attentively observed his chief, and saw him doff his hat with a
      curious caution, and peer into its recess, from which, during Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s
      speech, he drew forth a little glove&mdash;dropped there by some freak of
      chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep me, keep me, now you have me!&rdquo; sang the little glove, and amused the
      lover with a thousand conceits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will she wake, do you think, Mrs. Berry?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! we mustn&rsquo;t go for disturbing her,&rdquo; said the guileful good creature.
      &ldquo;Bless ye! let her sleep it out. And if you young gentlemen was to take my
      advice, and go and take a walk for to get a appetite&mdash;everybody
      should eat! it&rsquo;s their sacred duty, no matter what their feelings be! and
      I say it who&rsquo;m no chicken!&mdash;I&rsquo;ll frickashee this&mdash;which is a
      chicken&mdash;against your return. I&rsquo;m a cook, I can assure ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lover seized her two hands. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the best old soul in the world!&rdquo;
       he cried. Mrs. Berry appeared willing to kiss him. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t disturb her.
      Let her sleep. Keep her in bed, Mrs. Berry. Will you? And we&rsquo;ll call to
      inquire after her this evening, and come and see her to-morrow. I&rsquo;m sure
      you&rsquo;ll be kind to her. There! there!&rdquo; Mrs. Berry was preparing to whimper.
      &ldquo;I trust her to you, you see. Good-bye, you dear old soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smuggled a handful of gold into her keeping, and went to dine with his
      uncles, happy and hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they reached the hotel, they had agreed to draw Mrs. Berry into
      their confidence, telling her (with embellishments) all save their names,
      so that they might enjoy the counsel and assistance of that trump of a
      woman, and yet have nothing to fear from her. Lucy was to receive the name
      of Letitia, Ripton&rsquo;s youngest and best-looking sister. The heartless
      fellow proposed it in cruel mockery of an old weakness of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letitia!&rdquo; mused Richard. &ldquo;I like the name. Both begin with L. There&rsquo;s
      something soft&mdash;womanlike&mdash;in the L.&lsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Material Ripton remarked that they looked like pounds on paper. The lover
      roamed through his golden groves. &ldquo;Lucy Feverel! that sounds better! I
      wonder where Ralph is. I should like to help him. He&rsquo;s in love with my
      cousin Clare. He&rsquo;ll never do anything till he marries. No man can. I&rsquo;m
      going to do a hundred things when it&rsquo;s over. We shall travel first. I want
      to see the Alps. One doesn&rsquo;t know what the earth is till one has seen the
      Alps. What a delight it will be to her! I fancy I see her eyes gazing up
      at them.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;And oh, your dear blue eyes, that heavenward glance
    With kindred beauty, banished humbleness,
    Past weeping for mortality&rsquo;s distress&mdash;
   Yet from your soul a tear hangs there in trance.
     And fills, but does not fall;
     Softly I hear it call
   At heaven&rsquo;s gate, till Sister Seraphs press
   To look on you their old love from the skies:
   Those are the eyes of Seraphs bright on your blue eyes!
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful! These lines, Rip, were written by a man who was once a friend
      of my father&rsquo;s. I intend to find him and make them friends again. You
      don&rsquo;t care for poetry. It&rsquo;s no use your trying to swallow it, Rip!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds very nice,&rdquo; said Ripton, modestly shutting his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Alps! Italy! Rome! and then I shall go to the East,&rdquo; the hero
      continued. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s ready to go anywhere with me, the dear brave heart! Oh,
      the glorious golden East! I dream of the desert. I dream I&rsquo;m chief of an
      Arab tribe, and we fly all white in the moonlight on our mares, and hurry
      to the rescue of my darling! And we push the spears, and we scatter them,
      and I come to the tent where she crouches, and catch her to my saddle, and
      away!&mdash;Rip! what a life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton strove to imagine he could enjoy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then we shall come home, and I shall lead Austin&rsquo;s life, with her to
      help me. First be virtuous, Rip! and then serve your country heart and
      soul. A wise man told me that. I think I shall do something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sunshine and cloud, cloud and sunshine, passed over the lover. Now life
      was a narrow ring; now the distances extended, were winged, flew
      illimitably. An hour ago and food was hateful. Now he manfully refreshed
      his nature, and joined in Algernon&rsquo;s encomiums on Miss Letitia Thompson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Beauty slept, watched by the veteran volunteer of the hero&rsquo;s
      band. Lucy awoke from dreams which seemed reality, to the reality which
      was a dream. She awoke calling for some friend, &ldquo;Margaret!&rdquo; and heard one
      say, &ldquo;My name is Bessy Berry, my love! not Margaret.&rdquo; Then she asked
      piteously where she was, and where was Margaret, her dear friend, and Mrs.
      Berry whispered, &ldquo;Sure you&rsquo;ve got a dearer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed Lucy, sinking on her pillow, overwhelmed by the strangeness
      of her state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry closed the frill of her nightgown and adjusted the bedclothes
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her name was breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my love?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone?&mdash;Oh, where?&rdquo; The young girl started up in disorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone, to be back, my love! Ah! that young gentleman!&rdquo; Mrs. Berry chanted:
      &ldquo;Not a morsel have he eat; not a drop have he drunk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Mrs. Berry! why did you not make him?&rdquo; Lucy wept for the famine-struck
      hero, who was just then feeding mightily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry explained that to make one eat who thought the darling of his
      heart like to die, was a sheer impossibility for the cleverest of women;
      and on this deep truth Lucy reflected, with her eyes wide at the candle.
      She wanted one to pour her feelings out to. She slid her hand from under
      the bedclothes, and took Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s, and kissed it. The good creature
      required no further avowal of her secret, but forthwith leaned her
      consummate bosom to the pillow, and petitioned heaven to bless them both!&mdash;Then
      the little bride was alarmed, and wondered how Mrs. Berry could have
      guessed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry, &ldquo;your love is out of your eyes, and out of
      everything ye do.&rdquo; And the little bride wondered more. She thought she had
      been so very cautious not to betray it. The common woman in them made
      cheer together after their own April fashion. Following which Mrs. Berry
      probed for the sweet particulars of this beautiful love-match; but the
      little bride&rsquo;s lips were locked. She only said her lover was above her in
      station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re a Catholic, my dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Berry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And him a Protestant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Berry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear!&mdash;And why shouldn&rsquo;t ye be?&rdquo; she ejaculated, seeing
      sadness return to the bridal babe. &ldquo;So as you was born, so shall ye be!
      But you&rsquo;ll have to make your arrangements about the children. The girls to
      worship with yet, the boys with him. It&rsquo;s the same God, my dear! You
      mustn&rsquo;t blush at it, though you do look so pretty. If my young gentleman
      could see you now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Mrs. Berry!&rdquo; Lucy murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he will, you know, my dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please, Mrs. Berry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you that can&rsquo;t bear the thoughts of it! Well, I do wish there was
      fathers and mothers on both sides and dock-ments signed, and bridesmaids,
      and a breakfast! but love is love, and ever will be, in spite of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made other and deeper dives into the little heart, but though she drew
      up pearls, they were not of the kind she searched for. The one fact that
      hung as a fruit upon her tree of Love, Lucy had given her; she would not,
      in fealty to her lover, reveal its growth and history, however sadly she
      yearned to pour out all to this dear old Mother Confessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her conduct drove Mrs. Berry from the rosy to the autumnal view of
      matrimony, generally heralded by the announcement that it is a lottery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when you see your ticket,&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry, &ldquo;you shan&rsquo;t know whether
      it&rsquo;s a prize or a blank. And, Lord knows! some go on thinking it&rsquo;s a prize
      when it turns on &lsquo;em and tears &lsquo;em. I&rsquo;m one of the blanks, my dear! I drew
      a blank in Berry. He was a black Berry to me, my dear! Smile away! he
      truly was, and I a-prizin&rsquo; him as proud as you can conceive! My dear!&rdquo;
       Mrs. Berry pressed her hands flat on her apron. &ldquo;We hadn&rsquo;t been a three
      months man and wife, when that man&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t the honeymoon, which
      some can&rsquo;t say&mdash;that man&mdash;Yes! he kicked me. His wedded wife he
      kicked! Ah!&rdquo; she sighed to Lucy&rsquo;s large eyes, &ldquo;I could have borne that. A
      blow don&rsquo;t touch the heart,&rdquo; the poor creature tapped her sensitive side.
      &ldquo;I went on loving of him, for I&rsquo;m a soft one. Tall as a Grenadier he is,
      and when out of service grows his moustache. I used to call him my
      body-guardsman like a Queen! I flattered him like the fools we women are.
      For, take my word for it, my dear, there&rsquo;s nothing here below so vain as a
      man! That I know. But I didn&rsquo;t deserve it.... I&rsquo;m a superior cook.... I
      did not deserve that noways.&rdquo; Mrs. Berry thumped her knee, and accentuated
      up her climax: &ldquo;I mended his linen. I saw to his adornments&mdash;he
      called his clothes, the bad man! I was a servant to him, my dear! and
      there&mdash;it was nine months&mdash;nine months from the day he swear to
      protect and cherish and that&mdash;nine calendar months, and my gentleman
      is off with another woman! Bone of his bone!&mdash;pish!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs.
      Berry, reckoning her wrongs over vividly. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my ring. A pretty
      ornament! What do it mean? I&rsquo;m for tearin&rsquo; it off my finger a dozen times
      in the day. It&rsquo;s a symbol? I call it a tomfoolery for the dead-alive to
      wear it, that&rsquo;s a widow and not a widow, and haven&rsquo;t got a name for what
      she is in any Dixonary, I&rsquo;ve looked, my dear, and&rdquo;&mdash;she spread out
      her arms&mdash;&ldquo;Johnson haven&rsquo;t got a name for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this impressive woe Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s voice quavered into sobs. Lucy spoke
      gentle words to the poor outcast from Johnson. The sorrows of Autumn have
      no warning for April. The little bride, for all her tender pity, felt
      happier when she had heard her landlady&rsquo;s moving tale of the wickedness of
      man, which cast in bright relief the glory of that one hero who was hers.
      Then from a short flight of inconceivable bliss, she fell, shot by one of
      her hundred Argus-eyed fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Mrs. Berry! I&rsquo;m so young! Think of me&mdash;only just seventeen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry immediately dried her eyes to radiance. &ldquo;Young, my dear!
      Nonsense! There&rsquo;s no so much harm in being young, here and there. I knew
      an Irish lady was married at fourteen. Her daughter married close over
      fourteen. She was a grandmother by thirty! When any strange man began, she
      used to ask him what pattern caps grandmothers wore. They&rsquo;d stare! Bless
      you! the grandmother could have married over and over again. It was her
      daughter&rsquo;s fault, not hers, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was three years younger,&rdquo; mused Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She married beneath her, my dear. Ran off with her father&rsquo;s bailiff&rsquo;s
      son. &lsquo;Ah, Berry!&rsquo; she&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;if I hadn&rsquo;t been foolish, I should be my
      lady now&mdash;not Granny!&rsquo; Her father never forgave her&mdash;left all
      his estates out of the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did her husband always love her?&rdquo; Lucy preferred to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his way, my dear, he did,&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry, coming upon her
      matrimonial wisdom. &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t help himself. If he left off, he began
      again. She was so clever, and did make him so comfortable. Cook! there
      wasn&rsquo;t such another cook out of a Alderman&rsquo;s kitchen; no, indeed! And she
      a born lady! That tells ye it&rsquo;s the duty of all women! She had her saying
      &lsquo;When the parlour fire gets low, put coals on the ketchen fire!&rsquo; and a
      good saying it is to treasure. Such is man! no use in havin&rsquo; their hearts
      if ye don&rsquo;t have their stomachs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving that she grew abstruse, Mrs. Berry added briskly: &ldquo;You know
      nothing about that yet, my dear. Only mind me and mark me: don&rsquo;t neglect
      your cookery. Kissing don&rsquo;t last: cookery do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here, with an aphorism worthy a place in The Pilgrim&rsquo;S Scrip, she broke
      off to go posseting for her dear invalid. Lucy was quite well; very eager
      to be allowed to rise and be ready when the knock should come. Mrs. Berry,
      in her loving considerateness for the little bride, positively commanded
      her to lie down, and be quiet, and submit to be nursed and cherished. For
      Mrs. Berry well knew that ten minutes alone with the hero could only be
      had while the little bride was in that unattainable position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to her strategy, as she thought, her object was gained. The night
      did not pass before she learnt, from the hero&rsquo;s own mouth, that Mr.
      Richards, the father of the hero, and a stern lawyer, was adverse to his
      union with this young lady he loved, because of a ward of his, heiress to
      an immense property, whom he desired his son to espouse; and because his
      darling Letitia was a Catholic&mdash;Letitia, the sole daughter of a brave
      naval officer deceased, and in the hands of a savage uncle, who wanted to
      sacrifice this beauty to a brute of a son. Mrs. Berry listened credulously
      to the emphatic narrative, and spoke to the effect that the wickedness of
      old people formed the excuse for the wildness of young ones. The
      ceremonious administration of oaths of secrecy and devotion over, she was
      enrolled in the hero&rsquo;s band, which now numbered three, and entered upon
      the duties with feminine energy, for there are no conspirators like women.
      Ripton&rsquo;s lieutenancy became a sinecure, his rank merely titular. He had
      never been married&mdash;he knew nothing about licences, except that they
      must be obtained, and were not difficult&mdash;he had not an idea that so
      many days&rsquo; warning must be given to the clergyman of the parish where one
      of the parties was resident. How should he? All his forethought was
      comprised in the ring, and whenever the discussion of arrangements for the
      great event grew particularly hot and important, he would say, with a
      shrewd nod: &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t forget the ring, you know, Mrs. Berry!&rdquo; and the
      new member was only prevented by natural complacence from shouting: &ldquo;Oh,
      drat ye! and your ring too.&rdquo; Mrs. Berry had acted conspicuously in fifteen
      marriages, by banns, and by licence, and to have such an obvious requisite
      dinned in her ears was exasperating. They could not have contracted
      alliance with an auxiliary more invaluable, an authority so profound; and
      they acknowledged it to themselves. The hero marched like an automaton at
      her bidding; Lieutenant Thompson was rejoiced to perform services as
      errand-boy in the enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in hopes you&rsquo;ll be happier than me, I do it,&rdquo; said the devout and
      charitable Berry. &ldquo;Marriages is made in heaven, they say; and if that&rsquo;s
      the case, I say they don&rsquo;t take much account of us below!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her own woeful experiences had been given to the hero in exchange for his
      story of cruel parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard vowed to her that he would henceforth hold it a duty to hunt out
      the wanderer from wedded bonds, and bring him back bound and suppliant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll come!&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry, pursing prophetic wrinkles: &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll come
      of his own accord. Never anywhere will he meet such a cook as Bessy Berry!
      And he know her value in his heart of hearts. And I do believe, when he do
      come, I shall be opening these arms to him again, and not slapping his
      impidence in the face&mdash;I&rsquo;m that soft! I always was&mdash;in
      matrimony, Mr. Richards!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As when nations are secretly preparing for war, the docks and arsenals
      hammer night and day, and busy contractors measure time by inches, and the
      air hums around: for leagues as it were myriads of bees, so the house and
      neighbourhood of the matrimonial soft one resounded in the heroic style,
      and knew little of the changes of light decreed by Creation. Mrs. Berry
      was the general of the hour. Down to Doctors&rsquo; Commons she expedited the
      hero, instructing him how boldly to face the Law, and fib: for that the
      Law never could mist a fib and a bold face. Down the hero went, and
      proclaimed his presence. And lo! the Law danced to him its sedatest lovely
      bear&rsquo;s-dance. Think ye the Lawless susceptible to him than flesh and
      blood? With a beautiful confidence it put the few familiar questions to
      him, and nodded to his replies: then stamped the bond, and took the fee.
      It must be an old vagabond at heart that can permit the irrevocable to go
      so cheap, even to a hero. For only mark him when he is petitioned by
      heroes and heroines to undo what he does so easily! That small archway of
      Doctors&rsquo; Commons seems the eye of a needle, through which the lean purse
      has a way, somehow, of slipping more readily than the portly; but once
      through, all are camels alike, the lean purse an especially big camel.
      Dispensing tremendous marriage as it does, the Law can have no conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t the slightest difficulty,&rdquo; said the exulting hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; returns Mrs. Berry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as easy, if ye&rsquo;re in earnest,
      as buying a plum bun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Likewise the ambassador of the hero went to claim the promise of the
      Church to be in attendance on a certain spot, on a certain day, and there
      hear oath of eternal fealty, and gird him about with all its forces: which
      the Church, receiving a wink from the Law, obsequiously engaged to do, for
      less than the price of a plum-cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, while craftsmen and skilled women, directed by Mrs. Berry, were
      toiling to deck the day at hand, Raynham and Belthorpe slept,&mdash;the
      former soundly; and one day was as another to them. Regularly every
      morning a letter arrived from Richard to his father, containing
      observations on the phenomena of London; remarks (mainly cynical) on the
      speeches and acts of Parliament; and reasons for not having yet been able
      to call on the Grandisons. They were certainly rather monotonous and
      spiritless. The baronet did not complain. That cold dutiful tone assured
      him there was no internal trouble or distraction. &ldquo;The letters of a
      healthful physique!&rdquo; he said to Lady Blandish, with sure insight.
      Complacently he sat and smiled, little witting that his son&rsquo;s ordeal was
      imminent, and that his son&rsquo;s ordeal was to be his own. Hippias wrote that
      his nephew was killing him by making appointments which he never kept, and
      altogether neglecting him in the most shameless way, so that his
      ganglionic centre was in a ten times worse state than when he left
      Raynham. He wrote very bitterly, but it was hard to feel compassion for
      his offended stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, young Tom Blaize was not forthcoming, and had
      despatched no tidings whatever. Farmer Blaize smoked his pipe evening
      after evening, vastly disturbed. London was a large place&mdash;young Tom
      might be lost in it, he thought; and young Tom had his weaknesses. A wolf
      at Belthorpe, he was likely to be a sheep in London, as yokels have
      proved. But what had become of Lucy? This consideration almost sent Farmer
      Blaize off to London direct, and he would have gone had not his pipe
      enlightened him. A young fellow might play truant and get into a scrape,
      but a young man and a young woman were sure to be heard of, unless they
      were acting in complicity. Why, of course, young Tom had behaved like a
      man, the rascal! and married her outright there, while he had the chance.
      It was a long guess. Still it was the only reasonable way of accounting
      for his extraordinary silence, and therefore the farmer held to it that he
      had done the deed. He argued as modern men do who think the hero, the
      upsetter of ordinary calculations, is gone from us. So, after despatching
      a letter to a friend in town to be on the outlook for son Tom, he
      continued awhile to smoke his pipe, rather elated than not, and mused on
      the shrewd manner he should adopt when Master Honeymoon did appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the middle of the second week of Richard&rsquo;s absence, Tom Bakewell
      came to Raynham for Cassandra, and privately handed a letter to the
      Eighteenth Century, containing a request for money, and a round sum. The
      Eighteenth Century was as good as her word, and gave Tom a letter in
      return, enclosing a cheque on her bankers, amply providing to keep the
      heroic engine in motion at a moderate pace. Tom went back, and Raynham and
      Lobourne slept and dreamed not of the morrow. The System, wedded to Time,
      slept, and knew not how he had been outraged&mdash;anticipated by seven
      pregnant seasons. For Time had heard the hero swear to that legalizing
      instrument, and had also registered an oath. Ah me! venerable Hebrew Time!
      he is unforgiving. Half the confusion and fever of the world comes of this
      vendetta he declares against the hapless innocents who have once done him
      a wrong. They cannot escape him. They will never outlive it. The father of
      jokes, he is himself no joke; which it seems the business of men to
      discover.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days roll round. He is their servant now. Mrs. Berry has a new satin
      gown, a beautiful bonnet, a gold brooch, and sweet gloves, presented to
      her by the hero, wherein to stand by his bride at the altar to-morrow;
      and, instead of being an old wary hen, she is as much a chicken as any of
      the party, such has been the magic of these articles. Fathers she sees
      accepting the facts produced for them by their children; a world content
      to be carved out as it pleases the hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Time brings the bridal eve, and is blest as a benefactor. The
      final arrangements are made; the bridegroom does depart; and Mrs. Berry
      lights the little bride to her bed. Lucy stops on the landing where there
      is an old clock eccentrically correct that night. &lsquo;Tis the palpitating
      pause before the gates of her transfiguration. Mrs. Berry sees her put her
      rosy finger on the One about to strike, and touch all the hours
      successively till she comes to the Twelve that shall sound &ldquo;Wife&rdquo; in her
      ears on the morrow, moving her lips the while, and looking round archly
      solemn when she has done; and that sight so catches at Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s heart
      that, not guessing Time to be the poor child&rsquo;s enemy, she endangers her
      candle by folding Lucy warmly in her arms, whimpering; &ldquo;Bless you for a
      darling! you innocent lamb! You shall be happy! You shall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Time gazes grimly ahead.

      CHAPTER XXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Although it blew hard when Caesar crossed the Rubicon, the passage of that
      river is commonly calm; calm as Acheron. So long as he gets his fare, the
      ferryman does not need to be told whom he carries: he pulls with a will,
      and heroes may be over in half-an-hour. Only when they stand on the
      opposite bank, do they see what a leap they have taken. The shores they
      have relinquished shrink to an infinite remoteness. There they have
      dreamed: here they must act. There lie youth and irresolution: here
      manhood and purpose. They are veritably in another land: a moral Acheron
      divides their life. Their memories scarce seem their own! The
      Philosophical Geography (about to be published) observes that each man
      has, one time or other, a little Rubicon&mdash;a clear or a foul water to
      cross. It is asked him: &ldquo;Wilt thou wed this Fate, and give up all behind
      thee?&rdquo; And &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; firmly pronounced, speeds him over. The above-named
      manuscript authority informs us, that by far the greater number of
      caresses rolled by this heroic flood to its sister stream below, are those
      of fellows who have repented their pledge, and have tried to swim back to
      the bank they have blotted out. For though every man of us may be a hero
      for one fatal minute, very few remain so after a day&rsquo;s march even: and who
      wonders that Madam Fate is indignant, and wears the features of the
      terrible Universal Fate to him? Fail before her, either in heart or in
      act, and lo, how the alluring loves in her visage wither and sicken to
      what it is modelled on! Be your Rubicon big or small, clear or foul, it is
      the same: you shall not return. On&mdash;or to Acheron!&mdash;I subscribe
      to that saying of The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The danger of a little knowledge of things is disputable: but beware the
      little knowledge of one&rsquo;s self!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard Feverel was now crossing the River of his Ordeal. Already the
      mists were stealing over the land he had left: his life was cut in two,
      and he breathed but the air that met his nostrils. His father, his
      father&rsquo;s love, his boyhood and ambition, were shadowy. His poetic dreams
      had taken a living attainable shape. He had a distincter impression of the
      Autumnal Berry and her household than of anything at Raynham. And yet the
      young man loved his father, loved his home: and I daresay Caesar loved
      Rome: but whether he did or no, Caesar when he killed the Republic was
      quite bald, and the hero we are dealing with is scarce beginning to feel
      his despotic moustache. Did he know what he was made of? Doubtless,
      nothing at all. But honest passion has an instinct that can be safer than
      conscious wisdom. He was an arrow drawn to the head, flying from the bow.
      His audacious mendacities and subterfuges did not strike him as in any way
      criminal; for he was perfectly sure that the winning and securing of Lucy
      would in the end be boisterously approved of, and in that case, were not
      the means justified? Not that he took trouble to argue thus, as older
      heroes and self-convicting villains are in the habit of doing; to deduce a
      clear conscience. Conscience and Lucy went together.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a soft fair day. The Rubicon sparkled in the morning sun. One of
      those days when London embraces the prospect of summer, and troops forth
      all its babies. The pavement, the squares, the parks, were early alive
      with the cries of young Britain. Violet and primrose girls, and organ boys
      with military monkeys, and systematic bands very determined in tone if not
      in tune, filled the atmosphere, and crowned the blazing procession of
      omnibuses, freighted with business men, Cityward, where a column of
      reddish brown smoke,&mdash;blown aloft by the South-west, marked the scene
      of conflict to which these persistent warriors repaired. Richard had seen
      much of early London that morning. His plans were laid. He had taken care
      to ensure his personal liberty against accidents, by leaving his hotel and
      his injured uncle Hippias at sunrise. To-day or to-morrow his father was
      to arrive. Farmer Blaize, Tom Bakewell reported to him, was raging in
      town. Another day and she might be torn from him: but to-day this miracle
      of creation would be his, and then from those glittering banks yonder, let
      them summon him to surrender her who dared! The position of things looked
      so propitious that he naturally thought the powers waiting on love
      conspired in his behalf. And she, too&mdash;since she must cross this
      river, she had sworn to him to be brave, and do him honour, and wear the
      true gladness of her heart in her face. Without a suspicion of folly in
      his acts, or fear of results, Richard strolled into Kensington Gardens,
      breakfasting on the foreshadow of his great joy, now with a vision of his
      bride, now of the new life opening to him. Mountain masses of clouds,
      rounded in sunlight, swung up the blue. The flowering chestnut pavilions
      overhead rustled and hummed. A sound in his ears as of a banner unfolding
      in the joyful distance lulled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was to meet his bride at the church at a quarter past eleven. His watch
      said a quarter to ten. He strolled on beneath the long-stemmed trees
      toward the well dedicated to a saint obscure. Some people were drinking at
      the well. A florid lady stood by a younger one, who had a little silver
      mug half-way to her mouth, and evinced undisguised dislike to the liquor
      of the salutary saint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink, child!&rdquo; said the maturer lady. &ldquo;That is only your second mug. I
      insist upon your drinking three full ones every morning we&rsquo;re in town.
      Your constitution positively requires iron!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, mama,&rdquo; the other expostulated, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s so nasty. I shall be sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink!&rdquo; was the harsh injunction. &ldquo;Nothing to the German waters, my dear.
      Here, let me taste.&rdquo; She took the mug and gave it a flying kiss. &ldquo;I
      declare I think it almost nice&mdash;not at all objectionable. Pray, taste
      it,&rdquo; she said to a gentleman standing below them to act as cup-bearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unmistakable cis-Rubicon voice replied: &ldquo;Certainly, if it&rsquo;s good
      fellowship; though I confess I don&rsquo;t think mutual sickness a very engaging
      ceremony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Can one never escape from one&rsquo;s relatives? Richard ejaculated inwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a doubt those people were Mrs. Doria, Clare, and Adrian. He had
      them under his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare, peeping up from her constitutional dose to make sure no man was
      near to see the possible consequence of it, was the first to perceive him.
      Her hand dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, pray, drink, and do not fuss!&rdquo; said Mrs. Doria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mama!&rdquo; Clare gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard came forward and capitulated honourably, since retreat was out of
      the question. Mrs. Doria swam to meet him: &ldquo;My own boy! My dear Richard!&rdquo;
       profuse of exclamations. Clare shyly greeted him. Adrian kept in the
      background.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we were coming for you to-day, Richard,&rdquo; said Mrs. Doria, smiling
      effusion; and rattled on, &ldquo;We want another cavalier. This is delightful!
      My dear nephew! You have grown from a boy to a man. And there&rsquo;s down on
      his lip! And what brings you here at such an hour in the morning? Poetry,
      I suppose! Here, take my arm, child.&mdash;Clare! finish that mug and
      thank your cousin for sparing you the third. I always bring her, when we
      are by a chalybeate, to take the waters before breakfast. We have to get
      up at unearthly hours. Think, my dear boy! Mothers are sacrifices! And so
      you&rsquo;ve been alone a fortnight with your agreeable uncle! A charming time
      of it you must have had! Poor Hippias! what may be his last nostrum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nephew!&rdquo; Adrian stretched his head round to the couple. &ldquo;Doses of nephew
      taken morning and night fourteen days! And he guarantees that it shall
      destroy an iron constitution in a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard mechanically shook Adrian&rsquo;s hand as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite well, Ricky?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: well enough,&rdquo; Richard answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; resumed his vigorous aunt, walking on with him, while Clare and
      Adrian followed. &ldquo;I really never saw you looking so handsome. There&rsquo;s
      something about your face&mdash;look at me&mdash;you needn&rsquo;t blush. You&rsquo;ve
      grown to an Apollo. That blue buttoned-up frock coat becomes you admirably&mdash;and
      those gloves, and that easy neck-tie. Your style is irreproachable, quite
      a style of your own! And nothing eccentric. You have the instinct of
      dress. Dress shows blood, my dear boy, as much as anything else. Boy!&mdash;you
      see, I can&rsquo;t forget old habits. You were a boy when I left, and now!&mdash;Do
      you see any change in him, Clare?&rdquo; she turned half round to her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard is looking very well, mama,&rdquo; said Clare, glancing at him under
      her eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could say the same of you, my dear.&mdash;Take my arm, Richard.
      Are you afraid of your aunt? I want to get used to you. Won&rsquo;t it be
      pleasant, our being all in town together in the season? How fresh the
      Opera will be to you! Austin, I hear, takes stalls. You can come to the
      Forey&rsquo;s box when you like. We are staying with the Foreys close by here. I
      think it&rsquo;s a little too far out, you know; but they like the
      neighbourhood. This is what I have always said: Give him more liberty!
      Austin has seen it at last. How do you think Clare looking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question had to be repeated. Richard surveyed his cousin hastily, and
      praised her looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pale!&rdquo; Mrs. Doria sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather pale, aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grown very much&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very tall girl indeed, aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she had but a little more colour, my dear Richard! I&rsquo;m sure I give her
      all the iron she can swallow, but that pallor still continues. I think she
      does not prosper away from her old companion. She was accustomed to look
      up to you, Richard&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you get Ralph&rsquo;s letter, aunt?&rdquo; Richard interrupted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absurd!&rdquo; Mrs. Doria pressed his arm. &ldquo;The nonsense of a boy! Why did you
      undertake to forward such stuff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain he loves her,&rdquo; said Richard, in a serious way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maternal eyes narrowed on him. &ldquo;Life, my dear Richard, is a game of
      cross-purposes,&rdquo; she observed, dropping her fluency, and was rather
      angered to hear him laugh. He excused himself by saying that she spoke so
      like his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You breakfast with us,&rdquo; she freshened off again. &ldquo;The Foreys wish to see
      you; the girls are dying to know you. Do you know, you have a reputation
      on account of that&rdquo;&mdash;she crushed an intruding adjective&mdash;&ldquo;System
      you were brought up on. You mustn&rsquo;t mind it. For my part, I think you look
      a credit to it. Don&rsquo;t be bashful with young women, mind! As much as you
      please with the old ones. You know how to behave among men. There you have
      your Drawing-room Guide! I&rsquo;m sure I shall be proud of you. Am I not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doria addressed his eyes coaxingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A benevolent idea struck Richard, that he might employ the minutes to
      spare, in pleading the case of poor Ralph; and, as he was drawn along, he
      pulled out his watch to note the precise number of minutes he could
      dedicate to this charitable office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Doria. &ldquo;You want manners, my dear boy. I think it
      never happened to me before that a man consulted his watch in my
      presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard mildly replied that he had an engagement at a particular hour, up
      to which he was her servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiddlededee!&rdquo; the vivacious lady sang. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve got you, I mean to keep
      you. Oh! I&rsquo;ve heard all about you. This ridiculous indifference that your
      father makes so much of! Why, of course, you wanted to see the world! A
      strong healthy young man shut up all his life in a lonely house&mdash;no
      friends, no society, no amusements but those of rustics! Of course you
      were indifferent! Your intelligence and superior mind alone saved you from
      becoming a dissipated country boor.&mdash;Where are the others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare and Adrian came up at a quick pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My damozel dropped something,&rdquo; Adrian explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother asked what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, mama,&rdquo; said Clare, demurely, and they proceeded as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overborne by his aunt&rsquo;s fluency of tongue, and occupied in acute
      calculation of the flying minutes, Richard let many pass before he edged
      in a word for Ralph. When he did, Mrs. Doria stopped him immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must tell you, child, that I refuse to listen to such rank idiotcy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing of the kind, aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fancy of a boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a boy. He&rsquo;s half-a-year older than I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You silly child! The moment you fall in love, you all think yourselves
      men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my honour, aunt! I believe he loves her thoroughly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he tell you so, child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men don&rsquo;t speak openly of those things,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys do,&rdquo; said Mrs. Doria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But listen to me in earnest, aunt. I want you to be kind to Ralph. Don&rsquo;t
      drive him to&mdash;You maybe sorry for it. Let him&mdash;do let him write
      to her, and see her. I believe women are as cruel as men in these things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never encourage absurdity, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What objection have you to Ralph, aunt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re both good families. It&rsquo;s not that absurdity, Richard. It will
      be to his credit to remember that his first fancy wasn&rsquo;t a dairymaid.&rdquo;
       Mrs. Doria pitched her accent tellingly. It did not touch her nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want Clare ever to marry?&rdquo; He put the last point of reason to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doria laughed. &ldquo;I hope so, child. We must find some comfortable old
      gentleman for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What infamy!&rdquo; mutters Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I engage Ralph shall be ready to dance at her wedding, or eat a
      hearty breakfast&mdash;We don&rsquo;t dance at weddings now, and very properly.
      It&rsquo;s a horrid sad business, not to be treated with levity.&mdash;Is that
      his regiment?&rdquo; she said, as they passed out of the hussar-sentinelled
      gardens. &ldquo;Tush, tush, child! Master Ralph will recover, as&mdash;hem!
      others have done. A little headache&mdash;you call it heartache&mdash;and
      up you rise again, looking better than ever. No doubt, to have a grain of
      sense forced into your brains, you poor dear children! must be painful..
      Girls suffer as much as boys, I assure you. More, for their heads are
      weaker, and their appetites less constant. Do I talk like your father now?
      Whatever makes the boy fidget at his watch so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard stopped short. Time spoke urgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face did not seem good for trifling. Mrs. Doria would trifle in spite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Clare! Richard is going. He says he has an engagement. What
      possible engagement can a young man have at eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning?&mdash;unless
      it&rsquo;s to be married!&rdquo; Mrs. Doria laughed at the ingenuity of her
      suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the church handy, Ricky?&rdquo; said Adrian. &ldquo;You can still give us
      half-an-hour if it is. The celibate hours strike at Twelve.&rdquo; And he also
      laughed in his fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you stay with us, Richard?&rdquo; Clare asked. She blushed timidly, and
      her voice shook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something indefinite&mdash;a sharp-edged thrill in the tones made the
      burning bridegroom speak gently to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I would, Clare; I should like to please you, but I have a most
      imperative appointment&mdash;that is, I promised&mdash;I must go. I shall
      see you again&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doria, took forcible possession of him. &ldquo;Now, do come, and don&rsquo;t
      waste words. I insist upon your having some breakfast first, and then, if
      you really must go, you shall. Look! there&rsquo;s the house. At least you will
      accompany your aunt to the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard conceded this. She little imagined what she required of him. Two
      of his golden minutes melted into nothingness. They were growing to be
      jewels of price, one by one more and more precious as they ran, and now so
      costly-rare&mdash;rich as his blood! not to kindest relations, dearest
      friends, could he give another. The die is cast! Ferryman! push off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; he cried, nodding bluffly at the three as one, and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      They watched his abrupt muscular stride through the grounds of the house.
      He looked like resolution on the march. Mrs. Doria, as usual with her out
      of her brother&rsquo;s hearing, began rating the System.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what becomes of that nonsensical education! The boy really does not
      know how to behave like a common mortal. He has some paltry appointment,
      or is mad after some ridiculous idea of his own, and everything must be
      sacrificed to it! That&rsquo;s what Austin calls concentration of the faculties.
      I think it&rsquo;s more likely to lead to downright insanity than to greatness
      of any kind. And so I shall tell Austin. It&rsquo;s time he should be spoken to
      seriously about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an engine, my dear aunt,&rdquo; said Adrian. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a boy, or a man,
      but an engine. And he appears to have been at high pressure since he came
      to town&mdash;out all day and half the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s mad!&rdquo; Mrs. Doria interjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. Extremely shrewd is Master Ricky, and carries as open an eye
      ahead of him as the ships before Troy. He&rsquo;s more than a match for any of
      us. He is for me, I confess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Mrs. Doria, &ldquo;he does astonish me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian begged her to retain her astonishment till the right season, which
      would not be long arriving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their common wisdom counselled them not to tell the Foreys of their
      hopeful relative&rsquo;s ungracious behaviour. Clare had left them. When Mrs.
      Doria went to her room her daughter was there, gazing down at something in
      her hand, which she guiltily closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In answer to an inquiry why she had not gone to take off her things, Clare
      said she was not hungry. Mrs. Doria lamented the obstinacy of a
      constitution that no quantity of iron could affect, and eclipsed the
      looking-glass, saying: &ldquo;Take them off here, child, and learn to assist
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She disentangled her bonnet from the array of her spreading hair, talking
      of Richard, and his handsome appearance, and extraordinary conduct. Clare
      kept opening and shutting her hand, in an attitude half-pensive,
      half-listless. She did not stir to undress. A joyless dimple hung in one
      pale cheek, and she drew long even breaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doria, assured by the glass that she was ready to show, came to her
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, really,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are too helpless, my dear. You cannot do a
      thing without a dozen women at your elbow. What will become of you? You
      will have to marry a millionaire.&mdash;What&rsquo;s the matter with you,
      child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clare undid her tight-shut fingers, as if to some attraction of her eyes,
      and displayed a small gold hoop on the palm of a green glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wedding-ring!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Doria, inspecting the curiosity most
      daintily.
    </p>
    <p>
      There on Clare&rsquo;s pale green glove lay a wedding-ring!
    </p>
    <p>
      Rapid questions as to where, when, how, it was found, beset Clare, who
      replied: &ldquo;In the Gardens, mama. This morning. When I was walking behind
      Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure he did not give it you, Clare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, mama! he did not give it me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not! only he does such absurd things! I thought, perhaps&mdash;these
      boys are so exceedingly ridiculous! Mrs. Doria had an idea that it might
      have been concerted between the two young gentlemen, Richard and Ralph,
      that the former should present this token of hymeneal devotion from the
      latter to the young lady of his love; but a moment&rsquo;s reflection exonerated
      boys even from such preposterous behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I wonder,&rdquo; she speculated on Clare&rsquo;s cold face, &ldquo;I do wonder whether
      it&rsquo;s lucky to find a wedding-ring. What very quick eyes you have, my
      darling!&rdquo; Mrs. Doria kissed her. She thought it must be lucky, and the
      circumstance made her feel tender to her child. Her child did not move to
      the kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see whether it fits,&rdquo; said Mrs. Doria, almost infantine with
      surprise and pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare suffered her glove to be drawn off. The ring slid down her long thin
      finger, and settled comfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does!&rdquo; Mrs. Doria whispered. To find a wedding ring is open to any
      woman; but to find a wedding-ring that fits may well cause a superstitious
      emotion. Moreover, that it should be found while walking in the
      neighbourhood of the identical youth whom a mother has destined for her
      daughter, gives significance to the gentle perturbation of ideas
      consequent on such a hint from Fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It really fits!&rdquo; she pursued. &ldquo;Now I never pay any attention to the
      nonsense of omens and that kind of thing&rdquo; (had the ring been a horseshoe
      Mrs. Doria would have pinked it up and dragged it obediently home), &ldquo;but
      this, I must say, is odd&mdash;to find a ring that fits!&mdash;singular!
      It never happened to me. Sixpence is the most I ever discovered, and I
      have it now. Mind you keep it, Clare&mdash;this ring: And,&rdquo; she laughed,
      &ldquo;offer it to Richard when he comes; say, you think he must have dropped
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dimple in Clare&rsquo;s cheek quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother and daughter had never spoken explicitly of Richard. Mrs. Doria, by
      exquisite management, had contrived to be sure that on one side there
      would be no obstacle to her project of general happiness, without, as she
      thought, compromising her daughter&rsquo;s feelings unnecessarily. It could do
      no harm to an obedient young girl to hear that there was no youth in the
      world like a certain youth. He the prince of his generation, she might
      softly consent, when requested, to be his princess; and if never requested
      (for Mrs. Doria envisaged failure), she might easily transfer her softness
      to squires of lower degree. Clare had always been blindly obedient to her
      mother (Adrian called them Mrs. Doria Battledoria and the fair
      Shuttlecockiana), and her mother accepted in this blind obedience the text
      of her entire character. It is difficult for those who think very
      earnestly for their children to know when their children are thinking on
      their own account. The exercise of their volition we construe as revolt.
      Our love does not like to be invalided and deposed from its command, and
      here I think yonder old thrush on the lawn who has just kicked the last of
      her lank offspring out of the nest to go shift for itself, much the kinder
      of the two, though sentimental people do shrug their shoulders at these
      unsentimental acts of the creatures who never wander from nature. Now,
      excess of obedience is, to one who manages most exquisitely, as bad as
      insurrection. Happily Mrs. Doria saw nothing in her daughter&rsquo;s manner save
      a want of iron. Her pallor, her lassitude, the tremulous nerves in her
      face, exhibited an imperious requirement of the mineral.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reason why men and women are mysterious to us, and prove
      disappointing,&rdquo; we learn from The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip, &ldquo;is, that we will read
      them from our own book; just as we are perplexed by reading ourselves from
      theirs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doria read her daughter from her own book, and she was gay; she
      laughed with Adrian at the breakfast-table, and mock-seriously joined in
      his jocose assertion that Clare was positively and by all hymeneal
      auspices betrothed to the owner of that ring, be he who he may, and must,
      whenever he should choose to come and claim her, give her hand to him (for
      everybody agreed the owner must be masculine, as no woman would drop a
      wedding-ring), and follow him whither he listed all the world over.
      Amiable giggling Forey girls called Clare, The Betrothed. Dark man, or
      fair? was mooted. Adrian threw off the first strophe of Clare&rsquo;s fortune in
      burlesque rhymes, with an insinuating gipsy twang. Her aunt Forey warned
      her to have her dresses in readiness. Her grandpapa Forey pretended to
      grumble at bridal presents being expected from grandpapas.
    </p>
    <p>
      This one smelt orange-flower, another spoke solemnly of an old shoe. The
      finding of a wedding-ring was celebrated through all the palpitating
      accessories and rosy ceremonies involved by that famous instrument. In the
      midst of the general hilarity, Clare showed her deplorable want of iron by
      bursting into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did the poor mocked-at heart divine what might be then enacting? Perhaps,
      dimly, as we say: that is, without eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At an altar stand two fair young creatures, ready with their oaths. They
      are asked to fix all time to the moment, and they do so. If there is
      hesitation at the immense undertaking, it is but maidenly. She conceives
      as little mental doubt of the sanity of the act as he. Over them hangs a
      cool young curate in his raiment of office. Behind are two apparently
      lucid people, distinguished from each other by sex and age: the foremost a
      bunch of simmering black satin; under her shadow a cock-robin in the dress
      of a gentleman, big joy swelling out his chest, and pert satisfaction
      cocking his head. These be they who stand here in place of parents to the
      young couple. All is well. The service proceeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firmly the bridegroom tells forth his words. This hour of the complacent
      giant at least is his, and that he means to hold him bound through the
      eternities, men may hear. Clearly, and with brave modesty, speaks she: no
      less firmly, though her body trembles: her voice just vibrating while the
      tone travels on, like a smitten vase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time hears sentence pronounced on him: the frail hands bind his huge limbs
      and lock the chains. He is used to it: he lets them do as they will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then comes that period when they are to give their troth to each other.
      The Man with his right hand takes the Woman by her right hand: the Woman
      with her right hand takes the Man by his right hand.&mdash;Devils dare not
      laugh at whom Angels crowd to contemplate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their hands are joined; their blood flows as one stream. Adam and fair Eve
      front the generations. Are they not lovely? Purer fountains of life were
      never in two bosoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then they loose their hands, and the cool curate doth bid the Man to
      put a ring on the Woman&rsquo;s fourth finger, counting thumb. And the Man
      thrusts his hand into one pocket, and into another, forward and back many
      times into all his pockets. He remembers that he felt for it, and felt it
      in his waistcoat pocket, when in the Gardens. And his hand comes forth
      empty. And the Man is ghastly to look at!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, though Angels smile, shall not Devils laugh! The curate deliberates.
      The black satin bunch ceases to simmer. He in her shadow changes from a
      beaming cock-robin to an inquisitive sparrow. Eyes multiply questions:
      lips have no reply. Time ominously shakes his chain, and in the pause a
      sound of mockery stings their ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think ye a hero is one to be defeated in his first battle? Look at the
      clock! there are but seven minutes to the stroke of the celibate hours:
      the veteran is surely lifting his two hands to deliver fire, and his shot
      will sunder them in twain so nearly united. All the jewellers of London
      speeding down with sacks full of the nuptial circlet cannot save them!
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle must be won on the field, and what does the hero now? It is an
      inspiration! For who else would dream of such a reserve in the rear? None
      see what he does; only that the black-satin bunch is remonstratingly
      agitated, stormily shaken, and subdued: and as though the menacing cloud
      had opened, and dropped the dear token from the skies at his demand, he
      produces the symbol of their consent, and the service proceeds: &ldquo;With this
      ring I thee wed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They are prayed over and blest. For good, or for ill, this deed is done.
      The names are registered; fees fly right and left: they thank, and salute,
      the curate, whose official coolness melts into a smile of monastic
      gallantry: the beadle on the steps waves off a gaping world as they issue
      forth bridegroom and bridesman recklessly scatter gold on him: carriage
      doors are banged to: the coachmen drive off, and the scene closes,
      everybody happy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX
    </h2>
    <p>
      And the next moment the bride is weeping as if she would dissolve to one
      of Dian&rsquo;s Virgin Fountains from the clasp of the Sun-God. She has nobly
      preserved the mask imposed by comedies, till the curtain has fallen, and
      now she weeps, streams with tears. Have patience, O impetuous young man!
      It is your profession to be a hero. This poor heart is new to it, and her
      duties involve such wild acts, such brigandage, such terrors and tasks,
      she is quite unnerved. She did you honour till now. Bear with her now. She
      does not cry the cry of ordinary maidens in like cases. While the struggle
      went on her tender face was brave; but, alas! Omens are against her: she
      holds an ever-present dreadful one on that fatal fourth finger of hers,
      which has coiled itself round her dream of delight, and takes her in its
      clutch like a horrid serpent. And yet she must love it. She dares not part
      from it. She must love and hug it, and feed on its strange honey, and all
      the bliss it gives her casts all the deeper shadow on what is to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Say: Is it not enough to cause feminine apprehension, for a woman to be
      married in another woman&rsquo;s ring?
    </p>
    <p>
      You are amazons, ladies, at Saragossa, and a thousand citadels&mdash;wherever
      there is strife, and Time is to be taken by the throat. Then shall few men
      match your sublime fury. But what if you see a vulture, visible only to
      yourselves, hovering over the house you are gaily led by the torch to
      inhabit? Will you not crouch and be cowards?
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the hero, in the hour of victory he pays no heed to omens. He does
      his best to win his darling to confidence by caresses. Is she not his? Is
      he not hers? And why, when the battle is won, does she weep? Does she
      regret what she has done?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, never! never! her soft blue eyes assure him, steadfast love seen
      swimming on clear depths of faith in them, through the shower.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is silenced by her exceeding beauty, and sits perplexed waiting for the
      shower to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone with Mrs. Berry, in her bedroom, Lucy gave tongue to her distress,
      and a second character in the comedy changed her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Mrs. Berry! Mrs. Berry! what has happened! what has happened!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darlin&rsquo; child!&rdquo; The bridal Berry gazed at the finger of doleful joy.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgot all about it! And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;ve made me feel so queer ever
      since, then! I&rsquo;ve been seemin&rsquo; as if I wasn&rsquo;t myself somehow, without my
      ring. Dear! dear! what a wilful young gentleman! We ain&rsquo;t a match for men
      in that state&mdash;Lord help us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry sat on the edge of a chair: Lucy on the edge of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of it, Mrs. Berry? Is it not terrible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I should &lsquo;a liked it myself, my dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Berry candidly
      responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! why, why, why did it happen!&rdquo; the young bride bent to a flood of
      fresh tears, murmuring that she felt already old&mdash;forsaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got a comfort in your religion for all accidents?&rdquo; Mrs. Berry
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None for this. I know it&rsquo;s wrong to cry when I am so happy. I hope he
      will forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry vowed her bride was the sweetest, softest, beautifulest thing
      in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cry no more,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;Leave me, Mrs. Berry, and come back when I
      ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew forth a little silver cross, and fell upon her knees to the bed.
      Mrs. Berry left the room tiptoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was called to return, Lucy was calm and tearless, and smiled
      kindly to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s over now,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry sedately looked for her ring to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not wish me to go in to the breakfast you have prepared, Mrs.
      Berry. I begged to be excused. I cannot eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry very much deplored it, as she had laid out a superior nuptial
      breakfast, but with her mind on her ring she nodded assentingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall not have much packing to do, Mrs. Berry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear. It&rsquo;s pretty well all done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going to the Isle of Wight, Mrs. Berry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a very suitable spot ye&rsquo;ve chose, my dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He loves the sea. He wishes to be near it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ye cross to-night, if it&rsquo;s anyways rough, my dear. It isn&rsquo;t
      advisable.&rdquo; Mrs. Berry sank her voice to say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ye be soft and give
      way to him there, or you&rsquo;ll both be repenting it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy had only been staving off the unpleasantness she had to speak. She
      saw Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s eyes pursuing her ring, and screwed up her courage at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Berry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Berry, you shall have another ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another, my dear?&rdquo; Berry did not comprehend. &ldquo;One&rsquo;s quite enough for the
      objeck,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; Lucy touched her fourth finger, &ldquo;I cannot part with this.&rdquo; She
      looked straight at Mrs. Berry.
    </p>
    <p>
      That bewildered creature gazed at her, and at the ring, till she had
      thoroughly exhausted the meaning of the words, and then exclaimed,
      horror-struck: &ldquo;Deary me, now! you don&rsquo;t say that? You&rsquo;re to be married
      again in your own religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young wife repeated: &ldquo;I can never part with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear!&rdquo; the wretched Berry wrung her hands, divided between
      compassion and a sense of injury. &ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; she kept expostulating like a
      mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all that you would say, Mrs. Berry. I am very grieved to pain you.
      It is mine now, and must be mine. I cannot give it back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There she sat, suddenly developed to the most inflexible little heroine in
      the three Kingdoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      From her first perception of the meaning of the young bride&rsquo;s words, Mrs.
      Berry, a shrewd physiognomist, knew that her case was hopeless, unless she
      treated her as she herself had been treated, and seized the ring by force
      of arms; and that she had not heart for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; she gasped faintly, &ldquo;one&rsquo;s own lawful wedding-ring you wouldn&rsquo;t
      give back to a body?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is mine, Mrs. Berry. It was yours, but it is mine now. You
      shall have whatever you ask for but that. Pray, forgive me! It must be
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry rocked on her chair, and sounded her hands together. It amazed
      her that this soft little creature could be thus firm. She tried argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ye know, my dear, it&rsquo;s the fatalest thing you&rsquo;re inflictin&rsquo; upon
      me, reelly! Don&rsquo;t ye know that bein&rsquo; bereft of one&rsquo;s own lawful
      wedding-ring&rsquo;s the fatalest thing in life, and there&rsquo;s no prosperity after
      it! For what stands in place o&rsquo; that, when that&rsquo;s gone, my dear? And what
      could ye give me to compensate a body for the loss o&rsquo; that? Don&rsquo;t ye know&mdash;Oh,
      deary me!&rdquo; The little bride&rsquo;s face was so set that poor Berry wailed off
      in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;I know it all. I know what I do to you. Dear,
      dear Mrs. Berry! forgive me! If I parted with my ring I know it would be
      fatal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So this fair young freebooter took possession of her argument as well as
      her ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Berry racked her distracted wits for a further appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my child,&rdquo; she counter-argued, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t understand. It ain&rsquo;t as
      you think. It ain&rsquo;t a hurt to you now. Not a bit, it ain&rsquo;t. It makes no
      difference now! Any ring does while the wearer&rsquo;s a maid. And your Mr.
      Richard will find the very ring he intended for ye. And, of course, that&rsquo;s
      the one you&rsquo;ll wear as his wife. It&rsquo;s all the same now, my dear. It&rsquo;s no
      shame to a maid. Now do&mdash;now do&mdash;there&rsquo;s a darlin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wheedling availed as little as argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Berry,&rdquo; said Lucy, &ldquo;you know what my&mdash;he spoke: &lsquo;With this ring
      I thee wed.&rsquo; It was with this ring. Then how could it be with another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Berry was constrained despondently to acknowledge that was logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hit upon an artful conjecture:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it be unlucky your wearin&rsquo; of the ring which served me so? Think o&rsquo; 
      that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may! it may! it may!&rdquo; cried Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And arn&rsquo;t you rushin&rsquo; into it, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Berry,&rdquo; Lucy said again, &ldquo;it was this ring. It cannot&mdash;it never
      can be another. It was this. What it brings me I must bear. I shall wear
      it till I die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what am I to do?&rdquo; the ill-used woman groaned. &ldquo;What shall I tell my
      husband when he come back to me, and see I&rsquo;ve got a new ring waitin&rsquo; for
      him? Won&rsquo;t that be a welcome?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quoth Lucy: &ldquo;How can he know it is not the same; in a plain gold ring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never see so keen a eyed man in joolry as my Berry!&rdquo; returned his
      solitary spouse. &ldquo;Not know, my dear? Why, any one would know that&rsquo;ve got
      eyes in his head. There&rsquo;s as much difference in wedding-rings as there&rsquo;s
      in wedding people! Now, do pray be reasonable, my own sweet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, do not ask me,&rdquo; pleads Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, do think better of it,&rdquo; urges Berry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, pray, Mrs. Berry!&rdquo; pleads Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;And not leave your old Berry all forlorn just when you&rsquo;re so
      happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I would not, you dear, kind old creature!&rdquo; Lucy faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry thought she had her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just when you&rsquo;re going to be the happiest wife on earth&mdash;all you
      want yours!&rdquo; she pursued the tender strain. &ldquo;A handsome young gentleman!
      Love and Fortune smilin&rsquo; on ye!&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy rose up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Berry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think we must not lose time in getting ready,
      or he will be impatient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Berry surveyed her in abject wonder from the edge of her chair.
      Dignity and resolve were in the ductile form she had hitherto folded under
      her wing. In an hour the heroine had risen to the measure of the hero.
      Without being exactly aware what creature she was dealing with, Berry
      acknowledged to herself it was not one of the common run, and sighed, and
      submitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a divorce, that it is!&rdquo; she sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After putting the corners of her apron to her eyes, Berry bustled humbly
      about the packing. Then Lucy, whose heart was full to her, came and kissed
      her, and Berry bumped down and regularly cried. This over, she had
      recourse to fatalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it was to be, my dear! It&rsquo;s my punishment for meddlin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; such
      matters. No, I&rsquo;m not sorry. Bless ye both. Who&rsquo;d &lsquo;a thought you was so
      wilful?&mdash;you that any one might have taken for one of the
      silly-softs! You&rsquo;re a pair, my dear! indeed you are! You was made to meet!
      But we mustn&rsquo;t show him we&rsquo;ve been crying.&mdash;Men don&rsquo;t like it when
      they&rsquo;re happy. Let&rsquo;s wash our faces and try to bear our lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying the black-satin bunch careened to a renewed deluge. She deserved
      some sympathy, for if it is sad to be married in another person&rsquo;s ring,
      how much sadder to have one&rsquo;s own old accustomed lawful ring violently
      torn off one&rsquo;s finger and eternally severed from one! But where you have
      heroes and heroines, these terrible complications ensue.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had now both fought their battle of the ring, and with equal honour
      and success.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the chamber of banquet Richard was giving Ripton his last directions.
      Though it was a private wedding, Mrs. Berry had prepared a sumptuous
      breakfast. Chickens offered their breasts: pies hinted savoury secrets:
      things mystic, in a mash, with Gallic appellatives, jellies, creams,
      fruits, strewed the table: as a tower in the midst, the cake colossal: the
      priestly vesture of its nuptial white relieved by hymeneal splendours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many hours, much labour and anxiety of mind, Mrs. Berry had expended upon
      this breakfast, and why? There is one who comes to all feasts that have
      their basis in Folly, whom criminals of trained instinct are careful to
      provide against: who will speak, and whose hateful voice must somehow be
      silenced while the feast is going on. This personage is The Philosopher.
      Mrs. Berry knew him. She knew that he would come. She provided against him
      in the manner she thought most efficacious: that is, by cheating her eyes
      and intoxicating her conscience with the due and proper glories incident
      to weddings where fathers dilate, mothers collapse, and marriage
      settlements are flourished on high by the family lawyer: and had there
      been no show of the kind to greet her on her return from the church, she
      would, and she foresaw she would, have stared at squalor and emptiness,
      and repented her work. The Philosopher would have laid hold of her by the
      ear, and called her bad names. Entrenched behind a breakfast-table so
      legitimately adorned, Mrs. Berry defied him. In the presence of that cake
      he dared not speak above a whisper. And there were wines to drown him in,
      should he still think of protesting; fiery wines, and cool: claret sent
      purposely by the bridegroom for the delectation of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one good hour, therefore, the labour of many hours kept him dumb.
      Ripton was fortifying himself so as to forget him altogether, and the
      world as well, till the next morning. Ripton was excited, overdone with
      delight. He had already finished one bottle, and listened, pleasantly
      flushed, to his emphatic and more abstemious chief. He had nothing to do
      but to listen, and to drink. The hero would not allow him to shout
      Victory! or hear a word of toasts; and as, from the quantity of oil poured
      on it, his eloquence was becoming a natural force in his bosom, the poor
      fellow was afflicted with a sort of elephantiasis of suppressed emotion.
      At times he half-rose from his chair, and fell vacuously into it again; or
      he chuckled in the face of weighty, severely-worded instructions; tapped
      his chest, stretched his arms, yawned, and in short behaved so singularly
      that Richard observed it, and said: &ldquo;On my soul, I don&rsquo;t think you know a
      word I&rsquo;m saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every word, Ricky!&rdquo; Ripton spirted through the opening. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down
      to your governor, and tell him: Sir Austin! Here&rsquo;s your only chance of
      being a happy father&mdash;no, no!&mdash;Oh! don&rsquo;t you fear me, Ricky! I
      shall talk the old gentleman over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His chief said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here. You had better not go down to-night. Go down the first thing
      to-morrow, by the six o&rsquo;clock train. Give him my letter. Listen to me&mdash;give
      him my letter, and don&rsquo;t speak a word till he speaks. His eyebrows will go
      up and down, he won&rsquo;t say much. I know him. If he asks you about her,
      don&rsquo;t be a fool, but say what you think of her sensibly&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      No cork could hold in Ripton when she was alluded to. He shouted: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
      an angel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard checked him: &ldquo;Speak sensibly, I say&mdash;quietly. You can say how
      gentle and good she is&mdash;my fleur-de-luce! And say, this was not her
      doing. If any one&rsquo;s to blame, it&rsquo;s I. I made her marry me. Then go to Lady
      Blandish, if you don&rsquo;t find her at the house. You may say whatever you
      please to her. Give her my letter, and tell her I want to hear from her
      immediately. She has seen Lucy, and I know what she thinks of her. You
      will then go to Farmer Blaize. I told you Lucy happens to be his niece&mdash;she
      has not lived long there. She lived with her aunt Desborough in France
      while she was a child, and can hardly be called a relative to the farmer&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      not a point of likeness between them. Poor darling! she never knew her
      mother. Go to Mr. Blaize, and tell him. You will treat him just as you
      would treat any other gentleman. If you are civil, he is sure to be. And
      if he abuses me, for my sake and hers you will still treat him with
      respect. You hear? And then write me a full account of all that has been
      said and done. You will have my address the day after to-morrow. By the
      way, Tom will be here this afternoon. Write out for him where to call on
      you the day after to-morrow, in case you have heard anything in the
      morning you think I ought to know at once, as Tom will join me that night.
      Don&rsquo;t mention to anybody about my losing the ring, Ripton. I wouldn&rsquo;t have
      Adrian get hold of that for a thousand pounds. How on earth I came to lose
      it! How well she bore it, Rip! How beautifully she behaved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton again shouted: &ldquo;An angel!&rdquo; Throwing up the heels of his second
      bottle, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may trust your friend, Richard. Aha! when you pulled at old Mrs.
      Berry I didn&rsquo;t know what was up. I do wish you&rsquo;d let me drink her health?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to Penelope!&rdquo; said Richard, just wetting his mouth. The carriage
      was at the door: a couple of dire organs, each grinding the same tune, and
      a vulture-scented itinerant band (from which not the secretest veiled
      wedding can escape) worked harmoniously without in the production of
      discord, and the noise acting on his nervous state made him begin to fume
      and send in messages for his bride by the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by the lovely young bride presented herself dressed for her
      journey, and smiling from stained eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry was requested to drink some wine, which Ripton poured out for
      her, enabling Mrs. Berry thereby to measure his condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bride now kissed Mrs. Berry, and Mrs. Berry kissed the bridegroom, on
      the plea of her softness. Lucy gave Ripton her hand, with a musical
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Mr. Thompson,&rdquo; and her extreme graciousness made him just
      sensible enough to sit down before he murmured his fervent hopes for her
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall take good care of him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry, focussing her eyes to
      the comprehension of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, Penelope!&rdquo; cried Richard. &ldquo;I shall tell the police everywhere
      to look out for your lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh my dears! good-bye, and Heaven bless ye both!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Berry quavered, touched with compunction at the thoughts of approaching
      loneliness. Ripton, his mouth drawn like a bow to his ears, brought up the
      rear to the carriage, receiving a fair slap on the cheek from an old shoe
      precipitated by Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s enthusiastic female domestic.
    </p>
    <p>
      White handkerchiefs were waved, the adieux had fallen to signs: they were
      off. Then did a thought of such urgency illumine Mrs. Berry, that she
      telegraphed, hand in air; awakening Ripton&rsquo;s lungs, for the coachman to
      stop, and ran back to the house. Richard chafed to be gone, but at his
      bride&rsquo;s intercession he consented to wait. Presently they beheld the old
      black-satin bunch stream through the street-door, down the bit of garden,
      and up the astonished street; halting, panting, capless at the carriage
      door, a book in her hand,&mdash;a much-used, dog-leaved, steamy, greasy
      book, which; at the same time calling out in breathless jerks, &ldquo;There!
      never ye mind looks! I ain&rsquo;t got a new one. Read it, and don&rsquo;t ye forget
      it!&rdquo; she discharged into Lucy&rsquo;s lap, and retreated to the railings, a
      signal for the coachman to drive away for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      How Richard laughed at the Berry&rsquo;s bridal gift! Lucy, too, lost the omen
      at her heart as she glanced at the title of the volume. It was Dr.
      Kitchener on Domestic Cookery!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      General withdrawing of heads from street-windows, emigration of organs and
      bands, and a relaxed atmosphere in the circle of Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s abode,
      proved that Dan Cupid had veritably flown to suck the life of fresh
      regions. With a pensive mind she grasped Ripton&rsquo;s arm to regulate his
      steps, and returned to the room where her creditor awaited her. In the
      interval he had stormed her undefended fortress, the cake, from which
      altitude he shook a dolorous head at the guilty woman. She smoothed her
      excited apron, sighing. Let no one imagine that she regretted her
      complicity. She was ready to cry torrents, but there must be absolute
      castigation before this criminal shall conceive the sense of regret; and
      probably then she will cling to her wickedness the more&mdash;such is the
      born Pagan&rsquo;s tenacity! Mrs. Berry sighed, and gave him back his shake of
      the head. O you wanton, improvident creature! said he. O you very wise old
      gentleman! said she. He asked her the thing she had been doing. She
      enlightened him with the fatalist&rsquo;s reply. He sounded a bogey&rsquo;s alarm of
      contingent grave results. She retreated to the entrenched camp of the fact
      she had helped to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s done!&rdquo; she exclaimed. How could she regret what she felt comfort to
      know was done? Convinced that events alone could stamp a mark on such
      stubborn flesh, he determined to wait for them, and crouched silent on the
      cake, with one finger downwards at Ripton&rsquo;s incision there, showing a
      crumbling chasm and gloomy rich recess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eloquent indication was understood. &ldquo;Dear! dear!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Berry,
      &ldquo;what a heap o&rsquo; cake, and no one to send it to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton had resumed his seat by the table and his embrace of the claret.
      Clear ideas of satisfaction had left him and resolved to a boiling geysir
      of indistinguishable transports. He bubbled, and waggled, and nodded
      amicably to nothing, and successfully, though not without effort,
      preserved his uppermost member from the seductions of the nymph,
      Gravitation, who was on the look-out for his whole length shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; he shouted, about a minute after Mrs. Berry had spoken, and
      almost abandoned himself to the nymph on the spot. Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s words had
      just reached his wits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you laugh, young man?&rdquo; she inquired, familiar and motherly on
      account of his condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton laughed louder, and caught his chest on the edge of the table and
      his nose on a chicken. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s goo&rsquo;!&rdquo; he said, recovering, and rocking
      under Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;No friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say, no friend,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;I said, no one; meanin&rsquo;, I know
      not where for to send it to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton&rsquo;s response to this was: &ldquo;You put a Griffin on that cake.
      Wheatsheaves each side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His crest?&rdquo; Mrs. Berry said sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oldest baronetcy &lsquo;n England!&rdquo; waved Ripton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Mrs. Berry encouraged him on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think he&rsquo;s Richards. We&rsquo;re oblige&rsquo; be very close. And she&rsquo;s the most
      lovely!&mdash;If I hear man say thing &lsquo;gainst her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t for to cry over her, young man,&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry. &ldquo;I wanted
      for to drink their right healths by their right names, and then go about
      my day&rsquo;s work, and I do hope you won&rsquo;t keep me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton stood bolt upright at her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do?&rdquo; he said, and filling a bumper he with cheerfully vinous
      articulation and glibness of tongue proposed the health of Richard and
      Lucy Feverel, of Raynham Abbey! and that mankind should not require an
      expeditious example of the way to accept the inspiring toast, he drained
      his bumper at a gulp. It finished him. The farthing rushlight of his
      reason leapt and expired. He tumbled to the sofa and there stretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some minutes subsequent to Ripton&rsquo;s signalization of his devotion to the
      bridal pair, Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s maid entered the room to say that a gentleman
      was inquiring below after the young gentleman who had departed, and found
      her mistress with a tottering wineglass in her hand, exhibiting every
      symptom of unconsoled hysterics. Her mouth gaped, as if the fell creditor
      had her by the swallow. She ejaculated with horrible exultation that she
      had been and done it, as her disastrous aspect seemed to testify, and her
      evident, but inexplicable, access of misery induced the sympathetic maid
      to tender those caressing words that were all Mrs. Berry wanted to go off
      into the self-caressing fit without delay; and she had already given the
      preluding demoniac ironic outburst, when the maid called heaven to witness
      that the gentleman would hear her; upon which Mrs. Berry violently
      controlled her bosom, and ordered that he should be shown upstairs
      instantly to see her the wretch she was. She repeated the injunction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid did as she was told, and Mrs. Berry, wishing first to see herself
      as she was, mutely accosted the looking-glass, and tried to look a very
      little better. She dropped a shawl on Ripton and was settled, smoothing
      her agitation when her visitor was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman was Adrian Harley. An interview with Tom Bakewell had put
      him on the track, and now a momentary survey of the table, and its
      white-vestured cake, made him whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry plaintively begged him to do her the favour to be seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fine morning, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It have been!&rdquo; Mrs. Berry answered, glancing over her shoulder at the
      window, and gulping as if to get her heart down from her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very fine Spring,&rdquo; pursued Adrian, calmly anatomizing her countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry smothered an adjective to &ldquo;weather&rdquo; on a deep sigh. Her
      wretchedness was palpable. In proportion to it, Adrian waned cheerful and
      brisk. He divined enough of the business to see that there was some
      strange intelligence to be fished out of the culprit who sat compressing
      hysterics before him; and as he was never more in his element than when he
      had a sinner, and a repentant prostrate abject sinner in hand, his affable
      countenance might well deceive poor Berry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume these are Mr. Thompson&rsquo;s lodgings?&rdquo; he remarked, with a look at
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s head and the whites of her eyes informed him that they were
      not Mr. Thompson&rsquo;s lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo; said Adrian, and threw a carelessly inquisitive eye about him. &ldquo;Mr.
      Feverel is out, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A convulsive start at the name, and two corroborating hands dropped on her
      knees, formed Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Feverel&rsquo;s man,&rdquo; continued Adrian, &ldquo;told me I should be certain to
      find him here. I thought he would be with his friend, Mr. Thompson. I&rsquo;m
      too late, I perceive. Their entertainment is over. I fancy you have been
      having a party of them here, ma&rsquo;am?&mdash;a bachelors&rsquo; breakfast!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the presence of that cake this observation seemed to mask an irony so
      shrewd that Mrs. Berry could barely contain herself. She felt she must
      speak. Making her face as deplorably propitiating as she could, she began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, may I beg for to know your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harley accorded her request.
    </p>
    <p>
      Groaning in the clutch of a pitiless truth, she continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are Mr. Harley, that was&mdash;oh! and you&rsquo;ve come for Mr.?&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Richard Feverel was the gentleman Mr. Harley had come for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! and it&rsquo;s no mistake, and he&rsquo;s of Raynham Abbey?&rdquo; Mrs. Berry inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian, very much amused, assured her that he was born and bred there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father&rsquo;s Sir Austin?&rdquo; wailed the black-satin bunch from behind her
      handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian verified Richard&rsquo;s descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then, what have I been and done!&rdquo; she cried, and stared blankly at
      her visitor. &ldquo;I been and married my baby! I been and married the bread out
      of my own mouth. O Mr. Harley! Mr. Harley! I knew you when you was a boy
      that big, and wore jackets; and all of you. And it&rsquo;s my softness that&rsquo;s my
      ruin, for I never can resist a man&rsquo;s asking. Look at that cake, Mr.
      Harley!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian followed her directions quite coolly. &ldquo;Wedding-cake, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bride-cake it is, Mr. Harley!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you make it yourself, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The quiet ease of the question overwhelmed Mrs. Berry and upset that train
      of symbolic representations by which she was seeking to make him guess the
      catastrophe and spare her the furnace of confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not make it myself, Mr. Harley,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bought cake,
      and I&rsquo;m a lost woman. Little I dreamed when I had him in my arms a baby
      that I should some day be marrying him out of my own house! I little
      dreamed that! Oh, why did he come to me! Don&rsquo;t you remember his old nurse,
      when he was a baby in arms, that went away so sudden, and no fault of
      hers, Mr. Harley! The very mornin&rsquo; after the night you got into Mr.
      Benson&rsquo;s cellar, and got so tipsy on his Madeary&mdash;I remember it as
      clear as yesterday!&mdash;and Mr. Benson was that angry he threatened to
      use the whip to you, and I helped put you to bed. I&rsquo;m that very woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian smiled placidly at these reminiscences of his guileless youthful
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am! well?&rdquo; he said. He would bring her to the furnace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you see it all, kind sir?&rdquo; Mrs. Berry appealed to him in pathetic
      dumb show.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless by this time Adrian did see it all, and was mentally cursing at
      Folly, and reckoning the immediate consequences, but he looked
      uninstructed, his peculiar dimple-smile was undisturbed, his comfortable
      full-bodied posture was the same. &ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; he spurred her on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry burst forth: &ldquo;It were done this mornin&rsquo;, Mr. Harley, in the
      church, at half-past eleven of the clock, or twenty to, by licence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian was now obliged to comprehend a case of matrimony. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said,
      like one who is as hard as facts, and as little to be moved: &ldquo;Somebody was
      married this morning; was it Mr. Thompson, or Mr. Feverel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry shuffled up to Ripton, and removed the shawl from him, saying:
      &ldquo;Do he look like a new married bridegroom, Mr. Harley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian inspected the oblivious Ripton with philosophic gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This young gentleman was at church this morning?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! quite reasonable and proper then,&rdquo; Mrs. Berry begged him to
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; Adrian lifted and let fall the stupid inanimate limbs
      of the gone wretch, puckering his mouth queerly. &ldquo;You were all reasonable
      and proper, ma&rsquo;am. The principal male performer, then, is my cousin, Mr.
      Feverel? He was married by you, this morning, by licence at your parish
      church, and came here, and ate a hearty breakfast, and left intoxicated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry flew out. &ldquo;He never drink a drop, sir. A more moderate young
      gentleman you never see. Oh! don&rsquo;t ye think that now, Mr. Harley. He was
      as upright and master of his mind as you be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; the wise youth nodded thanks to her for the comparison, &ldquo;I mean the
      other form of intoxication.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry sighed. She could say nothing on that score.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian desired her to sit down, and compose herself, and tell him
      circumstantially what had been done.
    </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed, in utter perplexity at his perfectly composed demeanour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry, as her recital declared, was no other than that identical
      woman who once in old days had dared to behold the baronet behind his
      mask, and had ever since lived in exile from the Raynham world on a little
      pension regularly paid to her as an indemnity. She was that woman, and the
      thought of it made her almost accuse Providence for the betraying excess
      of softness it had endowed her with. How was she to recognize her baby
      grown a man? He came in a feigned name; not a word of the family was
      mentioned. He came like an ordinary mortal, though she felt something more
      than ordinary to him&mdash;she knew she did. He came bringing a beautiful
      young lady, and on what grounds could she turn her back on them? Why,
      seeing that all was chaste and legal, why should she interfere to make
      them unhappy&mdash;so few the chances of happiness in this world! Mrs.
      Berry related the seizure of her ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One wrench,&rdquo; said the sobbing culprit, &ldquo;one, and my ring was off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had no suspicions, and the task of writing her name in the vestry-book
      had been too enacting for a thought upon the other signatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay you were exceedingly sorry for what you had done,&rdquo; said Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, sir,&rdquo; moaned Berry, &ldquo;I were, and am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And would do your best to rectify the mischief&mdash;eh, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, and indeed, sir, I would,&rdquo; she protested solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;As, of course, you should&mdash;knowing the family. Where may
      these lunatics have gone to spend the Moon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry swimmingly replied: &ldquo;To the Isle&mdash;I don&rsquo;t quite know,
      sir!&rdquo; she snapped the indication short, and jumped out of the pit she had
      fallen into. Repentant as she might be, those dears should not be pursued
      and cruelly balked of their young bliss! &ldquo;To-morrow, if you please, Mr.
      Harley: not to-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pleasant spot,&rdquo; Adrian observed, smiling at his easy prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a measurement of dates he discovered that the bridegroom had brought
      his bride to the house on the day he had quitted Raynham, and this was
      enough to satisfy Adrian&rsquo;s mind that there had been concoction and
      chicanery. Chance, probably, had brought him to the old woman: chance
      certainly had not brought him to the young one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said, in answer to her petitions for his favourable
      offices with Sir Austin in behalf of her little pension and the bridal
      pair, &ldquo;I will tell him you were only a blind agent in the affair, being
      naturally soft, and that you trust he will bless the consummation. He will
      be in town to-morrow morning; but one of you two must see him to-night. An
      emetic kindly administered will set our friend here on his legs. A bath
      and a clean shirt, and he might go. I don&rsquo;t see why your name should
      appear at all. Brush him up, and send him to Bellingham by the seven
      o&rsquo;clock train. He will find his way to Raynham; he knows the neighbourhood
      best in the dark. Let him go and state the case. Remember, one of you must
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this fair prospect of leaving a choice of a perdition between the
      couple of unfortunates, for them to fight and lose all their virtues over,
      Adrian said, &ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry touchingly arrested him. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t refuse a piece of his cake,
      Mr. Harley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Adrian turned to the cake with alacrity. &ldquo;I shall
      claim a very large piece. Richard has a great many friends who will
      rejoice to eat his wedding-cake. Cut me a fair quarter, Mrs. Berry. Put it
      in paper, if you please. I shall be delighted to carry it to them, and
      apportion it equitably according to their several degrees of
      relationship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry cut the cake. Somehow, as she sliced through it, the sweetness
      and hapless innocence of the bride was presented to her, and she launched
      into eulogies of Lucy, and clearly showed how little she regretted her
      conduct. She vowed that they seemed made for each other; that both, were
      beautiful; both had spirit; both were innocent; and to part them, or make
      them unhappy, would be, Mrs. Berry wrought herself to cry aloud, oh, such
      a pity!
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian listened to it as the expression of a matter-of-fact opinion. He
      took the huge quarter of cake, nodded multitudinous promises, and left
      Mrs. Berry to bless his good heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So dies the System!&rdquo; was Adrian&rsquo;s comment in the street. &ldquo;And now let
      prophets roar! He dies respectably in a marriage-bed, which is more than I
      should have foretold of the monster. Meantime,&rdquo; he gave the cake a
      dramatic tap, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go sow nightmares.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Adrian really bore the news he had heard with creditable
      disinterestedness, and admirable repression of anything beneath the
      dignity of a philosopher. When one has attained that felicitous point of
      wisdom from which one sees all mankind to be fools, the diminutive objects
      may make what new moves they please, one does not marvel at them: their
      sedateness is as comical as their frolic, and their frenzies more comical
      still. On this intellectual eminence the wise youth had built his castle,
      and he had lived in it from an early period. Astonishment never shook the
      foundations, nor did envy of greater heights tempt him to relinquish the
      security of his stronghold, for he saw none. Jugglers he saw running up
      ladders that overtopped him, and air-balloons scaling the empyrean; but
      the former came precipitately down again, and the latter were at the mercy
      of the winds; while he remained tranquil on his solid unambitious ground,
      fitting his morality to the laws, his conscience to his morality, his
      comfort to his conscience. Not that voluntarily he cut himself off from
      his fellows: on the contrary, his sole amusement was their society. Alone
      he was rather dull, as a man who beholds but one thing must naturally be.
      Study of the animated varieties of that one thing excited him sufficiently
      to think life a pleasant play; and the faculties he had forfeited to hold
      his elevated position he could serenely enjoy by contemplation of them in
      others. Thus:&mdash;wonder at Master Richard&rsquo;s madness: though he himself
      did not experience it, he was eager to mark the effect on his beloved
      relatives. As he carried along his vindictive hunch of cake, he shaped out
      their different attitudes of amaze, bewilderment, horror; passing by some
      personal chagrin in the prospect. For his patron had projected a journey,
      commencing with Paris, culminating on the Alps, and lapsing in Rome: a
      delightful journey to show Richard the highways of History and tear him
      from the risk of further ignoble fascinations, that his spirit might be
      altogether bathed in freshness and revived. This had been planned during
      Richard&rsquo;s absence to surprise him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the dream of travel was to Adrian what the love of woman is to the
      race of young men. It supplanted that foolishness. It was his Romance, as
      we say; that buoyant anticipation on which in youth we ride the airs, and
      which, as we wax older and too heavy for our atmosphere, hardens to the
      Hobby, which, if an obstinate animal, is a safer horse, and conducts man
      at a slower pace to the sexton. Adrian had never travelled. He was aware
      that his romance was earthly and had discomforts only to be evaded by the
      one potent talisman possessed by his patron. His Alp would hardly be grand
      to him without an obsequious landlord in the foreground: he must recline
      on Mammon&rsquo;s imperial cushions in order to moralize becomingly on the
      ancient world. The search for pleasure at the expense of discomfort, as
      frantic lovers woo their mistresses to partake the shelter of a but and
      batten on a crust, Adrian deemed the bitterness of beggarliness. Let his
      sweet mistress be given him in the pomp and splendour due to his superior
      emotions, or not at all. Consequently the wise youth had long nursed an
      ineffectual passion, and it argued a great nature in him, that at the
      moment when his wishes were to be crowned, he should look with such slight
      touches of spleen at the gorgeous composite fabric of Parisian cookery and
      Roman antiquities crumbling into unsubstantial mockery. Assuredly very few
      even of the philosophers would have turned away uncomplainingly to meaner
      delights the moment after.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippias received the first portion of the cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sitting by the window in his hotel, reading. He had fought down his
      breakfast with more than usual success, and was looking forward to his
      dinner at the Foreys&rsquo; with less than usual timidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! glad you&rsquo;ve come, Adrian,&rdquo; he said, and expanded his chest. &ldquo;I was
      afraid I should have to ride down. This is kind of you. We&rsquo;ll walk down
      together through the park. It&rsquo;s absolutely dangerous to walk alone in
      these streets. My opinion is, that orange-peel lasts all through the year
      now, and will till legislation puts a stop to it. I give you my word I
      slipped on a piece of orange-peel yesterday afternoon in Piccadilly, and I
      thought I was down! I saved myself by a miracle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have an appetite, I hope?&rdquo; asked Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall get one, after a bit of a walk,&rdquo; chirped Hippias. &ldquo;Yes. I
      think I feel hungry now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charmed to hear it,&rdquo; said Adrian, and began unpinning his parcel on his
      knees. &ldquo;How should you define Folly?&rdquo; he checked the process to inquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; Hippias meditated; he prided himself on being oracular when such
      questions were addressed to him. &ldquo;I think I should define it to be a
      slide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good definition. In other words, a piece of orange-peel; once on it,
      your life and limbs are in danger, and you are saved by a miracle. You
      must present that to the Pilgrim. And the monument of folly, what would
      that be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hippias meditated anew. &ldquo;All the human race on one another&rsquo;s shoulders.&rdquo;
       He chuckled at the sweeping sourness of the instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; Adrian applauded, &ldquo;or in default of that, some symbol of the
      thing, say; such as this of which I have here brought you a chip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian displayed the quarter of the cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the monument made portable&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cake!&rdquo; cried Hippias, retreating to his chair to dramatize his intense
      disgust. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right of them that eat it. If I&mdash;if I don&rsquo;t
      mistake,&rdquo; he peered at it, &ldquo;the noxious composition bedizened in that way
      is what they call wedding-cake. It&rsquo;s arrant poison! Who is it you want to
      kill? What are you carrying such stuff about for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian rang the bell for a knife. &ldquo;To present you with your due and proper
      portion. You will have friends and relatives, and can&rsquo;t be saved from
      them, not even by miracle. It is a habit which exhibits, perhaps, the
      unconscious inherent cynicism of the human mind, for people who consider
      that they have reached the acme of mundane felicity, to distribute this
      token of esteem to their friends, with the object probably&rdquo; (he took the
      knife from a waiter and went to the table to slice the cake) &ldquo;of enabling
      those friends (these edifices require very delicate incision&mdash;each
      particular currant and subtle condiment hangs to its neighbour&mdash;a
      wedding-cake is evidently the most highly civilized of cakes, and partakes
      of the evils as well as the advantages of civilization!)&mdash;I was
      saying, they send us these love-tokens, no doubt (we shall have to weigh
      out the crumbs, if each is to have his fair share) that we may the better
      estimate their state of bliss by passing some hours in purgatory. This, as
      far as I can apportion it without weights and scales, is your share, my
      uncle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pushed the corner of the table bearing the cake towards Hippias.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get away!&rdquo; Hippias vehemently motioned, and started from his chair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      have none of it, I tell you! It&rsquo;s death! It&rsquo;s fifty times worse than that
      beastly compound Christmas pudding! What fool has been doing this, then?
      Who dares send me cake? Me! It&rsquo;s an insult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not compelled to eat any before dinner,&rdquo; said Adrian, pointing
      the corner of the table after him, &ldquo;but your share you must take, and
      appear to consume. One who has done so much to bring about the marriage
      cannot in conscience refuse his allotment of the fruits. Maidens, I hear,
      first cook it under their pillows, and extract nuptial dreams therefrom&mdash;said
      to be of a lighter class, taken that way. It&rsquo;s a capital cake, and, upon
      my honour, you have helped to make it&mdash;you have indeed! So here it
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The table again went at Hippias. He ran nimbly round it, and flung himself
      on a sofa exhausted, crying: &ldquo;There!... My appetite&rsquo;s gone for to-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then shall I tell Richard that you won&rsquo;t touch a morsel of his cake?&rdquo;
       said Adrian, leaning on his two hands over the table and looking at his
      uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your nephew: my cousin: Richard! Your companion since you&rsquo;ve been in
      town. He&rsquo;s married, you know. Married this morning at Kensington parish
      church, by licence, at half-past eleven of the clock, or twenty to.
      Married, and gone to spend his honeymoon in the Isle of Wight, a very
      delectable place for a month&rsquo;s residence. I have to announce to you that,
      thanks to your assistance, the experiment is launched, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard married!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something to think and to say in objection to it, but the wits
      of poor Hippias were softened by the shock. His hand travelled half-way to
      his forehead, spread out to smooth the surface of that seat of reason, and
      then fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you knew all about it? you were so anxious to have him in town
      under your charge....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married?&rdquo; Hippias jumped up&mdash;he had it. &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s under age! he&rsquo;s
      an infant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is. But the infant is not the less married. Fib like a man and pay
      your fee&mdash;what does it matter? Any one who is breeched can obtain a
      licence in our noble country. And the interests of morality demand that it
      should not be difficult. Is it true&mdash;can you persuade anybody that
      you have known nothing about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! infamous joke! I wish, sir, you would play your pranks on somebody
      else,&rdquo; said Hippias, sternly, as he sank back on the sofa. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done me
      up for the day, I can assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian sat down to instil belief by gentle degrees, and put an artistic
      finish to the work. He had the gratification of passing his uncle through
      varied contortions, and at last Hippias perspired in conviction, and
      exclaimed, &ldquo;This accounts for his conduct to me. That boy must have a
      cunning nothing short of infernal! I feel...I feel it just here, he drew a
      hand along his midriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not equal to this world of fools,&rdquo; he added faintly, and shut his
      eyes. &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t dine. Eat? ha!... no. Go without me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after, Hippias went to bed, saying to himself, as he undressed,
      &ldquo;See what comes of our fine schemes! Poor Austin!&rdquo; and as the pillow
      swelled over his ears, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that a day&rsquo;s fast won&rsquo;t do me good.&rdquo;
       The Dyspepsy had bought his philosophy at a heavy price; he had a right to
      use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian resumed the procession of the cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighted his melancholy uncle Algernon hunting an appetite in the Row,
      and looking as if the hope ahead of him were also one-legged. The Captain
      did not pass with out querying the ungainly parcel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I carry it ostentatiously enough?&rdquo; said Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enclosed is wherewithal to quiet the alarm of the land. Now may the maids
      and wives of Merry England sleep secure. I had half a mind to fix it on a
      pole, and engage a band to parade it. This is our dear Richard&rsquo;s
      wedding-cake. Married at half-past eleven this morning, by licence, at the
      Kensington parish church; his own ring being lost he employed the ring of
      his beautiful bride&rsquo;s lachrymose land-lady, she standing adjacent by the
      altar. His farewell to you as a bachelor, and hers as a maid, you can
      claim on the spot if you think proper, and digest according to your
      powers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Algernon let off steam in a whistle. &ldquo;Thompson, the solicitor&rsquo;s daughter!&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;I met them the other day, somewhere about here. He introduced me
      to her. A pretty little baggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Adrian set him right. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a Miss Desborough, a Roman Catholic
      dairymaid. Reminds one of pastoral England in the time of the
      Plantagenets! He&rsquo;s quite equal to introducing her as Thompson&rsquo;s daughter,
      and himself as Beelzebub&rsquo;s son. However, the wild animal is in Hymen&rsquo;s
      chains, and the cake is cut. Will you have your morsel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by all means!&mdash;not now.&rdquo; Algernon had an unwonted air of
      reflection.&mdash;&ldquo;Father know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. He will to-night by nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I must see him by seven. Don&rsquo;t say you met me.&rdquo; He nodded, and
      pricked his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wants money!&rdquo; said Adrian, putting the combustible he carried once more
      in motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The women were the crowning joy of his contemplative mind. He had reserved
      them for his final discharge. Dear demonstrative creatures! Dyspepsia
      would not weaken their poignant outcries, or self-interest check their
      fainting fits. On the generic woman one could calculate. Well might The
      Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip say of her that, &ldquo;She is always at Nature&rsquo;s breast&rdquo;; not
      intending it as a compliment. Each woman is Eve throughout the ages;
      whereas the Pilgrim would have us believe that the Adam in men has become
      warier, if not wiser; and weak as he is, has learnt a lesson from time.
      Probably the Pilgrim&rsquo;s meaning may be taken to be, that Man grows, and
      Woman does not.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, Adrian hoped for such natural choruses as you hear in the
      nursery when a bauble is lost. He was awake to Mrs. Doria&rsquo;s maternal
      predestinations, and guessed that Clare stood ready with the best form of
      filial obedience. They were only a poor couple to gratify his
      Mephistophelian humour, to be sure, but Mrs. Doria was equal to twenty,
      and they would proclaim the diverse ways with which maidenhood and
      womanhood took disappointment, while the surrounding Forey girls and other
      females of the family assembly were expected to develop the finer shades
      and tapering edges of an agitation to which no woman could be cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      All went well. He managed cleverly to leave the cake unchallenged in a
      conspicuous part of the drawing-room, and stepped gaily down to dinner.
      Much of the conversation adverted to Richard. Mrs. Doria asked him if he
      had seen the youth, or heard of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seen him? no! Heard of him? yes!&rdquo; said Adrian. &ldquo;I have heard of him. I
      heard that he was sublimely happy, and had eaten such a breakfast that
      dinner was impossible; claret and cold chicken, cake and&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cake at breakfast!&rdquo; they all interjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That seems to be his fancy just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an extraordinary taste!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, he is educated on a System.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One fast young male Forey allied the System and the cake in a miserable
      pun. Adrian, a hater of puns, looked at him, and held the table silent, as
      if he were going to speak; but he said nothing, and the young gentleman
      vanished from the conversation in a blush, extinguished by his own spark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doria peevishly exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh! fish-cake, I suppose! I wish he
      understood a little better the obligations of relationship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether he understands them, I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; observed Adrian, &ldquo;but I assure
      you he is very energetic in extending them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wise youth talked innuendoes whenever he had an opportunity, that his
      dear relative might be rendered sufficiently inflammable by and by at the
      aspect of the cake; but he was not thought more than commonly mysterious
      and deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was his appointment at the house of those Grandison people?&rdquo; Mrs. Doria
      asked, with a hostile upper-lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian warmed the blindfolded parties by replying, &ldquo;Do they keep a beadle
      at the door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doria&rsquo;s animosity to Mrs. Grandison made her treat this as a piece of
      satirical ingenuousness. &ldquo;I daresay they do,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a curate on hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I should think a dozen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mr. Forey advised his punning grandson Clarence to give that house a
      wide berth, where he might be disposed of and dished-up at a moment&rsquo;s
      notice, and the scent ran off at a jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Foreys gave good dinners, and with the old gentleman the excellent old
      fashion remained in permanence of trooping off the ladies as soon as they
      had taken their sustenance and just exchanged a smile with the flowers and
      the dessert, when they rose to fade with a beautiful accord, and the
      gallant males breathed under easier waistcoats, and settled to the
      business of the table, sure that an hour for unbosoming and imbibing was
      their own. Adrian took a chair by Brandon Forey, a barrister of standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to ask you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whether an infant in law can legally bind
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s old enough to affix his signature to an instrument, I suppose he
      can,&rdquo; yawned Brandon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he responsible for his acts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt we could hang him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what he could do for himself, you could do for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite so much; pretty near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For instance, he can marry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a criminal case, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the marriage is valid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can dispute it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and the Greeks and the Trojans can fight. It holds then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both water and fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The patriarch of the table sang out to Adrian that he stopped the vigorous
      circulation of the claret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, sir!&rdquo; said Adrian, &ldquo;I beg pardon. The circumstances must excuse
      me. The fact is, my cousin Richard got married to a dairymaid this
      morning, and I wanted to know whether it held in law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was amusing to watch the manly coolness with which the announcement was
      taken. Nothing was heard more energetic than, &ldquo;Deuce he has!&rdquo; and, &ldquo;A
      dairymaid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it better to let the ladies dine in peace,&rdquo; Adrian continued.
      &ldquo;I wanted to be able to console my aunt&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but&mdash;well, but,&rdquo; the old gentleman, much the most excited,
      puffed&mdash;&ldquo;eh, Brandon? He&rsquo;s a boy, this young ass! Do you mean to tell
      me a boy can go and marry when he pleases, and any troll he pleases, and
      the marriage is good? If I thought that I&rsquo;d turn every woman off my
      premises. I would! from the housekeeper to the scullery-maid. I&rsquo;d have no
      woman near him till&mdash;till&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till the young greenhorn was grey, sir?&rdquo; suggested Brandon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till he knew what women are made of, sir!&rdquo; the old gentleman finished his
      sentence vehemently. &ldquo;What, d&rsquo;ye think, will Feverel say to it, Mr.
      Adrian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been trying the very System you have proposed sir&mdash;one that
      does not reckon on the powerful action of curiosity on the juvenile
      intelligence. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s the very worst way of solving the problem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; said Clarence. &ldquo;None but a fool!&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your age,&rdquo; Adrian relieved his embarrassment, &ldquo;it is natural, my dear
      Clarence, that you should consider the idea of an isolated or imprisoned
      manhood something monstrous, and we do not expect you to see what amount
      of wisdom it contains. You follow one extreme, and we the other. I don&rsquo;t
      say that a middle course exists. The history of mankind shows our painful
      efforts to find one, but they have invariably resolved themselves into
      asceticism, or laxity, acting and reacting. The moral question is, if a
      naughty little man, by reason of his naughtiness, releases himself from
      foolishness, does a foolish little man, by reason of his foolishness, save
      himself from naughtiness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A discussion, peculiar to men of the world, succeeded the laugh at Mr.
      Clarence. Then coffee was handed round and the footman informed Adrian, in
      a low voice, that Mrs. Doria Forey particularly wished to speak with him.
      Adrian preferred not to go in alone. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, and sipped his
      coffee. They talked on, sounding the depths of law in Brandon Forey, and
      receiving nought but hollow echoes from that profound cavity. He would not
      affirm that the marriage was invalid: he would not affirm that it could
      not be annulled. He thought not: still he thought it would be worth
      trying. A consummated and a non-consummated union were two different
      things....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Adrian, &ldquo;does the Law recognize that? Why, that&rsquo;s almost
      human!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another message was brought to Adrian that Mrs. Doria Forey very
      particularly wished to speak with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can be the matter?&rdquo; he exclaimed, pleased to have his faith in woman
      strengthened. The cake had exploded, no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it proved, when the gentlemen joined the fair society. All the younger
      ladies stood about the table, whereon the cake stood displayed, gaps being
      left for those sitting to feast their vision, and intrude the comments and
      speculations continually arising from fresh shocks of wonder at the
      unaccountable apparition. Entering with the half-guilty air of men who
      know they have come from a grosser atmosphere, the gallant males also
      ranged themselves round the common object of curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here! Adrian!&rdquo; Mrs. Doria cried. &ldquo;Where is Adrian? Pray, come here. Tell
      me! Where did this cake come from? Whose is it? What does it do here? You
      know all about it, for you brought it. Clare saw you bring it into the
      room. What does it mean? I insist upon a direct answer. Now do not make me
      impatient, Adrian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Certainly Mrs. Doria was equal to twenty. By her concentrated rapidity and
      volcanic complexion it was evident that suspicion had kindled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was really bound to bring it,&rdquo; Adrian protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wise youth bowed: &ldquo;Categorically. This cake came from the house of a
      person, a female, of the name of Berry. It belongs to you partly, partly
      to me, partly to Clare, and to the rest of our family, on the principle of
      equal division for which purpose it is present....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means, my dear aunt, what that kind of cake usually does mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, then, is the Breakfast! And the ring! Adrian! where is Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doria still clung to unbelief in the monstrous horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Adrian told her that Richard had left town, her struggling hope
      sank. &ldquo;The wretched boy has ruined himself!&rdquo; she said, and sat down
      trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! that System! The delicate vituperations gentle ladies use instead of
      oaths, Mrs. Doria showered on that System. She hesitated not to say that
      her brother had got what he deserved. Opinionated, morbid, weak, justice
      had overtaken him. Now he would see! but at what a price! at what a
      sacrifice!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doria, commanded Adrian to confirm her fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sadly the wise youth recapitulated Berry&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;He was married this
      morning at half-past eleven of the clock, or twenty to twelve, by licence,
      at the Kensington parish church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that was his appointment!&rdquo; Mrs. Doria murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the cake for breakfast!&rdquo; breathed a second of her sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it was his ring!&rdquo; exclaimed a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men were silent, and made long faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare stood cold and sedate. She and her mother avoided each other&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it that abominable country person, Adrian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The happy damsel is, I regret to say, the Papist dairymaid,&rdquo; said Adrian,
      in sorrowful but deliberate accents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then arose a feminine hum, in the midst of which Mrs. Doria cried,
      &ldquo;Brandon!&rdquo; She was a woman of energy. Her thoughts resolved to action
      spontaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brandon,&rdquo; she drew the barrister a little aside, &ldquo;can they not be
      followed, and separated? I want your advice. Cannot we separate them? A
      boy! it is really shameful if he should be allowed to fall into the toils
      of a designing creature to ruin himself irrevocably. Can we not, Brandon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The worthy barrister felt inclined to laugh, but he answered her
      entreaties: &ldquo;From what I hear of the young groom I should imagine the
      office perilous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m speaking of law, Brandon. Can we not obtain an order from one of your
      Courts to pursue them and separate them instantly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brandon was sorry to say she decidedly could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might call on one of your Judges, Brandon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brandon assured her that the Judges were a hard-worked race, and to a man
      slept heavily after dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you do so to-morrow, the first thing in the morning? Will you
      promise me to do so, Brandon?&mdash;Or a magistrate! A magistrate would
      send a policeman after them. My dear Brandon! I beg&mdash;I beg you to
      assist us in this dreadful extremity. It will be the death of my poor
      brother. I believe he would forgive anything but this. You have no idea
      what his notions are of blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brandon tipped Adrian a significant nod to step in and aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, aunt?&rdquo; asked the wise youth. &ldquo;You want them followed and torn
      asunder by wild policemen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo; Brandon queerly interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t that be&mdash;just too late?&rdquo; Adrian suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doria, sighed out her last spark of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Adrian....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! yes!&rdquo; Mrs. Doria did not require any of his elucidations. &ldquo;Pray be
      quiet, Adrian, and let me speak. Brandon! it cannot be! it&rsquo;s quite
      impossible! Can you stand there and tell me that boy is legally married? I
      never will believe it! The law cannot be so shamefully bad as to permit a
      boy&mdash;a mere child&mdash;to do such absurd things. Grandpapa!&rdquo; she
      beckoned to the old gentleman. &ldquo;Grandpapa! pray do make Brandon speak.
      These lawyers never will. He might stop it, if he would. If I were a man,
      do you think I would stand here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; the old gentleman toddled to compose her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite of
      your opinion. I believe he knows no more than you or I. My belief is they
      none of them know anything till they join issue and go into Court. I want
      to see a few female lawyers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To encourage the bankrupt perruquier, sir?&rdquo; said Adrian. &ldquo;They would have
      to keep a large supply of wigs on hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you can jest, Adrian!&rdquo; his aunt reproached him. &ldquo;But I will not be
      beaten. I know&mdash;I am firmly convinced that no law would ever allow a
      boy to disgrace his family and ruin himself like that, and nothing shall
      persuade me that it is so. Now, tell me, Brandon, and pray do speak in
      answer to my questions, and please to forget you are dealing with a woman.
      Can my nephew be rescued from the consequences of his folly? Is what he
      has done legitimate? Is he bound for life by what he has done while a boy?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;a,&rdquo; Brandon breathed through his teeth. &ldquo;A&mdash;hm! the
      matter&rsquo;s so very delicate, you see, Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re to forget that,&rdquo; Adrian remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;hm! well!&rdquo; pursued Brandon. &ldquo;Perhaps if you could arrest and
      divide them before nightfall, and make affidavit of certain facts&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; the eager woman hastened his lagging mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well...hm! a...in that case...a... Or if a lunatic, you could prove him
      to have been of unsound mind.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! there&rsquo;s no doubt of his madness on my mind, Brandon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! well! in that case... Or if of different religious persuasions&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a Catholic!&rdquo; Mrs. Doria joyfully interjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! well! in that case...objections might be taken to the form of the
      marriage... Might be proved fictitious... Or if he&rsquo;s under, say, eighteen
      years&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t be much more,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Doria. &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she appeared to
      reflect, and then faltered imploringly to Adrian, &ldquo;What is Richard&rsquo;s age?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The kind wise youth could not find it in his heart to strike away the
      phantom straw she caught at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! about that, I should fancy,&rdquo; he muttered; and found it necessary at
      the same time to duck and turn his head for concealment. Mrs. Doria
      surpassed his expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes I well, then...&rdquo; Brandon was resuming with a shrug, which was meant
      to say he still pledged himself to nothing, when Clare&rsquo;s voice was heard
      from out the buzzing circle of her cousins: &ldquo;Richard is nineteen years and
      six months old to-day, mama.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is, mama.&rdquo; Clare&rsquo;s voice was very steadfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, I tell you. How can you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard is one year and nine months older than me, mama.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doria fought the fact by years and finally by months. Clare was too
      strong for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Singular child!&rdquo; she mentally apostrophized the girl who scornfully
      rejected straws while drowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s the religion still!&rdquo; she comforted herself, and sat down to
      cogitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men smiled and looked vacuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Music was proposed. There are times when soft music hath not charms; when
      it is put to as base uses as Imperial Caesar&rsquo;s dust and is taken to fill
      horrid pauses. Angelica Forey thumped the piano, and sang: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a laughing
      Gitana, ha-ha! ha-ha!&rdquo; Matilda Forey and her cousin Mary Branksburne
      wedded their voices, and songfully incited all young people to Haste to
      the bower that love has built, and defy the wise ones of the world; but
      the wise ones of the world were in a majority there, and very few places
      of assembly will be found where they are not; so the glowing appeal of the
      British ballad-monger passed into the bosom of the emptiness he addressed.
      Clare was asked to entertain the company. The singular child calmly
      marched to the instrument, and turned over the appropriate illustrations
      to the ballad-monger&rsquo;s repertory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare sang a little Irish air. Her duty done, she marched from the piano.
      Mothers are rarely deceived by their daughters in these matters; but Clare
      deceived her mother; and Mrs. Doria only persisted in feeling an agony of
      pity for her child, that she might the more warrantably pity herself&mdash;a
      not uncommon form of the emotion, for there is no juggler like that heart
      the ballad-monger puts into our mouths so boldly. Remember that she saw
      years of self-denial, years of a ripening scheme, rendered fruitless in a
      minute, and by the System which had almost reduced her to the condition of
      constitutional hypocrite. She had enough of bitterness to brood over, and
      some excuse for self-pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, even when she was cooler, Mrs. Doria&rsquo;s energetic nature prevented
      her from giving up. Straws were straws, and the frailer they were the
      harder she clutched them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose from her chair, and left the room, calling to Adrian to follow
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adrian,&rdquo; she said, turning upon him in the passage, &ldquo;you mentioned a
      house where this horrible cake...where he was this morning. I desire you
      to take me to that woman immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wise youth had not bargained for personal servitude. He had hoped he
      should be in time for the last act of the opera that night, after enjoying
      the comedy of real life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear aunt&rdquo;...he was beginning to insinuate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order a cab to be sent for, and get your hat,&rdquo; said Mrs. Doria.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing for it but to obey. He stamped his assent to the
      Pilgrim&rsquo;s dictum, that Women are practical creatures, and now reflected on
      his own account, that relationship to a young fool may be a vexation and a
      nuisance. However, Mrs. Doria compensated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Mrs. Doria intended to do, the practical creature did not plainly
      know; but her energy positively demanded to be used in some way or other,
      and her instinct directed her to the offender on whom she could use it in
      wrath. She wanted somebody to be angry with, somebody to abuse. She dared
      not abuse her brother to his face: him she would have to console. Adrian
      was a fellow-hypocrite to the System, and would, she was aware, bring her
      into painfully delicate, albeit highly philosophic, ground by a discussion
      of the case. So she drove to Bessy Berry simply to inquire whither her
      nephew had flown.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a soft woman, and that soft woman a sinner, is matched with a woman
      of energy, she does not show much fight, and she meets no mercy. Bessy
      Berry&rsquo;s creditor came to her in female form that night. She then beheld it
      in all its terrors. Hitherto it had appeared to her as a male, a
      disembodied spirit of her imagination possessing male attributes, and the
      peculiar male characteristic of being moved, and ultimately silenced, by
      tears. As female, her creditor was terrible indeed. Still, had it not been
      a late hour, Bessy Berry would have died rather than speak openly that her
      babes had sped to make their nest in the Isle of Wight. They had a long
      start, they were out of the reach of pursuers, they were safe, and she
      told what she had to tell. She told more than was wise of her to tell. She
      made mention of her early service in the family, and of her little
      pension. Alas! her little pension! Her creditor had come expecting no
      payment&mdash;come; as creditors are wont in such moods, just to take it
      out of her&mdash;to employ the familiar term. At once Mrs. Doria pounced
      upon the pension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, of course, you know is at an end,&rdquo; she said in the calmest manner,
      and Berry did not plead for the little bit of bread to her. She only asked
      a little consideration for her feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      True admirers of women had better stand aside from the scene. Undoubtedly
      it was very sad for Adrian to be compelled to witness it. Mrs. Doria was
      not generous. The Pilgrim may be wrong about the sex not growing; but its
      fashion of conducting warfare we must allow to be barbarous, and according
      to what is deemed the pristine, or wild cat, method. Ruin, nothing short
      of it, accompanied poor Berry to her bed that night, and her character
      bled till morning on her pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene over, Adrian reconducted Mrs. Doria to her home. Mice had been
      at the cake during her absence apparently. The ladies and gentlemen
      present put it on the greedy mice, who were accused of having gorged and
      gone to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re quite welcome,&rdquo; said Mrs. Doria. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a farce, this
      marriage, and Adrian has quite come to my way of thinking. I would not
      touch an atom of it. Why, they were married in a married woman&rsquo;s ring! Can
      that be legal, as you call it? Oh, I&rsquo;m convinced! Don&rsquo;t tell me. Austin
      will be in town to-morrow, and if he is true to his principles, he will
      instantly adopt measures to rescue his son from infamy. I want no legal
      advice. I go upon common sense, common decency. This marriage is false.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doria&rsquo;s fine scheme had become so much a part of her life, that she
      could not give it up. She took Clare to her bed, and caressed and wept
      over her, as she would not have done had she known the singular child,
      saying, &ldquo;Poor Richard! my dear poor boy! we must save him, Clare! we must
      save him!&rdquo; Of the two the mother showed the greater want of iron on this
      occasion. Clare lay in her arms rigid and emotionless, with one of her
      hands tight-locked. All she said was: &ldquo;I knew it in the morning, mama.&rdquo;
       She slept clasping Richard&rsquo;s nuptial ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time all specially concerned in the System knew it. The honeymoon
      was shoring placidly above them. Is not happiness like another circulating
      medium? When we have a very great deal of it, some poor hearts are aching
      for what is taken away from them. When we have gone out and seized it on
      the highways, certain inscrutable laws are sure to be at work to bring us
      to the criminal bar, sooner or later. Who knows the honeymoon that did not
      steal somebody&rsquo;s sweetness? Richard Turpin went forth, singing &ldquo;Money or
      life&rdquo; to the world: Richard Feverel has done the same, substituting
      &ldquo;Happiness&rdquo; for &ldquo;Money,&rdquo; frequently synonyms. The coin he wanted he would
      have, and was just as much a highway robber as his fellow Dick, so that
      those who have failed to recognize him as a hero before, may now regard
      him in that light. Meanwhile the world he has squeezed looks exceedingly
      patient and beautiful. His coin chinks delicious music to him. Nature and
      the order of things on earth have no warmer admirer than a jolly brigand
      or a young man made happy by the Jews.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      And now the author of the System was on trial under the eyes of the lady
      who loved him. What so kind as they? Yet are they very rigorous, those
      soft watchful woman&rsquo;s eyes. If you are below the measure they have made of
      you, you will feel it in the fulness of time. She cannot but show you that
      she took you for a giant, and has had to come down a bit. You feel
      yourself strangely diminishing in those sweet mirrors, till at last they
      drop on you complacently level. But, oh beware, vain man, of ever waxing
      enamoured of that wonderful elongation of a male creature you saw
      reflected in her adoring upcast orbs! Beware of assisting to delude her! A
      woman who is not quite a fool will forgive your being but a man, if you
      are surely that: she will haply learn to acknowledge that no mortal tailor
      could have fitted that figure she made of you respectably, and that
      practically (though she sighs to think it) her ideal of you was on the
      pattern of an overgrown charity-boy in the regulation jacket and breech.
      For this she first scorns the narrow capacities of the tailor, and then
      smiles at herself. But shouldst thou, when the hour says plainly, Be
      thyself, and the woman is willing to take thee as thou art, shouldst thou
      still aspire to be that thing of shanks and wrests, wilt thou not seem
      contemptible as well as ridiculous? And when the fall comes, will it not
      be flat on thy face, instead of to the common height of men? You may fall
      miles below her measure of you, and be safe: nothing is damaged save an
      overgrown charity-boy; but if you fall below the common height of men, you
      must make up your mind to see her rustle her gown, spy at the
      looking-glass, and transfer her allegiance. The moral of which is, that if
      we pretend to be what we are not, woman, for whose amusement the farce is
      performed, will find us out and punish us for it. And it is usually the
      end of a sentimental dalliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Sir Austin given vent to the pain and wrath it was natural he should
      feel, he might have gone to unphilosophic excesses, and, however much he
      lowered his reputation as a sage, Lady Blandish would have excused him:
      she would not have loved him less for seeing him closer. But the poor
      gentleman tasked his soul and stretched his muscles to act up to her
      conception of him. He, a man of science in life, who was bound to be
      surprised by nothing in nature, it was not for him to do more than lift
      his eyebrows and draw in his lips at the news delivered by Ripton
      Thompson, that ill bird at Raynham.
    </p>
    <p>
      All he said, after Ripton had handed the letters and carried his
      penitential headache to bed, was: &ldquo;You see, Emmeline, it is useless to
      base any system on a human being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A very philosophical remark for one who has been busily at work building
      for nearly twenty years. Too philosophical to seem genuine. It revealed
      where the blow struck sharpest. Richard was no longer the Richard of his
      creation&mdash;his pride and his joy&mdash;but simply a human being with
      the rest. The bright star had sunk among the mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, what had the young man done? And in what had the System failed?
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady could not but ask herself this, while she condoled with the
      offended father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; she said, tenderly taking his hand before she retired, &ldquo;I
      know how deeply you must be grieved. I know what your disappointment must
      be. I do not beg of you to forgive him now. You cannot doubt his love for
      this young person, and according to his light, has he not behaved
      honourably, and as you would have wished, rather than bring her to shame?
      You will think of that. It has been an accident&mdash;a misfortune&mdash;a
      terrible misfortune&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The God of this world is in the machine&mdash;not out of it,&rdquo; Sir Austin
      interrupted her, and pressed her hand to get the good-night over.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any other time her mind would have been arrested to admire the phrase;
      now it seemed perverse, vain, false, and she was tempted to turn the
      meaning that was in it against himself, much as she pitied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, Emmeline,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I believe very little in the fortune, or
      misfortune, to which men attribute their successes and reverses. They are
      useful impersonations to novelists; but my opinion is sufficiently high of
      flesh and blood to believe that we make our own history without
      intervention. Accidents?&mdash;Terrible misfortunes?&mdash;What are they?&mdash;Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; she said, looking sad and troubled. &ldquo;When I said,
      &lsquo;misfortune,&rsquo; I meant, of course, that he is to blame; but&mdash;shall I
      leave you his letter to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have enough to meditate upon,&rdquo; he replied, coldly bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;And&mdash;may I say it? do not shut your
      heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He assured her that he hoped not to do so and the moment she was gone he
      set about shutting it as tight as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, instead of saying, Base no system on a human being, he had said, Never
      experimentalize with one, he would have been nearer the truth of his own
      case. He had experimented on humanity in the person of the son he loved as
      his life, and at once, when the experiment appeared to have failed, all
      humanity&rsquo;s failings fell on the shoulders of his son. Richard&rsquo;s parting
      laugh in the train&mdash;it was explicable now: it sounded in his ears
      like the mockery of this base nature of ours at every endeavour to exalt
      and chasten it. The young man had plotted this. From step to step Sir
      Austin traced the plot. The curious mask he had worn since his illness;
      the selection of his incapable uncle Hippias for a companion in preference
      to Adrian; it was an evident, well-perfected plot. That hideous laugh
      would not be silenced: Base, like the rest, treacherous, a creature of
      passions using his abilities solely to gratify them&mdash;never surely had
      humanity such chances as in him! A Manichaean tendency, from which the
      sententious eulogist of nature had been struggling for years (and which
      was partly at the bottom of the System), now began to cloud and usurp
      dominion of his mind. As he sat alone in the forlorn dead-hush of his
      library, he saw the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      How are we to know when we are at the head and fountain of the fates of
      them we love?
    </p>
    <p>
      There by the springs of Richard&rsquo;s future, his father sat: and the devil
      said to him: &ldquo;Only be quiet: do nothing: resolutely do nothing: your
      object now is to keep a brave face to the world, so that all may know you
      superior to this human nature that has deceived you. For it is the
      shameless deception, not the marriage, that has wounded you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; answered the baronet, &ldquo;the shameless deception, not the marriage:
      wicked and ruinous as it must be; a destroyer of my tenderest hopes! my
      dearest schemes! Not the marriage&mdash;the shameless deception!&rdquo; and he
      crumpled up his son&rsquo;s letter to him, and tossed it into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      How are we to distinguish the dark chief of the Manichaeans when he talks
      our own thoughts to us?
    </p>
    <p>
      Further he whispered, &ldquo;And your System:&mdash;if you would be brave to the
      world, have courage to cast the dream of it out of you: relinquish an
      impossible project; see it as it is&mdash;dead: too good for men!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; muttered the baronet: &ldquo;all who would save them perish on the Cross!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so he sat nursing the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by he took his lamp, and put on the old cloak and cap, and went to
      gaze at Ripton. That exhausted debauchee and youth without a destiny slept
      a dead sleep. A handkerchief was bound about his forehead, and his
      helpless sunken chin and snoring nose projected up the pillow, made him
      look absurdly piteous. The baronet remembered how often he had compared
      his boy with this one: his own bright boy! And where was the difference
      between them?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mere outward gilding!&rdquo; said his familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he responded, &ldquo;I daresay this one never positively plotted to
      deceive his father: he followed his appetites unchecked, and is internally
      the sounder of the two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton, with his sunken chin and snoring nose under the light of the lamp,
      stood for human nature, honest, however abject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Random, I fear very much, is a necessary establishment!&rdquo; whispered
      the monitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the evil in us demand its natural food, or it corrupts the whole?&rdquo;
       ejaculated Sir Austin. &ldquo;And is no angel of avail till that is drawn off?
      And is that our conflict&mdash;to see whether we can escape the contagion
      of its embrace, and come uncorrupted out of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world is wise in its way,&rdquo; said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though it look on itself through Port wine?&rdquo; he suggested, remembering
      his lawyer Thompson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wise in not seeking to be too wise,&rdquo; said the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And getting intoxicated on its drug of comfort!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Human nature is weak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Miss Random is an establishment, and Wild Oats an institution!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It always has been so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And always will be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I fear! in spite of your very noble efforts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And leads&mdash;whither? And ends&mdash;where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard&rsquo;s laugh, taken up by horrid reverberations, as it were through the
      lengths of the Lower Halls, replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      This colloquy of two voices in a brain was concluded by Sir Austin asking
      again if there were no actual difference between the flower of his hopes
      and yonder drunken weed, and receiving for answer that there was a decided
      dissimilarity in the smell of the couple; becoming cognizant of which he
      retreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin did not battle with the tempter. He took him into his bosom at
      once, as if he had been ripe for him, and received his suggestions and
      bowed to his dictates. Because he suffered, and decreed that he would
      suffer silently, and be the only sufferer, it seemed to him that he was
      great-minded in his calamity. He had stood against the world. The world
      had beaten him. What then? He must shut his heart and mask his face; that
      was all. To be far in advance of the mass, is as fruitless to mankind, he
      reflected, as straggling in the rear. For how do we know that they move
      behind us at all, or move in our track? What we win for them is lost; and
      where we are overthrown we lie!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was thus that a fine mind and a fine heart at the bounds of a nature
      not great, chose to colour his retrogression and countenance his
      shortcoming; and it was thus that he set about ruining the work he had
      done. He might well say, as he once did, that there are hours when the
      clearest soul becomes a cunning fox. For a grief that was private and
      peculiar, he unhesitatingly cast the blame upon humanity; just as he had
      accused it in the period of what he termed his own ordeal. How had he
      borne that? By masking his face. And he prepared the ordeal for his son by
      doing the same. This was by no means his idea of a man&rsquo;s duty in
      tribulation, about which he could be strenuously eloquent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was his instinct so to act, and in times of trial great natures
      alone are not at the mercy of their instincts. Moreover it would cost him
      pain to mask his face; pain worse than that he endured when there still
      remained an object for him to open his heart to in proportion; and he
      always reposed upon the Spartan comfort of bearing pain and being passive.
      &ldquo;Do nothing,&rdquo; said the devil he nursed; which meant in his case, &ldquo;Take me
      into you and don&rsquo;t cast me out.&rdquo; Excellent and sane is the outburst of
      wrath to men, when it stops short of slaughter. For who that locks it up
      to eat in solitary, can say that it is consumed? Sir Austin had as weak a
      digestion for wrath, as poor Hippias for a green duckling. Instead of
      eating it, it ate him. The wild beast in him was not the less deadly
      because it did not roar, and the devil in him not the less active because
      he resolved to do nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat at the springs of Richard&rsquo;s future, in the forlorn dead-hush of his
      library there, hearing the cinders click in the extinguished fire, and
      that humming stillness in which one may fancy one hears the midnight Fates
      busily stirring their embryos. The lamp glowed mildly on the bust of
      Chatham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward morning a gentle knock fell at his door. Lady Blandish glided in.
      With hasty step she came straight to him, and took both his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; she said, speaking tearfully, and trembling, &ldquo;I feared I
      should find you here. I could not sleep. How is it with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! Emmeline, well!&rdquo; he replied, torturing his brows to fix the mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wished it had been Adrian who had come to him. He had an extraordinary
      longing for Adrian&rsquo;s society. He knew that the wise youth would divine how
      to treat him, and he mentally confessed to just enough weakness to demand
      a certain kind of management. Besides, Adrian, he had not a doubt, would
      accept him entirely as he seemed, and not pester him in any way by trying
      to unlock his heart; whereas a woman, he feared, would be waxing too
      womanly, and swelling from tears and supplications to a scene, of all
      things abhorred by him the most. So he rapped the floor with his foot, and
      gave the lady no very welcome face when he said it was well with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down by his side, still holding one hand firmly, and softly
      detaining the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my friend! may I believe you? May I speak to you?&rdquo; She leaned close
      to him. &ldquo;You know my heart. I have no better ambition than to be your
      friend. Surely I divide your grief, and may I not claim your confidence?
      Who has wept more over your great and dreadful sorrows? I would not have
      come to you, but I do believe that sorrow shared relieves the burden, and
      it is now that you may feel a woman&rsquo;s aid, and something of what a woman
      could be to you....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be assured,&rdquo; he gravely said, &ldquo;I thank you, Emmeline, for your
      intentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! not for my intentions! And do not thank me. Think of him...think
      of your dear boy... Our Richard, as we have called him.&mdash;Oh! do not
      think it a foolish superstition of mine, but I have had a thought this
      night that has kept me in torment till I rose to speak to you... Tell me
      first you have forgiven him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A father bears no malice to his son, Emmeline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your heart has forgiven him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heart has taken what he gave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And quite forgiven him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will hear no complaints of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady paused despondingly, and looked at him in a wistful manner,
      saying with a sigh, &ldquo;Yes! I know how noble you are, and different from
      others!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew one of his hands from her relaxed hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to be in bed, Emmeline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, and talk to me another time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it must be now. You have helped me when I struggled to rise into a
      clearer world, and I think, humble as I am, I can help you now. I have had
      a thought this night that if you do not pray for him and bless him...it
      will end miserably. My friend, have you done so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was stung and offended, and could hardly help showing it in spite of
      his mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you done so, Austin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is assuredly a new way of committing fathers to the follies of their
      sons, Emmeline!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not that. But will you pray for your boy, and bless him, before the
      day comes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He restrained himself to pronounce his words calmly:&mdash;&ldquo;And I must do
      this, or it will end in misery? How else can it end? Can I save him from
      the seed he has sown? Consider, Emmeline, what you say. He has repeated
      his cousin&rsquo;s sin. You see the end of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, so different! This young person is not, is not of the class poor
      Austin Wentworth allied himself to. Indeed it is different. And he&mdash;be
      just and admit his nobleness. I fancied you did. This young person has
      great beauty, she has the elements of good breeding, she&mdash;indeed I
      think, had she been in another position, you would not have looked upon
      her unfavourably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may be too good for my son!&rdquo; The baronet spoke with sublime
      bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No woman is too good for Richard, and you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pass her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will speak only of him. He met her by a fatal accident. We thought
      his love dead, and so did he till he saw her again. He met her, he thought
      we were plotting against him, he thought he should lose her for ever, and
      is the madness of an hour he did this....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Emmeline pleads bravely for clandestine matches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! do not trifle, my friend. Say: would you have had him act as young
      men in his position generally do to young women beneath them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin did not like the question. It probed him very severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that fathers must fold their arms, and either submit
      to infamous marriages, or have these creatures ruined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not mean that,&rdquo; exclaimed the lady, striving for what she did mean,
      and how to express it. &ldquo;I mean that he loved her. Is it not a madness at
      his age? But what I chiefly mean is&mdash;save him from the consequences.
      No, you shall not withdraw your hand. Think of his pride, his
      sensitiveness, his great wild nature&mdash;wild when he is set wrong:
      think how intense it is, set upon love; think, my friend, do not forget
      his love for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin smiled an admirable smile of pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I should save him, or any one, from consequences, is asking more
      than the order of things will allow to you, Emmeline, and is not in the
      disposition of this world. I cannot. Consequences are the natural
      offspring of acts. My child, you are talking sentiment, which is the
      distraction of our modern age in everything&mdash;a phantasmal vapour
      distorting the image of the life we live. You ask me to give him a golden
      age in spite of himself. All that could be done, by keeping him in the
      paths of virtue and truth, I did. He is become a man, and as a man he must
      reap his own sowing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baffled lady sighed. He sat so rigid: he spoke so securely, as if
      wisdom were to him more than the love of his son. And yet he did love his
      son. Feeling sure that he loved his son while he spoke so loftily, she
      reverenced him still, baffled as she was, and sensible that she had been
      quibbled with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I ask of you is to open your heart to him,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call him a man,&mdash;he is, and must ever be the child of your
      education, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would console me, Emmeline, with the prospect that, if he ruins
      himself, he spares the world of young women. Yes, that is something!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Closely she scanned the mask. It was impenetrable. He could meet her eyes,
      and respond to the pressure of her hand, and smile, and not show what he
      felt. Nor did he deem it hypocritical to seek to maintain his elevation in
      her soft soul, by simulating supreme philosophy over offended love. Nor
      did he know that he had an angel with him then: a blind angel, and a weak
      one, but one who struck upon his chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I pardoned for coming to you?&rdquo; she said, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely I can read my Emmeline&rsquo;s intentions,&rdquo; he gently replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very poor ones. I feel my weakness. I cannot utter half I have been
      thinking. Oh, if I could!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak very well, Emmeline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, I am pardoned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And before I leave you, dear friend, shall I be forgiven?&mdash;may I beg
      it?&mdash;will you bless him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was again silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray for him, Austin! pray for him ere the night is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she slid down to his feet and pressed his hand to her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baronet was startled. In very dread of the soft fit that wooed him, he
      pushed back his chair, and rose, and went to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s day already!&rdquo; he said with assumed vivacity, throwing open the
      shutters, and displaying the young light on the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Blandish dried her tears as she knelt, and then joined him, and
      glanced up silently at Richard&rsquo;s moon standing in wane toward the West.
      She hoped it was because of her having been premature in pleading so
      earnestly, that she had failed to move him, and she accused herself more
      than the baronet. But in acting as she had done, she had treated him as no
      common man, and she was compelled to perceive that his heart was at
      present hardly superior to the hearts of ordinary men, however composed
      his face might be, and apparently serene his wisdom. From that moment she
      grew critical of him, and began to study her idol&mdash;a process
      dangerous to idols. He, now that she seemed to have relinquished the
      painful subject, drew to her, and as one who wished to smooth a foregone
      roughness, murmured: &ldquo;God&rsquo;s rarest blessing is, after all, a good woman!
      My Emmeline bears her sleepless night well. She does not shame the day.&rdquo;
       He gazed down on her with a fondling tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could bear many, many!&rdquo; she replied, meeting his eyes, &ldquo;and you would
      see me look better and better, if... if only...&rdquo; but she had no
      encouragement to end the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he wanted some mute form of consolation; perhaps the handsome
      placid features of the dark-eyed dame touched him: at any rate their
      Platonism was advanced by his putting an arm about her. She felt the arm
      and talked of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus proximate, they by and by both heard something very like a groan
      behind them, and looking round, beheld the Saurian eye. Lady Blandish
      smiled, but the baronet&rsquo;s discomposure was not to be concealed. By a
      strange fatality every stage of their innocent loves was certain to have a
      human beholder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure I beg pardon,&rdquo; Benson mumbled, arresting his head in a
      melancholy pendulosity. He was ordered out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I think I shall follow him, and try to get forty winks,&rdquo; said Lady
      Blandish. They parted with a quiet squeeze of hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baronet then called in Benson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get me my breakfast as soon as you can,&rdquo; he said, regardless of the
      aspect of injured conscience Benson sombrely presented to him. &ldquo;I am going
      to town early. And, Benson,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you will also go to town this
      afternoon, or to-morrow, if it suits you, and take your book with you to
      Mr. Thompson. You will not return here. A provision will be made for you.
      You can go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heavy butler essayed to speak, but the tremendous blow and the
      baronet&rsquo;s gesture choked him. At the door he made another effort which
      shook the rolls of his loose skin pitiably. An impatient signal sent him
      out dumb,&mdash;and Raynham was quit of the one believer in the Great
      Shaddock dogma.

      CHAPTER XXXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was the month of July. The Solent ran up green waves before a
      full-blowing South-wester. Gay little yachts bounded out like foam, and
      flashed their sails, light as sea-nymphs. A crown of deep Summer blue
      topped the flying mountains of cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      By an open window that looked on the brine through nodding roses, our
      young bridal pair were at breakfast, regaling worthily, both of them. Had
      the Scientific Humanist observed them, he could not have contested the
      fact, that as a couple who had set up to be father and mother of Britons,
      they were doing their duty. Files of egg-cups with disintegrated shells
      bore witness to it, and they were still at work, hardly talking from
      rapidity of exercise. Both were dressed for an expedition. She had her
      bonnet on, and he his yachting-hat. His sleeves were turned over at the
      wrists, and her gown showed its lining on her lap. At times a chance word
      might spring a laugh, but eating was the business of the hour, as I would
      have you to know it always will be where Cupid is in earnest. Tribute
      flowed in to them from the subject land. Neglected lies Love&rsquo;s
      penny-whistle on which they played so prettily and charmed the spheres to
      hear them. What do they care for the spheres, who have one another? Come,
      eggs! come, bread and butter! come, tea with sugar in it and milk! and
      welcome, the jolly hours. That is a fair interpretation of the music in
      them just now. Yonder instrument was good only for the overture. After
      all, what finer aspiration can lovers have, than to be free man and woman
      in the heart of plenty? And is it not a glorious level to have attained?
      Ah, wretched Scientific Humanist! not to be by and mark the admirable
      sight of these young creatures feeding. It would have been a spell to
      exorcise the Manichee, methinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mighty performance came to an end, and then, with a flourish of his
      table-napkin, husband stood over wife, who met him on the confident
      budding of her mouth. The poetry of mortals is their daily prose. Is it
      not a glorious level to have attained? A short, quick-blooded kiss,
      radiant, fresh, and honest as Aurora, and then Richard says without lack
      of cheer, &ldquo;No letter to-day, my Lucy!&rdquo; whereat her sweet eyes dwell on him
      a little seriously, but he cries, &ldquo;Never mind! he&rsquo;ll be coming down
      himself some morning. He has only to know her, and all&rsquo;s well! eh?&rdquo; and so
      saying he puts a hand beneath her chin, and seems to frame her fair face
      in fancy, she smiling up to be looked at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But one thing I do want to ask my darling,&rdquo; says Lucy, and dropped into
      his bosom with hands of petition. &ldquo;Take me on board his yacht with him
      to-day&mdash;not leave me with those people! Will he? I&rsquo;m a good sailor,
      he knows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best afloat!&rdquo; laughs Richard, hugging her, &ldquo;but, you know, you
      darling bit of a sailor, they don&rsquo;t allow more than a certain number on
      board for the race, and if they hear you&rsquo;ve been with me, there&rsquo;ll be
      cries of foul play! Besides, there&rsquo;s Lady Judith to talk to you about
      Austin, and Lord Mountfalcon&rsquo;s compliments for you to listen to, and Mr.
      Morton to take care of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy&rsquo;s eyes fixed sideways an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I don&rsquo;t frown and blush as I did?&rdquo; she said, screwing her pliable
      brows up to him winningly, and he bent his cheek against hers, and
      murmured something delicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we shall be separated for&mdash;how many hours? one, two, three
      hours!&rdquo; she pouted to his flatteries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then I shall come on board to receive my bride&rsquo;s congratulations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then my husband will talk all the time to Lady Judith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then I shall see my wife frowning and blushing at Lord Mountfalcon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I so foolish, Richard?&rdquo; she forgot her trifling to ask in an earnest
      way, and had another Aurorean kiss, just brushing the dew on her lips, for
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      After hiding a month in shyest shade, the pair of happy sinners had
      wandered forth one day to look on men and marvel at them, and had chanced
      to meet Mr. Morton of Poer Hall, Austin Wentworth&rsquo;s friend, and Ralph&rsquo;s
      uncle. Mr. Morton had once been intimate with the baronet, but had given
      him up for many years as impracticable and hopeless, for which reason he
      was the more inclined to regard Richard&rsquo;s misdemeanour charitably, and to
      lay the faults of the son on the father; and thinking society to be the
      one thing requisite to the young man, he had introduced him to the people
      he knew in the island; among others to the Lady Judith Felle, a fair young
      dame, who introduced him to Lord Mountfalcon, a puissant nobleman; who
      introduced him to the yachtsmen beginning to congregate; so that in a few
      weeks he found himself in the centre of a brilliant company, and for the
      first time in his life tasted what it was to have free intercourse with
      his fellow-creatures of both sews. The son of a System was, therefore,
      launched; not only through the surf, but in deep waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the baronet had so far compromised between the recurrence of his
      softer feelings and the suggestions of his new familiar, that he had
      determined to act toward Richard with justness. The world called it
      magnanimity, and even Lady Blandish had some thoughts of the same kind
      when she heard that he had decreed to Richard a handsome allowance, and
      had scouted Mrs. Doria&rsquo;s proposal for him to contest the legality of the
      marriage; but Sir Austin knew well he was simply just in not withholding
      money from a youth so situated. And here again the world deceived him by
      embellishing his conduct. For what is it to be just to whom we love! He
      knew it was not magnanimous, but the cry of the world somehow fortified
      him in the conceit that in dealing perfect justice to his son he was doing
      all that was possible, because so much more than common fathers would have
      done. He had shut his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently Richard did not want money. What he wanted more, and did not
      get, was a word from his father, and though he said nothing to sadden his
      young bride, she felt how much it preyed upon him to be at variance with
      the man whom, now that he had offended him and gone against him, he would
      have fallen on his knees to; the man who was as no other man to him. She
      heard him of nights when she lay by his side, and the darkness, and the
      broken mutterings, of those nights clothed the figure of the strange stern
      man in her mind. Not that it affected the appetites of the pretty pair. We
      must not expect that of Cupid enthroned and in condition; under the
      influence of sea-air, too. The files of egg-cups laugh at such an idea.
      Still the worm did gnaw them. Judge, then, of their delight when, on this
      pleasant morning, as they were issuing from the garden of their cottage to
      go down to the sea, they caught sight of Tom Bakewell rushing up the road
      with a portmanteau on his shoulders, and, some distance behind him,
      discerned Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; shouted Richard, and ran off to meet him, and never left
      his hand till he had hauled him up, firing questions at him all the way,
      to where Lucy stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy! this is Adrian, my cousin.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he an angel?&rdquo; his eyes
      seemed to add; while Lucy&rsquo;s clearly answered, &ldquo;That he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The full-bodied angel ceremoniously bowed to her, and acted with reserved
      unction the benefactor he saw in their greetings. &ldquo;I think we are not
      strangers,&rdquo; he was good enough to remark, and very quickly let them know
      he had not breakfasted; on hearing which they hurried him into the house,
      and Lucy put herself in motion to have him served.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old Rady,&rdquo; said Richard, tugging at his hand again, &ldquo;how glad I am
      you&rsquo;ve come! I don&rsquo;t mind telling you we&rsquo;ve been horridly wretched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six, seven, eight, nine eggs,&rdquo; was Adrian&rsquo;s comment on a survey of the
      breakfast-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t he write? Why didn&rsquo;t he answer one of my letters? But here
      you are, so I don&rsquo;t mind now. He wants to see us, does he? We&rsquo;ll go up
      to-night. I&rsquo;ve a match on at eleven; my little yacht&mdash;I&rsquo;ve called her
      the &lsquo;Blandish&rsquo;&mdash;against Fred Cuirie&rsquo;s &lsquo;Begum.&rsquo; I shall beat, but
      whether I do or not, we&rsquo;ll go up to-night. What&rsquo;s the news? What are they
      all doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy!&rdquo; Adrian returned, sitting comfortably down, &ldquo;let me put
      myself a little more on an equal footing with you before I undertake to
      reply. Half that number of eggs will be sufficient for an unmarried man,
      and then we&rsquo;ll talk. They&rsquo;re all very well, as well as I can recollect
      after the shaking my total vacuity has had this morning. I came over by
      the first boat, and the sea, the sea has made me love mother earth, and
      desire of her fruits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard fretted restlessly opposite his cool relative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adrian! what did he say when he heard of it? I want to know exactly what
      words he said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well says the sage, my son! &lsquo;Speech is the small change of Silence.&rsquo; He
      said less than I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how he took it!&rdquo; cried Richard, and plunged in meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the table was cleared, and laid out afresh, and Lucy preceded the
      maid bearing eggs on the tray, and sat down unbonneted, and like a
      thorough-bred housewife, to pour out the tea for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll commence,&rdquo; said Adrian, tapping his egg with meditative
      cheerfulness; but his expression soon changed to one of pain, all the more
      alarming for his benevolent efforts to conceal it. Could it be possible
      the egg was bad? oh, horror! Lucy watched him, and waited in trepidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This egg has boiled three minutes and three-quarters,&rdquo; he observed,
      ceasing to contemplate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear!&rdquo; said Lucy, &ldquo;I boiled them myself exactly that time. Richard
      likes them so. And you like them hard, Mr. Harley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I like them soft. Two minutes and a half, or
      three-quarters at the outside. An egg should never rashly verge upon
      hardness&mdash;never. Three minutes is the excess of temerity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Richard had told me! If I had only known!&rdquo; the lovely little hostess
      interjected ruefully, biting her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t expect him to pay attention to such matters,&rdquo; said Adrian,
      trying to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it! there are more eggs in the house,&rdquo; cried Richard, and pulled
      savagely at the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy jumped up, saying, &ldquo;Oh, yes! I will go and boil some exactly the time
      you like. Pray let me go, Mr. Harley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian restrained her departure with a motion of his hand. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;I will be ruled by Richard&rsquo;s tastes, and heaven grant me his digestion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy threw a sad look at Richard, who stretched on a sofa, and left the
      burden of the entertainment entirely to her. The eggs were a melancholy
      beginning, but her ardour to please Adrian would not be damped, and she
      deeply admired his resignation. If she failed in pleasing this glorious
      herald of peace, no matter by what small misadventure, she apprehended
      calamity; so there sat this fair dove with brows at work above her serious
      smiling blue eyes, covertly studying every aspect of the plump-faced
      epicure, that she might learn to propitiate him. &ldquo;He shall not think me
      timid and stupid,&rdquo; thought this brave girl, and indeed Adrian was
      astonished to find that she could both chat and be useful, as well as look
      ornamental. When he had finished one egg, behold, two fresh ones came in,
      boiled according to his prescription. She had quietly given her orders to
      the maid, and he had them without fuss. Possibly his look of dismay at the
      offending eggs had not been altogether involuntary, and her woman&rsquo;s
      instinct, inexperienced as she was, may have told her that he had come
      prepared to be not very well satisfied with anything in Love&rsquo;s cottage.
      There was mental faculty in those pliable brows to see through, and
      combat, an unwitting wise youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      How much she had achieved already she partly divined when Adrian said: &ldquo;I
      think now I&rsquo;m in case to answer your questions, my dear boy&mdash;thanks
      to Mrs. Richard,&rdquo; and he bowed to her his first direct acknowledgment of
      her position. Lucy thrilled with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Richard, and settled easily on his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To begin, the Pilgrim has lost his Note-book, and has been persuaded to
      offer a reward which shall maintain the happy finder thereof in an asylum
      for life. Benson&mdash;superlative Benson&mdash;has turned his shoulders
      upon Raynham. None know whither he has departed. It is believed that the
      sole surviving member of the sect of the Shaddock-Dogmatists is under a
      total eclipse of Woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benson gone?&rdquo; Richard exclaimed. &ldquo;What a tremendous time it seems since I
      left Raynham!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is, my dear boy. The honeymoon is Mahomet&rsquo;s minute; or say, the
      Persian King&rsquo;s water-pail that you read of in the story: You dip your head
      in it, and when you draw it out, you discover that you have lived a life.
      To resume your uncle Algernon still roams in pursuit of the lost one&mdash;I
      should say, hops. Your uncle Hippias has a new and most perplexing
      symptom; a determination of bride-cake to the nose. Ever since your
      generous present to him, though he declares he never consumed a morsel of
      it, he has been under the distressing illusion that his nose is enormous,
      and I assure you he exhibits quite a maidenly timidity in following it&mdash;through
      a doorway, for instance. He complains of its terrible weight. I have
      conceived that Benson invisible might be sitting on it. His hand, and the
      doctor&rsquo;s, are in hourly consultation with it, but I fear it will not grow
      smaller. The Pilgrim has begotten upon it a new Aphorism: that Size is a
      matter of opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor uncle Hippy!&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;I wonder he doesn&rsquo;t believe in magic.
      There&rsquo;s nothing supernatural to rival the wonderful sensations he does
      believe in. Good God! fancy coming to that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo; Lucy protested, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t help laughing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charming to the wise youth her pretty laughter sounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Pilgrim has your notion, Richard. Whom does he not forestall?
      &lsquo;Confirmed dyspepsia is the apparatus of illusions,&rsquo; and he accuses the
      Ages that put faith in sorcery, of universal indigestion, which may have
      been the case, owing to their infamous cookery. He says again, if you
      remember, that our own Age is travelling back to darkness and ignorance
      through dyspepsia. He lays the seat of wisdom in the centre of our system,
      Mrs. Richard: for which reason you will understand how sensible I am of
      the vast obligation I am under to you at the present moment, for your
      especial care of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard looked on at Lucy&rsquo;s little triumph, attributing Adrian&rsquo;s
      subjugation to her beauty and sweetness. She had latterly received a great
      many compliments on that score, which she did not care to hear, and
      Adrian&rsquo;s homage to a practical quality was far pleasanter to the young
      wife, who shrewdly guessed that her beauty would not help her much in the
      struggle she had now to maintain. Adrian continuing to lecture on the
      excelling virtues of wise cookery, a thought struck her: Where, where had
      she tossed Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s book?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s all about the home-people?&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All!&rdquo; replied Adrian. &ldquo;Or stay: you know Clare&rsquo;s going to be married?
      Not? Your Aunt Helen&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bother my Aunt Helen! What do you think she had the impertinence to
      write&mdash;but never mind! Is it to Ralph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Aunt Helen, I was going to say, my dear boy, is an extraordinary
      woman. It was from her originally that the Pilgrim first learnt to call
      the female the practical animal. He studies us all, you know. The
      Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip is the abstract portraiture of his surrounding relatives.
      Well, your Aunt Helen&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Doria Battledoria!&rdquo; laughed Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;being foiled in a little pet scheme of her own&mdash;call it a
      System if you like&mdash;of some ten or fifteen years&rsquo; standing, with
      regard to Miss Clare!&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fair Shuttlecockiana!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;instead of fretting like a man, and questioning Providence, and
      turning herself and everybody else inside out, and seeing the world upside
      down, what does the practical animal do? She wanted to marry her to
      somebody she couldn&rsquo;t marry her to, so she resolved instantly to marry her
      to somebody she could marry her to: and as old gentlemen enter into these
      transactions with the practical animal the most readily, she fixed upon an
      old gentleman; an unmarried old gentleman, a rich old gentleman, and now a
      captive old gentleman. The ceremony takes place in about a week from the
      present time. No doubt you will receive your invitation in a day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that cold, icy, wretched Clare has consented to marry an old man!&rdquo;
       groaned Richard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put a stop to that when I go to town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard got up and strode about the room. Then he bethought him it was
      time to go on board and make preparations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Adrian, you&rsquo;ll take her. She goes in the Empress,
      Mountfalcon&rsquo;s vessel. He starts us. A little schooner-yacht&mdash;such a
      beauty! I&rsquo;ll have one like her some day. Good-bye, darling!&rdquo; he whispered
      to Lucy, and his hand and eyes lingered on her, and hers on him, seeking
      to make up for the priceless kiss they were debarred from. But she quickly
      looked away from him as he held her:&mdash;Adrian stood silent: his brows
      were up, and his mouth dubiously contracted. He spoke at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on the water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s only to St. Helen&rsquo;s. Short and sharp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you grudge me the nourishment my poor system has just received, my
      son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bother your system! Put on your hat, and come along. I&rsquo;ll put you on
      board in my boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard! I have already paid the penalty of them who are condemned to
      come to an island. I will go with you to the edge of the sea, and I will
      meet you there when you return, and take up the Tale of the Tritons: but,
      though I forfeit the pleasure of Mrs. Richard&rsquo;s company, I refuse to quit
      the land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, oh, Mr. Harley!&rdquo; Lucy broke from her husband, &ldquo;and I will stay with
      you, if you please. I don&rsquo;t want to go among those people, and we can see
      it all from the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest! I don&rsquo;t want to go. You don&rsquo;t mind? Of course, I will go if you
      wish, but I would so much rather stay;&rdquo; and she lengthened her plea in her
      attitude and look to melt the discontent she saw gathering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian protested that she had much better go; that he could amuse himself
      very well till their return, and so forth; but she had schemes in her
      pretty head, and held to it to be allowed to stay in spite of Lord
      Mountfalcon&rsquo;s disappointment, cited by Richard, and at the great risk of
      vexing her darling, as she saw. Richard pished, and glanced contemptuously
      at Adrian. He gave way ungraciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, do as you like. Get your things ready to leave this evening. No,
      I&rsquo;m not angry.&rdquo;&mdash;Who could be? he seemed as he looked up from her
      modest fondling to ask Adrian, and seized the indemnity of a kiss on her
      forehead, which, however, did not immediately disperse the shade of
      annoyance he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Such a day as this, and a fellow refuses to
      come on the water! Well, come along to the edge of the sea.&rdquo; Adrian&rsquo;s
      angelic quality had quite worn off to him. He never thought of devoting
      himself to make the most of the material there was: but somebody else did,
      and that fair somebody succeeded wonderfully in a few short hours. She
      induced Adrian to reflect that the baronet had only to see her, and the
      family muddle would be smoothed at once. He came to it by degrees; still
      the gradations were rapid. Her manner he liked; she was certainly a nice
      picture: best of all, she was sensible. He forgot the farmer&rsquo;s niece in
      her, she was so very sensible. She appeared really to understand that it
      was a woman&rsquo;s duty to know how to cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the difficulty was, by what means the baronet could be brought to
      consent to see her. He had not yet consented to see his son, and Adrian,
      spurred by Lady Blandish, had ventured something in coming down. He was
      not inclined to venture more. The small debate in his mind ended by his
      throwing the burden on time. Time would bring the matter about. Christians
      as well as Pagans are in the habit of phrasing this excuse for folding
      their arms; &ldquo;forgetful,&rdquo; says The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip, &ldquo;that the devil&rsquo;s imps
      enter into no such armistice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she loitered along the shore with her amusing companion, Lucy had many
      things to think of. There was her darling&rsquo;s match. The yachts were started
      by pistol-shot by Lord Mountfalcon on board the Empress, and her little
      heart beat after Richard&rsquo;s straining sails. Then there was the strangeness
      of walking with a relative of Richard&rsquo;s, one who had lived by his side so
      long. And the thought that perhaps this night she would have to appear
      before the dreaded father of her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Mr. Harley!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is it true&mdash;are we to go tonight? And me,&rdquo;
       she faltered, &ldquo;will he see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that is what I wanted to talk to you about,&rdquo; said Adrian. &ldquo;I made
      some reply to our dear boy which he has slightly misinterpreted. Our
      second person plural is liable to misconstruction by an ardent mind. I
      said &lsquo;see you,&rsquo; and he supposed&mdash;now, Mrs. Richard, I am sure you
      will understand me. Just at present perhaps it would be advisable&mdash;when
      the father and son have settled their accounts, the daughter-in-law can&rsquo;t
      be a debtor.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy threw up her blue eyes. A half-cowardly delight at the chance of a
      respite from the awful interview made her quickly apprehensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Mr. Harley! you think he should go alone first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is my notion. But the fact is, he is such an excellent husband
      that I fancy it will require more than a man&rsquo;s power of persuasion to get
      him to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I will persuade him, Mr. Harley.&rdquo; &ldquo;Perhaps, if you would...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing I would not do for his happiness,&rdquo; murmured Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wise youth pressed her hand with lymphatic approbation. They walked on
      till the yachts had rounded the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it to-night, Mr. Harley?&rdquo; she asked with some trouble in her voice now
      that her darling was out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t imagine your eloquence even will get him to leave you to-night,&rdquo;
       Adrian replied gallantly. &ldquo;Besides, I must speak for myself. To achieve
      the passage to an island is enough for one day. No necessity exists for
      any hurry, except in the brain of that impetuous boy. You must correct it,
      Mrs. Richard. Men are made to be managed, and women are born managers.
      Now, if you were to let him know that you don&rsquo;t want to go to-night, and
      let him guess, after a day or two, that you would very much rather... you
      might affect a peculiar repugnance. By taking it on yourself, you see,
      this wild young man will not require such frightful efforts of persuasion.
      Both his father and he are exceedingly delicate subjects, and his father
      unfortunately is not in a position to be managed directly. It&rsquo;s a strange
      office to propose to you, but it appears to devolve upon you to manage the
      father through the son. Prodigal having made his peace, you, who have done
      all the work from a distance, naturally come into the circle of the
      paternal smile, knowing it due to you. I see no other way. If Richard
      suspects that his father objects for the present to welcome his
      daughter-in-law, hostilities will be continued, the breach will be
      widened, bad will grow to worse, and I see no end to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian looked in her face, as much as to say: Now are you capable of this
      piece of heroism? And it did seem hard to her that she should have to tell
      Richard she shrank from any trial. But the proposition chimed in with her
      fears and her wishes: she thought the wise youth very wise: the poor child
      was not insensible to his flattery, and the subtler flattery of making
      herself in some measure a sacrifice to the home she had disturbed. She
      agreed to simulate as Adrian had suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Victory is the commonest heritage of the hero, and when Richard came on
      shore proclaiming that the Blandish had beaten the Begum by seven minutes
      and three-quarters, he was hastily kissed and congratulated by his bride
      with her fingers among the leaves of Dr. Kitchener, and anxiously
      questioned about wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest! Mr. Harley wants to stay with us a little, and he thinks we
      ought not to go immediately&mdash;that is, before he has had some letters,
      and I feel... I would so much rather...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s it, you coward!&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;Well, then, to-morrow. We had
      a splendid race. Did you see us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! I saw you and was sure my darling would win.&rdquo; And again she
      threw on him the cold water of that solicitude about wine. &ldquo;Mr. Harley
      must have the best, you know, and we never drink it, and I&rsquo;m so silly, I
      don&rsquo;t know good wine, and if you would send Tom where he can get good
      wine. I have seen to the dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why you didn&rsquo;t come to meet me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do, but Mountfalcon doesn&rsquo;t, and Lady Judith thinks you ought to
      have been there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but my heart was with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard put his hand to feel for the little heart: her eyelids softened,
      and she ran away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to say much of the dinner that Adrian found no fault with it, and
      was in perfect good-humour at the conclusion of the service. He did not
      abuse the wine they were able to procure for him, which was also much. The
      coffee, too, had the honour of passing without comment. These were sound
      first steps toward the conquest of an epicure, and as yet Cupid did not
      grumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      After coffee they strolled out to see the sun set from Lady Judith&rsquo;s
      grounds. The wind had dropped. The clouds had rolled from the zenith, and
      ranged in amphitheatre with distant flushed bodies over sea and land:
      Titanic crimson head and chest rising from the wave faced Hyperion
      falling. There hung Briareus with deep-indented trunk and ravined brows,
      stretching all his hands up to unattainable blue summits. North-west the
      range had a rich white glow, as if shining to the moon, and westward,
      streams of amber, melting into upper rose, shot out from the dipping disk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Sandoe calls the passion-flower of heaven,&rdquo; said Richard under his
      breath to Adrian, who was serenely chanting Greek hexameters, and
      answered, in the swing of the caesura, &ldquo;He might as well have said
      cauliflower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Judith, with a black lace veil tied over her head, met them in the
      walk. She was tall and dark; dark-haired, dark-eyed, sweet and persuasive
      in her accent and manner. &ldquo;A second edition of the Blandish,&rdquo; thinks
      Adrian. She welcomed him as one who had claims on her affability. She
      kissed Lucy protectingly, and remarking on the wonders of the evening,
      appropriated her husband. Adrian and Lucy found themselves walking behind
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was under. All the spaces of the sky were alight, and Richard&rsquo;s
      fancy flamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re not intoxicated with your immense triumph this morning?&rdquo; said
      Lady Judith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh at me. When it&rsquo;s over I feel ashamed of the trouble I&rsquo;ve
      taken. Look at that glory!&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure you despise me for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I not there to applaud you? I only think such energies should be
      turned into some definitely useful channel. But you must not go into the
      Army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else can I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are fit for so much that is better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never can be anything like Austin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I think you can do more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I thank you for thinking it, Lady Judith. Something I will do. A
      man must deserve to live, as you say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sauces,&rdquo; Adrian was heard to articulate distinctly in the rear, &ldquo;Sauces
      are the top tree of this science. A woman who has mastered sauces sits on
      the apex of civilization.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Briareus reddened duskily seaward. The West was all a burning rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can men see such sights as those, and live idle?&rdquo; Richard resumed. &ldquo;I
      feel ashamed of asking my men to work for me.&mdash;Or I feel so now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not when you&rsquo;re racing the Begum, I think. There&rsquo;s no necessity for you
      to turn democrat like Austin. Do you write now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. What is writing like mine? It doesn&rsquo;t deceive me. I know it&rsquo;s only
      the excuse I&rsquo;m making to myself for remaining idle. I haven&rsquo;t written a
      line since&mdash;lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you are so happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not because of that. Of course I&rsquo;m very happy...&rdquo; He did not finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vague, shapeless ambition had replaced love in yonder skies. No Scientific
      Humanist was by to study the natural development, and guide him. This lady
      would hardly be deemed a very proper guide to the undirected energies of
      the youth, yet they had established relations of that nature. She was five
      years older than he, and a woman, which may explain her serene
      presumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloud-giants had broken up: a brawny shoulder smouldered over the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll work together in town, at all events,&rdquo; said Richard,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we go about together at night and find out people who want
      help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Judith smiled, and only corrected his nonsense by saying, &ldquo;I think we
      mustn&rsquo;t be too romantic. You will become a knight-errant, I suppose. You
      have the characteristics of one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Especially at breakfast,&rdquo; Adrian&rsquo;s unnecessarily emphatic gastronomical
      lessons to the young wife here came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be our champion,&rdquo; continued Lady Judith: &ldquo;the rescuer and
      succourer of distressed dames and damsels. We want one badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do,&rdquo; said Richard, earnestly: &ldquo;from what I hear: from what I know!&rdquo;
       His thoughts flew off with him as knight-errant hailed shrilly at
      exceeding critical moment by distressed dames and damsels. Images of airy
      towers hung around. His fancy performed miraculous feats. The towers
      crumbled. The stars grew larger, seemed to throb with lustre. His fancy
      crumbled with the towers of the air, his heart gave a leap, he turned to
      Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling! what have you been doing?&rdquo; And as if to compensate her for
      his little knight-errant infidelity, he pressed very tenderly to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been engaged in a charming conversation on domestic cookery,&rdquo;
       interposed Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cookery! such an evening as this?&rdquo; His face was a handsome likeness of
      Hippias at the presentation of bridecake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest! you know it&rsquo;s very useful,&rdquo; Lucy mirthfully pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I quite agree with you, child,&rdquo; said Lady Judith, &ldquo;and I think you
      have the laugh of us. I certainly will learn to cook some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woman&rsquo;s mission, in so many words,&rdquo; ejaculated Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, what is man&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To taste thereof, and pronounce thereupon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us give it up to them,&rdquo; said Lady Judith to Richard. &ldquo;You and I never
      will make so delightful and beautifully balanced a world of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard appeared to have grown perfectly willing to give everything up to
      the fair face, his bridal Hesper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neat day Lucy had to act the coward anew, and, as she did so, her heart
      sank to see how painfully it affected him that she should hesitate to go
      with him to his father. He was patient, gentle; he sat down by her side to
      appeal to her reason, and used all the arguments he could think of to
      persuade her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we go together and make him see us both: if he sees he has nothing to
      be ashamed of in you&mdash;rather everything to be proud of; if you are
      only near him, you will not have to speak a word, and I&rsquo;m certain&mdash;as
      certain as that I live&mdash;that in a week we shall be settled happily at
      Raynham. I know my father so well, Lucy. Nobody knows him but I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy asked whether Mr. Harley did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adrian? Not a bit. Adrian only knows a part of people, Lucy; and not the
      best part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy was disposed to think more highly of the object of her conquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it he that has been frightening you, Lucy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Richard; oh, dear no!&rdquo; she cried, and looked at him more tenderly
      because she was not quite truthful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know my father at all,&rdquo; said Richard. But Lucy had another
      opinion of the wise youth, and secretly maintained it. She could not be
      won to imagine the baronet a man of human mould, generous, forgiving, full
      of passionate love at heart, as Richard tried to picture him, and thought
      him, now that he beheld him again through Adrian&rsquo;s embassy. To her he was
      that awful figure, shrouded by the midnight. &ldquo;Why are you so harsh?&rdquo; she
      had heard Richard cry more than once. She was sure that Adrian must be
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I tell you I won&rsquo;t go without you,&rdquo; said Richard, and Lucy begged
      for a little more time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cupid now began to grumble, and with cause. Adrian positively refused to
      go on the water unless that element were smooth as a plate. The South-west
      still joked boisterously at any comparison of the sort; the days were
      magnificent; Richard had yachting engagements; and Lucy always petitioned
      to stay to keep Adrian company, concerning it her duty as hostess. Arguing
      with Adrian was an absurd idea. If Richard hinted at his retaining Lucy,
      the wise youth would remark: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wholesome interlude to your extremely
      Cupidinous behaviour, my dear boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard asked his wife what they could possibly find to talk about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All manner of things,&rdquo; said Lucy; &ldquo;not only cookery. He is so amusing,
      though he does make fun of The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip, and I think he ought not.
      And then, do you know, darling&mdash;you won&rsquo;t think me vain?&mdash;I
      think he is beginning to like me a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard laughed at the humble mind of his Beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t everybody like you, admire you? Doesn&rsquo;t Lord Mountfalcon, and Mr.
      Morton, and Lady Judith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is one of your family, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they all will, if she isn&rsquo;t a coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, no!&rdquo; she sighs, and is chidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conquest of an epicure, or any young wife&rsquo;s conquest beyond her
      husband, however loyally devised for their mutual happiness, may be costly
      to her. Richard in his hours of excitement was thrown very much with Lady
      Judith. He consulted her regarding what he termed Lucy&rsquo;s cowardice. Lady
      Judith said: &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s wrong, but you must learn to humour little
      women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then would you advise me to go up alone?&rdquo; he asked, with a cloudy
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else can you do? Be reconciled yourself as quickly as you can. You
      can&rsquo;t drag her like a captive, you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is not pleasant for a young husband, fancying his bride the peerless
      flower of Creation, to learn that he must humour a little woman in her. It
      was revolting to Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I fear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is, that my father will make it smooth with me,
      and not acknowledge her: so that whenever I go to him, I shall have to
      leave her, and tit for tat&mdash;an abominable existence, like a ball on a
      billiard-table. I won&rsquo;t bear that ignominy. And this I know, I know! she
      might prevent it at once, if she would only be brave, and face it. You,
      you, Lady Judith, you wouldn&rsquo;t be a coward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where my old lord tells me to go, I go,&rdquo; the lady coldly replied.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much merit in that. Pray, don&rsquo;t cite me. Women are born
      cowards, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I love the women who are not cowards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little thing&mdash;your wife has not refused to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;but tears! Who can stand tears?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy had come to drop them. Unaccustomed to have his will thwarted, and
      urgent where he saw the thing to do so clearly, the young husband had
      spoken strong words: and she, who knew that she would have given her life
      by inches for him; who knew that she was playing a part for his happiness,
      and hiding for his sake the nature that was worthy his esteem; the poor
      little martyr had been weak a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had Adrian&rsquo;s support. The wise youth was very comfortable. He liked
      the air of the Island, and he liked being petted. &ldquo;A nice little woman! a
      very nice little woman!&rdquo; Tom Bakewell heard him murmur to himself
      according to a habit he had; and his air of rather succulent patronage as
      he walked or sat beside the innocent Beauty, with his head thrown back and
      a smile that seemed always to be in secret communion with his marked
      abdominal prominence, showed that she was gaining part of what she played
      for. Wise youths who buy their loves, are not unwilling, when opportunity
      offers, to try and obtain the commodity for nothing. Examinations of her
      hand, as for some occult purpose, and unctuous pattings of the same, were
      not infrequent. Adrian waxed now and then Anacreontic in his compliments.
      Lucy would say: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s worse than Lord Mountfalcon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better English than the noble lord deigns to employ&mdash;allow that?&rdquo;
       quoth Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very kind,&rdquo; said Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To all, save to our noble vernacular,&rdquo; added Adrian. &ldquo;He seems to scent a
      rival to his dignity there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may be that Adrian scented a rival to his lymphatic emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are at our ease here in excellent society,&rdquo; he wrote to Lady Blandish.
      &ldquo;I am bound to confess that the Huron has a happy fortune, or a
      superlative instinct. Blindfold he has seized upon a suitable mate. She
      can look at a lord, and cook for an epicure. Besides Dr. Kitchener, she
      reads and comments on The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip. The `Love&rsquo; chapter, of course,
      takes her fancy. That picture of Woman, `Drawn by Reverence and coloured
      by Love,&rsquo; she thinks beautiful, and repeats it, tossing up pretty eyes.
      Also the lover&rsquo;s petition: &lsquo;Give me purity to be worthy the good in her,
      and grant her patience to reach the good in me.&rsquo; &lsquo;Tis quite taking to hear
      her lisp it. Be sure that I am repeating the petition! I make her read me
      her choice passages. She has not a bad voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lady Judith I spoke of is Austin&rsquo;s Miss Menteith, married to the
      incapable old Lord Felle, or Fellow, as the wits here call him. Lord
      Mountfalcon is his cousin, and her&mdash;what? She has been trying to find
      out, but they have both got over their perplexity, and act respectively
      the bad man reproved and the chaste counsellor; a position in which our
      young couple found them, and haply diverted its perils. They had quite
      taken them in hand. Lady Judith undertakes to cure the fair Papist of a
      pretty, modest trick of frowning and blushing when addressed, and his
      lordship directs the exuberant energies of the original man. &lsquo;Tis thus we
      fulfil our destinies, and are content. Sometimes they change pupils; my
      lord educates the little dame, and my lady the hope of Raynham. Joy and
      blessings unto all! as the German poet sings. Lady Judith accepted the
      hand of her decrepit lord that she might be of potent service to her
      fellow-creatures. Austin, you know, had great hopes of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have for the first time in my career a field of lords to study. I think
      it is not without meaning that I am introduced to it by a yeoman&rsquo;s niece.
      The language of the two social extremes is similar. I find it to consist
      in an instinctively lavish use of vowels and adjectives. My lord and
      Farmer Blaize speak the same tongue, only my lord&rsquo;s has lost its backbone,
      and is limp, though fluent. Their pursuits are identical; but that one has
      money, or, as the Pilgrim terms it, vantage, and the other has not. Their
      ideas seem to have a special relationship in the peculiarity of stopping
      where they have begun. Young Tom Blaize with vantage would be Lord
      Mountfalcon. Even in the character of their parasites I see a resemblance,
      though I am bound to confess that the Hon. Peter Brayder, who is my lord&rsquo;s
      parasite, is by no means noxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This sounds dreadfully democrat. Pray, don&rsquo;t be alarmed. The discovery of
      the affinity between the two extremes of the Royal British Oak has made me
      thrice conservative. I see now that the national love of a lord is less
      subservience than a form of self-love; putting a gold-lace hat on one&rsquo;s
      image, as it were, to bow to it. I see, too, the admirable wisdom of our
      system:&mdash;could there be a finer balance of power than in a community
      where men intellectually nil, have lawful vantage and a gold-lace hat on?
      How soothing it is to intellect&mdash;that noble rebel, as the Pilgrim has
      it&mdash;to stand, and bow, and know itself superior! This exquisite
      compensation maintains the balance: whereas that period anticipated by the
      Pilgrim, when science shall have produced an intellectual aristocracy, is
      indeed horrible to contemplate. For what despotism is so black as one the
      mind cannot challenge? &lsquo;Twill be an iron Age. Wherefore, madam, I cry, and
      shall continue to cry, &lsquo;Vive Lord Mountfalcon! long may he sip his
      Burgundy! long may the bacon-fed carry him on their shoulders!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Morton (who does me the honour to call me Young Mephisto, and
      Socrates missed) leaves to-morrow to get Master Ralph out of a scrape. Our
      Richard has just been elected member of a Club for the promotion of
      nausea. Is he happy? you ask. As much so as one who has had the misfortune
      to obtain what he wanted can be. Speed is his passion. He races from point
      to point. In emulation of Leander and Don Juan, he swam, I hear, to the
      opposite shores the other day, or some world-shaking feat of the sort:
      himself the Hero whom he went to meet: or, as they who pun say, his Hero
      was a Bet. A pretty little domestic episode occurred this morning. He
      finds her abstracted in the fire of his caresses: she turns shy and seeks
      solitude: green jealousy takes hold of him: he lies in wait, and discovers
      her with his new rival&mdash;a veteran edition of the culinary Doctor!
      Blind to the Doctor&rsquo;s great national services, deaf to her wild music, he
      grasps the intruder, dismembers him, and performs upon him the treatment
      he has recommended for dressed cucumber. Tears and shrieks accompany the
      descent of the gastronome. Down she rushes to secure the cherished
      fragments: he follows: they find him, true to his character, alighted and
      straggling over a bed of blooming flowers. Yet ere a fairer flower can
      gather him, a heel black as Pluto stamps him into earth, flowers and all:&mdash;happy
      burial! Pathetic tribute to his merit is watering his grave, when by
      saunters my Lord Mountfalcon. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the mattah?&rsquo; says his lordship,
      soothing his moustache. They break apart, and &lsquo;tis left to me to explain
      from the window. My lord looks shocked, Richard is angry with her for
      having to be ashamed of himself, Beauty dries her eyes, and after a pause
      of general foolishness, the business of life is resumed. I may add that
      the Doctor has just been dug up, and we are busy, in the enemy&rsquo;s absence,
      renewing old Aeson with enchanted threads. By the way, a Papist priest has
      blest them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A month had passed when Adrian wrote this letter. He was very comfortable;
      so of course he thought Time was doing his duty. Not a word did he say of
      Richard&rsquo;s return, and for some reason or other neither Richard nor Lucy
      spoke of it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Blandish wrote back: &ldquo;His father thinks he has refused to come to
      him. By your utter silence on the subject, I fear that it must be so. Make
      him come. Bring him by force. Insist on his coming. Is he mad? He must
      come at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this Adrian replied, after a contemplative comfortable lapse of a day
      or two, which might be laid to his efforts to adopt the lady&rsquo;s advice,
      &ldquo;The point is that the half man declines to come without the whole man.
      The terrible question of sex is our obstruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Blandish was in despair. She had no positive assurance that the
      baronet would see his son; the mask put them all in the dark; but she
      thought she saw in Sir Austin irritation that the offender, at least when
      the opening to come and make his peace seemed to be before him, should let
      days and weeks go by. She saw through the mask sufficiently not to have
      any hope of his consenting to receive the couple at present; she was sure
      that his equanimity was fictitious; but she pierced no farther, or she
      might have started and asked herself, Is this the heart of a woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady at last wrote to Richard. She said: &ldquo;Come instantly, and come
      alone.&rdquo; Then Richard, against his judgment, gave way. &ldquo;My father is not
      the man I thought him!&rdquo; he exclaimed sadly, and Lucy felt his eyes saying
      to her: &ldquo;And you, too, are not the woman I thought you.&rdquo; Nothing could the
      poor little heart reply but strain to his bosom and sleeplessly pray in
      his arms all the night.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three weeks after Richard arrived in town, his cousin Clare was married,
      under the blessings of her energetic mother, and with the approbation of
      her kinsfolk, to the husband that had been expeditiously chosen for her.
      The gentleman, though something more than twice the age of his bride, had
      no idea of approaching senility for many long connubial years to come.
      Backed by his tailor and his hairdresser, he presented no such bad figure
      at the altar, and none would have thought that he was an ancient admirer
      of his bride&rsquo;s mama, as certainly none knew he had lately proposed for
      Mrs. Doria before there was any question of her daughter. These things
      were secrets; and the elastic and happy appearance of Mr. John Todhunter
      did not betray them at the altar. Perhaps he would rather have married the
      mother. He was a man of property, well born, tolerably well educated, and
      had, when Mrs. Doria rejected him for the first time, the reputation of
      being a fool&mdash;which a wealthy man may have in his youth; but as he
      lived on, and did not squander his money&mdash;amassed it, on the
      contrary, and did not seek to go into Parliament, and did other negative
      wise things, the world&rsquo;s opinion, as usual, veered completely round, and
      John Todhunter was esteemed a shrewd, sensible man&mdash;only not
      brilliant; that he was brilliant could not be said of him. In fact, the
      man could hardly talk, and it was a fortunate provision that no impromptu
      deliveries were required of him in the marriage-service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doria had her own reasons for being in a hurry. She had discovered
      something of the strange impassive nature of her child; not from any
      confession of Clare&rsquo;s, but from signs a mother can read when, her eyes are
      not resolutely shut. She saw with alarm and anguish that Clare had fallen
      into the pit she had been digging for her so laboriously. In vain she
      entreated the baronet to break the disgraceful, and, as she said, illegal
      alliance his son had contracted. Sir Austin would not even stop the little
      pension to poor Berry. &ldquo;At least you will do that, Austin,&rdquo; she begged
      pathetically. &ldquo;You will show your sense of that horrid woman&rsquo;s conduct?&rdquo;
       He refused to offer up any victim to console her. Then Mrs. Doria told him
      her thoughts,&mdash;and when an outraged energetic lady is finally brought
      to exhibit these painfully hoarded treasures, she does not use half words
      as a medium. His System, and his conduct generally were denounced to him,
      without analysis. She let him understand that the world laughed at him;
      and he heard this from her at a time when his mask was still soft and
      liable to be acted on by his nerves. &ldquo;You are weak, Austin! weak, I tell
      you!&rdquo; she said, and, like all angry and self-interested people, prophecy
      came easy to her. In her heart she accused him of her own fault, in
      imputing to him the wreck of her project. The baronet allowed her to revel
      in the proclamation of a dire future, and quietly counselled her to keep
      apart from him, which his sister assured him she would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to be passive in calamity is the province of no woman. Mark the race
      at any hour. &ldquo;What revolution and hubbub does not that little instrument,
      the needle, avert from us!&rdquo; says The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip. Alas, that in
      calamity women cannot stitch! Now that she saw Clare wanted other than
      iron, it struck her she must have a husband, and be made secure as a woman
      and a wife. This seemed the thing to do: and, as she had forced the iron
      down Clare&rsquo;s throat, so she forced the husband, and Clare gulped at the
      latter as she had at the former. On the very day that Mrs. Doria had this
      new track shaped out before her, John Todhunter called at the Foreys&rsquo;.
      &ldquo;Old John!&rdquo; sang out Mrs. Doria, &ldquo;show him up to me. I want to see him
      particularly.&rdquo; He sat with her alone. He was a man multitudes of women
      would have married&mdash;whom will they not?&mdash;and who would have
      married any presentable woman: but women do want asking, and John never
      had the word. The rape of such men is left to the practical animal. So
      John sat alone with his old flame. He had become resigned to her perpetual
      lamentation and living Suttee for his defunct rival. But, ha! what meant
      those soft glances now&mdash;addressed to him? His tailor and his
      hairdresser gave youth to John, but they had not the art to bestow upon
      him distinction, and an undistinguished man what woman looks at? John was
      an indistinguishable man. For that reason he was dry wood to a soft
      glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now she said: &ldquo;It is time you should marry; and you are the man to be
      the guide and helper of a young woman, John. You are well preserved&mdash;younger
      than most of the young men of our day. You are eminently domestic, a good
      son, and will be a good husband and good father. Some one you must marry.&mdash;What
      do you think of Clare for a wife for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At first John Todhunter thought it would be very much like his marrying a
      baby. However, he listened to it, and that was enough for Mrs. Doria.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went down to John&rsquo;s mother, and consulted with her on the propriety of
      the scheme of wedding her daughter to John in accordance with his
      proposition. Mrs. Todhunter&rsquo;s jealousy of any disturbing force in the
      influence she held over her son Mrs. Doria knew to be one of the causes of
      John&rsquo;s remaining constant to the impression she had afore-time produced on
      him. She spoke so kindly of John, and laid so much stress on the ingrained
      obedience and passive disposition of her daughter, that Mrs. Todhunter was
      led to admit she did think it almost time John should be seeking a mate,
      and that he&mdash;all things considered&mdash;would hardly find a fitter
      one. And this, John Todhunter&mdash;old John no more&mdash;heard to his
      amazement when, a day or two subsequently, he instanced the probable
      disapproval of his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The match was arranged. Mrs. Doria did the wooing. It consisted in telling
      Clare that she had come to years when marriage was desirable, and that she
      had fallen into habits of moping which might have the worse effect on her
      future life, as it had on her present health and appearance, and which a
      husband would cure. Richard was told by Mrs. Doria that Clare had
      instantaneously consented to accept Mr. John Todhunter as lord of her
      days, and with more than obedience&mdash;with alacrity. At all events,
      when Richard spoke to Clare, the strange passive creature did not admit
      constraint on her inclinations. Mrs. Doria allowed Richard to speak to
      her. She laughed at his futile endeavours to undo her work, and the boyish
      sentiments he uttered on the subject. &ldquo;Let us see, child,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;let
      us see which turns out the best; a marriage of passion, or a marriage of
      common sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heroic efforts were not wanting to arrest the union. Richard made repeated
      journeys to Hounslow, where Ralph was quartered, and if Ralph could have
      been persuaded to carry off a young lady who did not love him, from the
      bridegroom her mother averred she did love, Mrs. Doria might have been
      defeated. But Ralph in his cavalry quarters was cooler than Ralph in the
      Bursley meadows. &ldquo;Women are oddities, Dick,&rdquo; he remarked, running a finger
      right and left along his upper lip. &ldquo;Best leave them to their own freaks.
      She&rsquo;s a dear girl, though she doesn&rsquo;t talk: I like her for that. If she
      cared for me I&rsquo;d go the race. She never did. It&rsquo;s no use asking a girl
      twice. She knows whether she cares a fig for a fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hero quitted him with some contempt, As Ralph Morton was a young man,
      and he had determined that John Todhunter was an old man, he sought
      another private interview with Clare, and getting her alone, said: &ldquo;Clare,
      I&rsquo;ve come to you for the last time. Will you marry Ralph Morton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To which Clare replied, &ldquo;I cannot marry two husbands, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you refuse to marry this old man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must do as mama wishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re going to marry an old man&mdash;a man you don&rsquo;t love, and
      can&rsquo;t love! Oh, good God! do you know what you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; He flung about
      in a fury. &ldquo;Do you know what it is? Clare!&rdquo; he caught her two hands
      violently, &ldquo;have you any idea of the horror you&rsquo;re going to commit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrank a little at his vehemence, but neither blushed nor stammered:
      answering: &ldquo;I see nothing wrong in doing what mama thinks right, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother! I tell you it&rsquo;s an infamy, Clare! It&rsquo;s a miserable sin! I
      tell you, if I had done such a thing I would not live an hour after it.
      And coldly to prepare for it! to be busy about your dresses! They told me
      when I came in that you were with the milliner. To be smiling over the
      horrible outrage! decorating yourself!&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Richard,&rdquo; said Clare, &ldquo;you will make me very unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That one of my blood should be so debased!&rdquo; he cried, brushing angrily at
      his face. &ldquo;Unhappy! I beg you to feel for yourself, Clare. But I suppose,&rdquo;
       and he said it scornfully, &ldquo;girls don&rsquo;t feel this sort of shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She grew a trifle paler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next to mama, I would wish to please you, dear Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no will of your own?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him softly; a look he interpreted for the meekness he
      detested in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I believe you have none!&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;And what can I do? I can&rsquo;t step
      forward and stop this accursed marriage. If you would but say a word I
      would save you; but you tie my hands. And they expect me to stand by and
      see it done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not be there, Richard?&rdquo; said Clare, following the question with
      her soft eyes. It was the same voice that had so thrilled him on his
      marriage morn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my darling Clare!&rdquo; he cried in the kindest way he had ever used to
      her, &ldquo;if you knew how I feel this!&rdquo; and now as he wept she wept, and came
      insensibly into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling Clare!&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing, but seemed to shudder, weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do it, Clare? You will be sacrificed? So lovely as you are,
      too!... Clare! you cannot be quite blind. If I dared speak to you, and
      tell you all.... Look up. Can you still consent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must not disobey mama,&rdquo; Clare murmured, without looking up from the
      nest her cheek had made on his bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then kiss me for the last time,&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never kiss you after
      it, Clare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent his head to meet her mouth, and she threw her arms wildly round
      him, and kissed him convulsively, and clung to his lips, shutting her
      eyes, her face suffused with a burning red.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he left her, unaware of the meaning of those passionate kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Argument with Mrs. Doria was like firing paper-pellets against a stone
      wall. To her indeed the young married hero spoke almost indecorously, and
      that which his delicacy withheld him from speaking to Clare. He could
      provoke nothing more responsive from the practical animal than &ldquo;Pooh-pooh!
      Tush, tush! and Fiddlededee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; Mrs. Doria said to her intimates, &ldquo;that boy&rsquo;s education acts
      like a disease on him. He cannot regard anything sensibly. He is for ever
      in some mad excess of his fancy, and what he will come to at last heaven
      only knows! I sincerely pray that Austin will be able to bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Threats of prayer, however, that harp upon their sincerity, are not very
      well worth having. Mrs. Doria had embarked in a practical controversy, as
      it were, with her brother. Doubtless she did trust he would be able to
      bear his sorrows to come, but one who has uttered prophecy can barely help
      hoping to see it fulfilled: she had prophecied much grief to the baronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor John Todhunter, who would rather have married the mother, and had
      none of your heroic notions about the sacred necessity for love in
      marriage, moved as one guiltless of offence, and deserving his happiness.
      Mrs. Doria shielded him from the hero. To see him smile at Clare&rsquo;s
      obedient figure, and try not to look paternal, was touching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Clare&rsquo;s marriage served one purpose. It completely occupied
      Richard&rsquo;s mind, and prevented him from chafing at the vexation of not
      finding his father ready to meet him when he came to town. A letter had
      awaited Adrian at the hotel, which said, &ldquo;Detain him till you hear further
      from me. Take him about with you into every form of society.&rdquo; No more than
      that. Adrian had to extemporize, that the baronet had gone down to Wales
      on pressing business, and would be back in a week or so. For ulterior
      inventions and devices wherewith to keep the young gentleman in town, he
      applied to Mrs. Doria. &ldquo;Leave him to me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Doria, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll manage
      him.&rdquo; And she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can say,&rdquo; asks The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip, &ldquo;when he is not walking a puppet
      to some woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doria would hear no good of Lucy. &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; she observed, as
      Adrian ventured a shrugging protest in her behalf,&mdash;&ldquo;it is my firm
      opinion, that a scullery-maid would turn any of you men round her little
      finger&mdash;only give her time and opportunity.&rdquo; By dwelling on the arts
      of women, she reconciled it to her conscience to do her best to divide the
      young husband from his wife till it pleased his father they should live
      their unhallowed union again. Without compunction, or a sense of
      incongruity, she abused her brother and assisted the fulfilment of his
      behests.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the puppets were marshalled by Mrs. Doria, happy, or sad, or
      indifferent. Quite against his set resolve and the tide of his feelings,
      Richard found himself standing behind Clare in the church&mdash;the very
      edifice that had witnessed his own marriage, and heard, &ldquo;I, Clare Doria,
      take thee John Pemberton,&rdquo; clearly pronounced. He stood with black brows
      dissecting the arts of the tailor and hairdresser on unconscious John. The
      back, and much of the middle, of Mr. Todhunter&rsquo;s head was bald; the back
      shone like an egg-shell, but across the middle the artist had drawn two
      long dabs of hair from the sides, and plastered them cunningly, so that
      all save wilful eyes would have acknowledged the head to be covered. The
      man&rsquo;s only pretension was to a respectable juvenility. He had a good
      chest, stout limbs, a face inclined to be jolly. Mrs. Doria had no cause
      to be put out of countenance at all by the exterior of her son-in-law: nor
      was she. Her splendid hair and gratified smile made a light in the church.
      Playing puppets must be an immense pleasure to the practical animal. The
      Forey bridesmaids, five in number, and one Miss Doria, their cousin, stood
      as girls do stand at these sacrifices, whether happy, sad, or indifferent;
      a smile on their lips and tears in attendance. Old Mrs. Todhunter, an
      exceedingly small ancient woman, was also there. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have my boy John
      married without seeing it done,&rdquo; she said, and throughout the ceremony she
      was muttering audible encomiums on her John&rsquo;s manly behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ring was affixed to Clare&rsquo;s finger; there was no ring lost in this
      common-sense marriage. The instant the clergyman bade him employ it, John
      drew the ring out, and dropped it on the finger of the cold passive hand
      in a businesslike way, as one who had studied the matter. Mrs. Doria
      glanced aside at Richard. Richard observed Clare spread out her fingers
      that the operation might be the more easily effected.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did duty in the vestry a few minutes, and then said to his aunt:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come to the breakfast, child? The Foreys&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He cut her short. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stood for the family, and I&rsquo;ll do no more. I won&rsquo;t
      pretend to eat and make merry over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had attained her object and she wisely gave way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well. Go and kiss Clare, and shake his hand. Pray, pray be civil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to Adrian, and said: &ldquo;He is going. You must go with him, and
      find some means of keeping him, or he&rsquo;ll be running off to that woman.
      Now, no words&mdash;go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard bade Clare farewell. She put up her mouth to him humbly, but he
      kissed her on the forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not cease to love me,&rdquo; she said in a quavering whisper in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Todhunter stood beaming and endangering the art of the hairdresser
      with his pocket-handkerchief. Now he positively was married, he thought he
      would rather have the daughter than the mother, which is a reverse of the
      order of human thankfulness at a gift of the Gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, my boy!&rdquo; he said heartily, &ldquo;congratulate me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be happy to, if I could,&rdquo; sedately replied the hero, to the
      consternation of those around. Nodding to the bridesmaids and bowing to
      the old lady, he passed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian, who had been behind him, deputed to watch for a possible
      unpleasantness, just hinted to John: &ldquo;You know, poor fellow, he has got
      into a mess with his marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! ah! yes!&rdquo; kindly said John, &ldquo;poor fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the puppets then rolled off to the breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian hurried after Richard in an extremely discontented state of mind.
      Not to be at the breakfast and see the best of the fun, disgusted him.
      However, he remembered that he was a philosopher, and the strong disgust
      he felt was only expressed in concentrated cynicism on every earthly
      matter engendered by the conversation. They walked side by side into
      Kensington Gardens. The hero was mouthing away to himself, talking by
      fits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he faced Adrian, crying: &ldquo;And I might have stopped it! I see it
      now! I might have stopped it by going straight to him, and asking him if
      he dared marry a girl who did not love him. And I never thought of it.
      Good heaven! I feel this miserable affair on my conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; groaned Adrian. &ldquo;An unpleasant cargo for the conscience, that! I
      would rather carry anything on mine than a married couple. Do you purpose
      going to him now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hero soliloquized: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a bad sort of man.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s not a Cavalier,&rdquo; said Adrian, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s why you wonder your
      aunt selected him, no doubt? He&rsquo;s decidedly of the Roundhead type, with
      the Puritan extracted, or inoffensive, if latent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the double infamy!&rdquo; cried Richard, &ldquo;that a man you can&rsquo;t call
      bad, should do this damned thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s hard we can&rsquo;t find a villain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would have listened to me, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to him now, Richard, my son. Go to him now. It&rsquo;s not yet too late. Who
      knows? If he really has a noble elevated superior mind&mdash;though not a
      Cavalier in person, he may be one at heart&mdash;he might, to please you,
      and since you put such stress upon it, abstain...perhaps with some loss of
      dignity, but never mind. And the request might be singular, or seem so,
      but everything has happened before in this world, you know, my dear boy.
      And what an infinite consolation it is for the eccentric, that
      reflection!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hero was impervious to the wise youth. He stared at him as if he were
      but a speck in the universe he visioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was provoking that Richard should be Adrian&rsquo;s best subject for cynical
      pastime, in the extraordinary heterodoxies he started, and his worst in
      the way he took it; and the wise youth, against his will, had to feel as
      conscious of the young man&rsquo;s imaginative mental armour, as he was of his
      muscular physical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same sort of day!&rdquo; mused Richard, looking up. &ldquo;I suppose my father&rsquo;s
      right. We make our own fates, and nature has nothing to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some difference in the trees, though,&rdquo; Richard continued abstractedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Growing bald at the top,&rdquo; said Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you believe that my aunt Helen compared the conduct of that wretched
      slave Clare to Lucy&rsquo;s, who, she had the cruel insolence to say, entangled
      me into marriage?&rdquo; the hero broke out loudly and rapidly. &ldquo;You know&mdash;I
      told you, Adrian&mdash;how I had to threaten and insist, and how she
      pleaded, and implored me to wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! hum!&rdquo; mumbled Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember my telling you?&rdquo; Richard was earnest to hear her exonerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleaded and implored, my dear boy? Oh, no doubt she did. Where&rsquo;s the lass
      that doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call my wife by another name, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The generic title can&rsquo;t be cancelled because of your having married one
      of the body, my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did all she could to persuade me to wait!&rdquo; emphasized Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian shook his head with a deplorable smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, my good Ricky; not all! not all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard bellowed: &ldquo;What more could she have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She could have shaved her head, for instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This happy shaft did stick. With a furious exclamation Richard shot in
      front, Adrian following him; and asking him (merely to have his assumption
      verified), whether he did not think she might have shaved her head? and,
      presuming her to have done so, whether, in candour, he did not think he
      would have waited&mdash;at least till she looked less of a rank lunatic?
    </p>
    <p>
      After a minute or so, the wise youth was but a fly buzzing about Richard&rsquo;s
      head. Three weeks of separation from Lucy, and an excitement deceased,
      caused him to have soft yearnings for the dear lovely home-face. He told
      Adrian it was his intention to go down that night. Adrian immediately
      became serious. He was at a loss what to invent to detain him, beyond the
      stale fiction that his father was coming to-morrow. He rendered homage to
      the genius of woman in these straits. &ldquo;My aunt,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;would have
      the lie ready; and not only that, but she would take care it did its
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture the voice of a cavalier in the Row hailed them, proving
      to be the Honourable Peter Brayder, Lord Mountfalcon&rsquo;s parasite. He
      greeted them very cordially; and Richard, remembering some fun they had in
      the Island, asked him to dine with them; postponing his return till the
      next day. Lucy was his. It was even sweet to dally with the delight of
      seeing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hon. Peter was one who did honour to the body he belonged to. Though
      not so tall as a west of London footman, he was as shapely; and he had a
      power of making his voice insinuating, or arrogant, as it suited the
      exigencies of his profession. He had not a rap of money in the world; yet
      he rode a horse, lived high, expended largely. The world said that the
      Hon. Peter was salaried by his Lordship, and that, in common with that of
      Parasite, he exercised the ancient companion profession. This the world
      said, and still smiled at the Hon. Peter; for he was an engaging fellow,
      and where he went not Lord Mountfalcon would not go.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a quiet little hotel dinner, ordered by Adrian, and made a square
      at the table, Ripton Thompson being the fourth. Richard sent down to his
      office to fetch him, and the two friends shook hands for the first time
      since the great deed had been executed. Deep was the Old Dog&rsquo;s delight to
      hear the praises of his Beauty sounded by such aristocratic lips as the
      Hon. Peter Brayder&rsquo;s. All through the dinner he was throwing out hints and
      small queries to get a fuller account of her; and when the claret had
      circulated, he spoke a word or two himself, and heard the Hon. Peter
      eulogize his taste, and wish him a bride as beautiful; at which Ripton
      blushed, and said, he had no hope of that, and the Hon. Peter assured him
      marriage did not break the mould.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the wine this gentleman took his cigar on the balcony, and found
      occasion to get some conversation with Adrian alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our young friend here&mdash;made it all right with the governor?&rdquo; he
      asked carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; said Adrian. But it struck him that Brayder might be of
      assistance in showing Richard a little of the `society in every form&rsquo; 
      required by his chief&rsquo;s prescript. &ldquo;That is,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;we are not
      yet permitted an interview with the august author of our being, and I have
      rather a difficult post. &lsquo;Tis mine both to keep him here, and also to find
      him the opportunity to measure himself with his fellow-man. In other
      words, his father wants him to see something of life before he enters upon
      housekeeping. Now I am proud to confess that I&rsquo;m hardly equal to the task.
      The demi, or damnedmonde&mdash;if it&rsquo;s that lie wants him to observe&mdash;is
      one that I leave not got the walk to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; laughed Brayder. &ldquo;You do the keeping, I offer to parade the
      demi. I must say, though, it&rsquo;s a queer notion of the old gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the continuation of a philosophic plan,&rdquo; said Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brayder followed the curvings of the whiff of his cigar with his eyes, and
      ejaculated, &ldquo;Infernally philosophic!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Lord Mountfalcon left the island?&rdquo; Adrian inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mount? to tell the truth I don&rsquo;t know where he is. Chasing some light
      craft, I suppose. That&rsquo;s poor Mount&rsquo;s weakness. It&rsquo;s his ruin, poor
      fellow! He&rsquo;s so confoundedly in earnest at the game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to know it by this time, if fame speaks true,&rdquo; remarked Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a baby about women, and always will be,&rdquo; said Brayder. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been
      once or twice wanting to marry them. Now there&rsquo;s a woman&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
      heard of Mrs. Mount? All the world knows her.&mdash;If that woman hadn&rsquo;t
      scandalized.&rdquo;&mdash;The young man joined them, and checked the
      communication. Brayder winked to Adrian, and pitifully indicated the
      presence of an innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A married man, you know,&rdquo; said Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&mdash;we won&rsquo;t shock him,&rdquo; Brayder observed. He appeared to
      study the young man while they talked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Richard was surprised by a visit from his aunt. Mrs. Doria
      took a seat by his side and spoke as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear nephew. Now you know I have always loved you, and thought of your
      welfare as if you had been my own child. More than that, I fear. Well,
      now, you are thinking of returning to&mdash;to that place&mdash;are you
      not? Yes. It is as I thought. Very well now, let me speak to you. You are
      in a much more dangerous position than you imagine. I don&rsquo;t deny your
      father&rsquo;s affection for you. It would be absurd to deny it. But you are of
      an age now to appreciate his character. Whatever you may do he will always
      give you money. That you are sure of; that you know. Very well. But you
      are one to want more than money: you want his love. Richard, I am
      convinced you will never be happy, whatever base pleasures you may be led
      into, if he should withhold his love from you. Now, child, you know you
      have grievously offended him. I wish not to animadvert on your conduct.&mdash;You
      fancied yourself in love, and so on, and you were rash. The less said of
      it the better now. But you must now&mdash;it is your duty now to do
      something&mdash;to do everything that lies in your power to show him you
      repent. No interruptions! Listen to me. You must consider him. Austin is
      not like other men. Austin requires the most delicate management. You must&mdash;whether
      you feel it or no&mdash;present an appearance of contrition. I counsel it
      for the good of all. He is just like a woman, and where his feelings are
      offended he wants utter subservience. He has you in town, and he does not
      see you:&mdash;now you know that he and I are not in communication: we
      have likewise our differences:&mdash;Well, he has you in town, and he
      holds aloof:&mdash;he is trying you, my dear Richard. No: he is not at
      Raynham: I do not know where he is. He is trying you, child, and you must
      be patient. You must convince him that you do not care utterly for your
      own gratification. If this person&mdash;I wish to speak of her with
      respect, for your sake&mdash;well, if she loves you at all&mdash;if, I
      say, she loves you one atom, she will repeat my solicitations for you to
      stay and patiently wait here till he consents to see you. I tell you
      candidly, it&rsquo;s your only chance of ever getting him to receive her. That
      you should know. And now, Richard, I may add that there is something else
      you should know. You should know that it depends entirely upon your
      conduct now, whether you are to see your father&rsquo;s heart for ever divided
      from you, and a new family at Raynham. You do not understand? I will
      explain. Brothers and sisters are excellent things for young people, but a
      new brood of them can hardly be acceptable to a young man. In fact, they
      are, and must be, aliens. I only tell you what I have heard on good
      authority. Don&rsquo;t you understand now? Foolish boy! if you do not humour
      him, he will marry her. Oh! I am sure of it. I know it. And this you will
      drive him to. I do not warn you on the score of your prospects, but of
      your feelings. I should regard such a contingency, Richard, as a final
      division between you. Think of the scandal! but alas, that is the least of
      the evils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Mrs. Doria&rsquo;s object to produce an impression, and avoid an
      argument. She therefore left him as soon as she had, as she supposed, made
      her mark on the young man. Richard was very silent during the speech, and
      save for an exclamation or so, had listened attentively. He pondered on
      what his aunt said. He loved Lady Blandish, and yet he did not wish to see
      her Lady Feverel. Mrs. Doria laid painful stress on the scandal, and
      though he did not give his mind to this, he thought of it. He thought of
      his mother. Where was she? But most his thoughts recurred to his father,
      and something akin to jealousy slowly awakened his heart to him. He had
      given him up, and had not latterly felt extremely filial; but he could not
      bear the idea of a division in the love of which he had ever been the idol
      and sole object. And such a man, too! so good! so generous! If it was
      jealousy that roused the young man&rsquo;s heart to his father, the better part
      of love was also revived in it. He thought of old days: of his father&rsquo;s
      forbearance, his own wilfulness. He looked on himself, and what he had
      done, with the eyes of such a man. He determined to do all he could to
      regain his favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doria learnt from Adrian in the evening that her nephew intended
      waiting in town another week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; smiled Mrs. Doria. &ldquo;He will be more patient at the end of
      a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! does patience beget patience?&rdquo; said Adrian. &ldquo;I was not aware it was a
      propagating virtue. I surrender him to you. I shan&rsquo;t be able to hold him
      in after one week more. I assure you, my dear aunt, he&rsquo;s already&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, no explanation,&rdquo; Mrs. Doria begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Richard saw her nest, he was informed that she had received a most
      satisfactory letter from Mrs. John Todhunter: quite a glowing account of
      John&rsquo;s behaviour: but on Richard&rsquo;s desiring to know the words Clare had
      written, Mrs. Doria objected to be explicit, and shot into worldly gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clare seldom glows,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I mean for her,&rdquo; his aunt remarked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look like your father,
      child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to have seen the letter,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doria did not propose to show it.

      CHAPTER XXXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      A Lady driving a pair of greys was noticed by Richard in his rides and
      walks. She passed him rather obviously and often. She was very handsome; a
      bold beauty, with shining black hair, red lips, and eyes not afraid of
      men. The hair was brushed from her temples, leaving one of those fine
      reckless outlines which the action of driving, and the pace, admirably set
      off. She took his fancy. He liked the air of petulant gallantry about her,
      and mused upon the picture, rare to him, of a glorious dashing woman. He
      thought, too, she looked at him. He was not at the time inclined to be
      vain, or he might have been sure she did. Once it struck him she nodded
      slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked Adrian one day in the park&mdash;who she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know her,&rdquo; said Adrian. &ldquo;Probably a superior priestess of
      Paphos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s my idea of Bellona,&rdquo; Richard exclaimed. &ldquo;Not the fury they
      paint, but a spirited, dauntless, eager-looking creature like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bellona?&rdquo; returned the wise youth. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think her hair was black.
      Red, wasn&rsquo;t it? I shouldn&rsquo;t compare her to Bellona; though, no doubt,
      she&rsquo;s as ready to spill blood. Look at her! She does seem to scent
      carnage. I see your idea. No; I should liken her to Diana emerged from the
      tutorship of Master Endymion, and at nice play among the gods. Depend upon
      it&mdash;they tell us nothing of the matter&mdash;Olympus shrouds the
      story&mdash;but you may be certain that when she left the pretty shepherd
      she had greater vogue than Venus up aloft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brayder joined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See Mrs. Mount go by?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s Mrs. Mount!&rdquo; cried Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Mrs. Mount?&rdquo; Richard inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sister to Miss Random, my dear boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like to know her?&rdquo; drawled the Hon. Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard replied indifferently, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Mrs. Mount passed out of sight
      and out of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man wrote submissive letters to his father. &ldquo;I have remained
      here waiting to see you now five weeks,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;I have written to you
      three letters, and you do not reply to them. Let me tell you again how
      sincerely I desire and pray that you will come, or permit me to come to
      you and throw myself at your feet, and beg my forgiveness, and hers. She
      as earnestly implores it. Indeed, I am very wretched, sir. Believe me,
      there is nothing I would not do to regain your esteem and the love I fear
      I have unhappily forfeited. I will remain another week in the hope of
      hearing from you, or seeing you. I beg of you, sir, not to drive me mad.
      Whatever you ask of me I will consent to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing he would not do!&rdquo; the baronet commented as he read. &ldquo;There is
      nothing he would not do! He will remain another week and give me that
      final chance! And it is I who drive him mad! Already he is beginning to
      cast his retribution on my shoulders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin had really gone down to Wales to be out of the way. A
      Shaddock-Dogmatist does not meet misfortune without hearing of it, and the
      author of The Pilgrim&rsquo;S Scrip in trouble found London too hot for him. He
      quitted London to take refuge among the mountains; living there in
      solitary commune with a virgin Note-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some indefinite scheme was in his head in this treatment of his son. Had
      he construed it, it would have looked ugly; and it settled to a vague
      principle that the young man should be tried and tested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him learn to deny himself something. Let him live with his equals for
      a term. If he loves me he will read my wishes.&rdquo; Thus he explained his
      principle to Lady Blandish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady wrote: &ldquo;You speak of a term. Till when? May I name one to him? It
      is the dreadful uncertainty that reduces him to despair. That, and nothing
      else. Pray be explicit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In return, he distantly indicated Richard&rsquo;s majority.
    </p>
    <p>
      How could Lady Blandish go and ask the young man to wait a year away from
      his wife? Her instinct began to open a wide eye on the idol she
      worshipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      When people do not themselves know what they mean, they succeed in
      deceiving and imposing upon others. Not only was Lady Blandish mystified;
      Mrs. Doria, who pierced into the recesses of everybody&rsquo;s mind, and had
      always been in the habit of reading off her brother from infancy, and had
      never known herself to be once wrong about him, she confessed she was
      quite at a loss to comprehend Austin&rsquo;s principle. &ldquo;For principle he has,&rdquo;
       said Mrs. Doria; &ldquo;he never acts without one. But what it is, I cannot at
      present perceive. If he would write, and command the boy to await his
      return, all would be clear. He allows us to go and fetch him, and then
      leaves us all in a quandary. It must be some woman&rsquo;s influence. That is
      the only way to account for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Singular!&rdquo; interjected Adrian, &ldquo;what pride women have in their sex! Well,
      I have to tell you, my dear aunt, that the day after to-morrow I hand my
      charge over to your keeping. I can&rsquo;t hold him in an hour longer. I&rsquo;ve had
      to leash him with lies till my invention&rsquo;s exhausted. I petition to have
      them put down to the chief&rsquo;s account, but when the stream runs dry I can
      do no more. The last was, that I had heard from him desiring me to have
      the South-west bedroom ready for him on Tuesday proximate. &lsquo;So!&rsquo; says my
      son, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll wait till then,&rsquo; and from the gigantic effort he exhibited in
      coming to it, I doubt any human power&rsquo;s getting him to wait longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must, we must detain him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Doria. &ldquo;If we do not, I am
      convinced Austin will do something rash that he will for ever repent. He
      will marry that woman, Adrian. Mark my words. Now with any other young
      man!... But Richard&rsquo;s education! that ridiculous System!... Has he no
      distraction? nothing to amuse him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy! I suppose he wants his own particular playfellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wise youth had to bow to a reproof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, Adrian, he will marry that woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear aunt! Can a chaste man do aught more commendable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has the boy no object we can induce him to follow?&mdash;If he had but a
      profession!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What say you to the regeneration of the streets of London, and the
      profession of moral-scavenger, aunt? I assure you I have served a month&rsquo;s
      apprenticeship with him. We sally forth on the tenth hour of the night. A
      female passes. I hear him groan. &lsquo;Is she one of them, Adrian?&rsquo; I am
      compelled to admit she is not the saint he deems it the portion of every
      creature wearing petticoats to be. Another groan; an evident internal, &lsquo;It
      cannot be&mdash;and yet!&rsquo;...that we hear on the stage. Rollings of eyes:
      impious questionings of the Creator of the universe; savage mutterings
      against brutal males; and then we meet a second young person, and repeat
      the performance&mdash;of which I am rather tired. It would be all very
      well, but he turns upon me, and lectures me because I don&rsquo;t hire a house,
      and furnish it for all the women one meets to live in in purity. Now
      that&rsquo;s too much to ask of a quiet man. Master Thompson has latterly
      relieved me, I&rsquo;m happy to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doria thought her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Austin written to you since you were in town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not an Aphorism!&rdquo; returned Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must see Richard to-morrow morning,&rdquo; Mrs. Doria ended the colloquy by
      saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of her interview with her nephew was, that Richard made no
      allusion to a departure on the Tuesday; and for many days afterward he
      appeared to have an absorbing business on his hands: but what it was
      Adrian did not then learn, and his admiration of Mrs. Doria&rsquo;s genius for
      management rose to a very high pitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a morning in October they had an early visitor in the person of the
      Hon. Peter, whom they had not seen for a week or more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, flourishing his cane in his most affable manner,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to propose to you to join us in a little dinner-party at
      Richmond. Nobody&rsquo;s in town, you know. London&rsquo;s as dead as a stock-fish.
      Nothing but the scrapings to offer you. But the weather&rsquo;s fine: I flatter
      myself you&rsquo;ll find the company agreeable, What says my friend Feverel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard begged to be excused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no: positively you must come,&rdquo; said the Hon. Peter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had some
      trouble to get them together to relieve the dulness of your incarceration.
      Richmond&rsquo;s within the rules of your prison. You can be back by night.
      Moonlight on the water&mdash;lovely woman. We&rsquo;ve engaged a city-barge to
      pull us back. Eight oars&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure it isn&rsquo;t sixteen. Come&mdash;the
      word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian was for going. Richard said he had an appointment with Ripton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in for another rick, you two,&rdquo; said Adrian. &ldquo;Arrange that we go.
      You haven&rsquo;t seen the cockney&rsquo;s Paradise. Abjure Blazes, and taste of
      peace, my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After some persuasion, Richard yawned wearily, and got up, and threw aside
      the care that was on him, saying, &ldquo;Very well. Just as you like. We&rsquo;ll take
      old Rip with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian consulted Brayder&rsquo;s eye at this. The Hon. Peter briskly declared he
      should be delighted to have Feverel&rsquo;s friend, and offered to take them all
      down in his drag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t get a match on to swim there with the tide&mdash;eh,
      Feverel, my boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard replied that he had given up that sort of thing, at which Brayder
      communicated a queer glance to Adrian, and applauded the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richmond was under a still October sun. The pleasant landscape, bathed in
      Autumn, stretched from the foot of the hill to a red horizon haze. The day
      was like none that Richard vividly remembered. It touched no link in the
      chain of his recollection. It was quiet, and belonged to the spirit of the
      season.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian had divined the character of the scrapings they were to meet.
      Brayder introduced them to one or two of the men, hastily and in rather an
      undervoice, as a thing to get over. They made their bow to the first knot
      of ladies they encountered. Propriety was observed strictly, even to
      severity. The general talk was of the weather. Here and there a lady would
      seize a button-hole or any little bit of the habiliments, of the man she
      was addressing; and if it came to her to chide him, she did it with more
      than a forefinger. This, however, was only here and there, and a privilege
      of intimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where ladies are gathered together, the Queen of the assemblage may be
      known by her Court of males. The Queen of the present gathering leaned
      against a corner of the open window, surrounded by a stalwart Court, in
      whom a practised eye would have discerned guardsmen, and Ripton, with a
      sinking of the heart, apprehended lords. They were fine men, offering
      inanimate homage. The trim of their whiskerage, the cut of their coats,
      the high-bred indolence in their aspect, eclipsed Ripton&rsquo;s sense of
      self-esteem. But they kindly looked over him. Occasionally one committed a
      momentary outrage on him with an eye-glass, seeming to cry out in a voice
      of scathing scorn, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; and Ripton got closer to his hero to
      justify his humble pretensions to existence and an identity in the shadow
      of him. Richard gazed about. Heroes do not always know what to say or do;
      and the cold bath before dinner in strange company is one of the
      instances. He had recognized his superb Bellona in the lady by the garden
      window. For Brayder the men had nods and yokes, the ladies a pretty
      playfulness. He was very busy, passing between the groups, chatting,
      laughing, taking the feminine taps he received, and sometimes returning
      them in sly whispers. Adrian sat down and crossed his legs, looking amused
      and benignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose dinner is it?&rdquo; Ripton heard a mignonne beauty ask of a cavalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mount&rsquo;s, I suppose,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he? Why don&rsquo;t he come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An affaire, I fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is again! How shamefully he treats Mrs. Mount!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She don&rsquo;t seem to cry over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mount was flashing her teeth and eyes with laughter at one of her
      Court, who appeared to be Fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was announced. The ladies proclaimed extravagant appetites. Brayder
      posted his three friends. Ripton found himself under the lee of a dame
      with a bosom. On the other aide of him was the mignonne. Adrian was at the
      lower end of the table. Ladies were in profusion, and he had his share.
      Brayder drew Richard from seat to seat. A happy man had established
      himself next to Mrs. Mount. Him Brayder hailed to take the head of the
      table. The happy man objected, Brayder continued urgent, the lady tenderly
      insisted, the happy man grimaced, dropped into the post of honour, strove
      to look placable. Richard usurped his chair, and was not badly welcomed by
      his neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the dinner commenced, and had all the attention of the company, till
      the flying of the first champagne-cork gave the signal, and a hum began to
      spread. Sparkling wine, that looseneth the tongue, and displayeth the
      verity, hath also the quality of colouring it. The ladies laughed high;
      Richard only thought them gay and natural. They flung back in their chairs
      and laughed to tears; Ripton thought only of the pleasure he had in their
      society. The champagne-corks continued a regular file-firing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been lately? I haven&rsquo;t seen you in the park,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Mount to Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not been there.&rdquo; The question seemed odd: she
      spoke so simply that it did not impress him. He emptied his glass, and had
      it filled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hon. Peter did most of the open talking, which related to horses,
      yachting, opera, and sport generally: who was ruined; by what horse, or by
      what woman. He told one or two of Richard&rsquo;s feats. Fair smiles rewarded
      the hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you bet?&rdquo; said Mrs. Mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only on myself,&rdquo; returned Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; cried his Bellona, and her eye sent a lingering delirious sparkle
      across her brimming glass at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re a safe one to back,&rdquo; she added, and seemed to scan his
      points approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard&rsquo;s cheeks mounted bloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you adore champagne?&rdquo; quoth the dame with a bosom to Ripton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; answered Ripton, with more candour than accuracy, &ldquo;I always
      drink it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you indeed?&rdquo; said the enraptured bosom, ogling him. &ldquo;You would be a
      friend, now! I hope you don&rsquo;t object to a lady joining you now and then.
      Champagne&rsquo;s my folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A laugh was circling among the ladies of whom Adrian was the centre; first
      low, and as he continued some narration, peals resounded, till those
      excluded from the fun demanded the cue, and ladies leaned behind gentlemen
      to take it up, and formed an electric chain of laughter. Each one, as her
      ear received it, caught up her handkerchief, and laughed, and looked
      shocked afterwards, or looked shocked and then spouted laughter. The
      anecdote might have been communicated to the bewildered cavaliers, but
      coming to a lady of a demurer cast, she looked shocked without laughing,
      and reproved the female table, in whose breasts it was consigned to
      burial: but here and there a man&rsquo;s head was seen bent, and a lady&rsquo;s mouth
      moved, though her face was not turned toward him, and a man&rsquo;s broad laugh
      was presently heard, while the lady gazed unconsciously before her, and
      preserved her gravity if she could escape any other lady&rsquo;s eyes; failing
      in which, handkerchiefs were simultaneously seized, and a second chime
      arose, till the tickling force subsided to a few chance bursts.
    </p>
    <p>
      What nonsense it is that my father writes about women! thought Richard. He
      says they can&rsquo;t laugh, and don&rsquo;t understand humour. It comes, he
      reflected, of his shutting himself from the world. And the idea that he
      was seeing the world, and feeling wiser, flattered him. He talked fluently
      to his dangerous Bellona. He gave her some reminiscences of Adrian&rsquo;s
      whimsies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s your tutor, is it!&rdquo; She eyed the young man as if
      she thought he must go far and fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton felt a push. &ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; said the bosom, fuming utter disgust.
      He was directed to see a manly arm round the waist of the mignonne. &ldquo;Now
      that&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t like in company,&rdquo; the bosom inflated to observe with
      sufficient emphasis. &ldquo;She always will allow it with everybody. Give her a
      nudge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton protested that he dared not; upon which she said, &ldquo;Then I will&rdquo;;
      and inclined her sumptuous bust across his lap, breathing wine in his
      face, and gave the nudge. The mignonne turned an inquiring eye on Ripton;
      a mischievous spark shot from it. She laughed, and said; &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you
      satisfied with the old girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impudence!&rdquo; muttered the bosom, growing grander and redder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do, do fill her glass, and keep her quiet&mdash;she drinks port when
      there&rsquo;s no more champagne,&rdquo; said the mignonne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bosom revenged herself by whispering to Ripton scandal of the
      mignonne, and between them he was enabled to form a correcter estimate of
      the company, and quite recovered from his original awe: so much so as to
      feel a touch of jealousy at seeing his lively little neighbour still held
      in absolute possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mount did not come out much; but there was a deferential manner in
      the bearing of the men toward her, which those haughty creatures accord
      not save to clever women; and she contrived to hold the talk with three or
      four at the head of the table while she still had passages aside with
      Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The port and claret went very well after the champagne. The ladies here
      did not ignominiously surrender the field to the gentlemen; they
      maintained their position with honour. Silver was seen far out on Thames.
      The wine ebbed, and the laughter. Sentiment and cigars took up the
      wondrous tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a lovely night!&rdquo; said the ladies, looking above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charming,&rdquo; said the gentlemen, looking below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faint-smelling cool Autumn air was pleasant after the feast. Fragrant
      weeds burned bright about the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are split into couples,&rdquo; said Adrian to Richard, who was standing
      alone, eying the landscape. &ldquo;Tis the influence of the moon! Apparently we
      are in Cyprus. How has my son enjoyed himself? How likes he the society of
      Aspasia? I feel like a wise Greek to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian was jolly, and rolled comfortably as he talked. Ripton had been
      carried off by the sentimental bosom. He came up to them and whispered:
      &ldquo;By Jove, Ricky! do you know what sort of women these are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard said he thought them a nice sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Puritan!&rdquo; exclaimed Adrian, slapping Ripton on the back. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you
      get tipsy, sir? Don&rsquo;t you ever intoxicate yourself except at lawful
      marriages? Reveal to us what you have done with the portly dame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton endured his bantering that he might hang about Richard, and watch
      over him. He was jealous of his innocent Beauty&rsquo;s husband being in
      proximity with such women. Murmuring couples passed them to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, Ricky!&rdquo; Ripton favoured his friend with another hard whisper,
      &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a woman smoking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not, O Riptonus?&rdquo; said Adrian. &ldquo;Art unaware that woman
      cosmopolitan is woman consummate? and dost grumble to pay the small price
      for the splendid gem?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t like women to smoke,&rdquo; said plain Ripton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why mayn&rsquo;t they do what men do?&rdquo; the hero cried impetuously. &ldquo;I hate that
      contemptible narrow-mindedness. It&rsquo;s that makes the ruin and horrors I
      see. Why mayn&rsquo;t they do what men do? I like the women who are brave enough
      not to be hypocrites. By heaven! if these women are bad, I like them
      better than a set of hypocritical creatures who are all show, and deceive
      you in the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; shouted Adrian. &ldquo;There speaks the regenerator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton, as usual, was crushed by his leader. He had no argument. He still
      thought women ought not to smoke; and he thought of one far away, lonely
      by the sea, who was perfect without being cosmopolitan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Scrip remarks that: &ldquo;Young men take joy in nothing so much
      as the thinking women Angels: and nothing sours men of experience more
      than knowing that all are not quite so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Aphorist would have pardoned Ripton Thompson his first Random
      extravagance, had he perceived the simple warm-hearted worship of feminine
      goodness Richard&rsquo;s young bride had inspired in the breast of the youth. It
      might possibly have taught him to put deeper trust in our nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton thought of her, and had a feeling of sadness. He wandered about the
      grounds by himself, went through an open postern, and threw himself down
      among some bushes on the slope of the hill. Lying there, and meditating,
      he became aware of voices conversing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he want?&rdquo; said a woman&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s another of his villanies,
      I know. Upon my honour, Brayder, when I think of what I have to reproach
      him for, I think I must go mad, or kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tragic!&rdquo; said the Hon. Peter. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you revenged yourself, Bella,
      pretty often? Best deal openly. This is a commercial transaction. You ask
      for money, and you are to have it&mdash;on the conditions: double the sum,
      and debts paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He applies to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, my dear Bella, it has long been all up between you. I think
      Mount has behaved very well, considering all he knows. He&rsquo;s not easily
      hoodwinked, you know. He resigns himself to his fate and follows other
      game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the condition is, that I am to seduce this young man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Bella! you strike your bird like a hawk. I didn&rsquo;t say seduce.
      Hold him in&mdash;play with him. Amuse him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand half-measures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women seldom do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I hate you, Brayder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank your ladyship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two walked farther. Ripton had heard some little of the colloquy. He
      left the spot in a serious mood, apprehensive of something dark to the
      people he loved, though he had no idea of what the Hon. Peter&rsquo;s
      stipulation involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the voyage back to town, Richard was again selected to sit by Mrs.
      Mount. Brayder and Adrian started the jokes. The pair of parasites got on
      extremely well together. Soft fell the plash of the oars; softly the
      moonlight curled around them; softly the banks glided by. The ladies were
      in a state of high sentiment. They sang without request. All deemed the
      British ballad-monger an appropriate interpreter of their emotions. After
      good wine, and plenty thereof, fair throats will make men of taste swallow
      that remarkable composer. Eyes, lips, hearts; darts and smarts and sighs;
      beauty, duty; bosom, blossom; false one, farewell! To this pathetic strain
      they melted. Mrs. Mount, though strongly requested, declined to sing. She
      preserved her state. Under the tall aspens of Brentford-ait, and on they
      swept, the white moon in their wake. Richard&rsquo;s hand lay open by his side.
      Mrs. Mount&rsquo;s little white hand by misadventure fell into it. It was not
      pressed, or soothed for its fall, or made intimate with eloquent fingers.
      It lay there like a bit of snow on the cold ground. A yellow leaf wavering
      down from the aspens struck Richard&rsquo;s cheek, and he drew away the very
      hand to throw back his hair and smooth his face, and then folded his arms,
      unconscious of offence. He was thinking ambitiously of his life: his blood
      was untroubled, his brain calmly working.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is the more perilous?&rdquo; is a problem put by the Pilgrim: &ldquo;To meet
      the temptings of Eve, or to pique her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mount stared at the young man as at a curiosity, and turned to flirt
      with one of her Court. The Guardsmen were mostly sentimental. One or two
      rattled, and one was such a good-humoured fellow that Adrian could not
      make him ridiculous. The others seemed to give themselves up to a silent
      waxing in length of limb. However far they sat removed, everybody was
      entangled in their legs. Pursuing his studies, Adrian came to the
      conclusion, that the same close intellectual and moral affinity which he
      had discovered to exist between our nobility and our yeomanry, is to be
      observed between the Guardsman class, and that of the corps de ballet:
      they both live by the strength of their legs, where also their wits, if
      they do not altogether reside there, are principally developed: both are
      volage; wine, tobacco, and the moon, influence both alike; and admitting
      the one marked difference that does exist, it is, after all, pretty nearly
      the same thing to be coquetting and sinning on two legs as on the point of
      a toe.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long Guardsman with a deep bass voice sang a doleful song about the
      twining tendrils of the heart ruthlessly torn, but required urgent
      persuasions and heavy trumpeting of his lungs to get to the end: before he
      had accomplished it, Adrian had contrived to raise a laugh in his
      neighbourhood, so that the company was divided, and the camp split:
      jollity returned to one-half, while sentiment held the other. Ripton,
      blotted behind the bosom, was only lucky in securing a higher degree of
      heat than was possible for the rest. &ldquo;Are you cold?&rdquo; she would ask,
      smiling charitably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said the mignonne, as if to excuse her conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You always appear to be,&rdquo; the fat one sniffed and snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you warm two, Mrs. Mortimer?&rdquo; said the naughty little woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disdain prevented any further notice of her. Those familiar with the
      ladies enjoyed their sparring, which was frequent. The mignonne was heard
      to whisper: &ldquo;That poor fellow will certainly be stewed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very prettily the ladies took and gave warmth, for the air on the water
      was chill and misty. Adrian had beside him the demure one who had stopped
      the circulation of his anecdote. She in nowise objected to the fair
      exchange, but said &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; betweenwhiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Past Kew and Hammersmith, on the cool smooth water; across Putney reach;
      through Battersea bridge; and the City grew around them, and the shadows
      of great mill-factories slept athwart the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the ladies prattled sweetly of a charming day when they alighted on
      land. Several cavaliers crushed for the honour of conducting Mrs. Mount to
      her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brougham&rsquo;s here; I shall go alone,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mount. &ldquo;Some one arrange
      my shawl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her back to Richard, who had a view of a delicate neck as he
      manipulated with the bearing of a mailed knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which way are you going?&rdquo; she asked carelessly, and, to his reply as to
      the direction, said: &ldquo;Then I can give you a lift,&rdquo; and she took his arm
      with a matter-of-course air, and walked up the stairs with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton saw what had happened. He was going to follow: the portly dame
      retained him, and desired him to get her a cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you happy fellow!&rdquo; said the bright-eyed mignonne, passing by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton procured the cab, and stuffed it full without having to get into it
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try and let him come in too?&rdquo; said the persecuting creature, again
      passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take liberties with pour men&mdash;you shan&rsquo;t with me,&rdquo; retorted the
      angry bosom, and drove off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she&rsquo;s been and gone and run away and left him after all his trouble!&rdquo;
       cried the pert little thing, peering into Ripton&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ll never
      be so foolish as to pin your faith to fat women again. There! he shall be
      made happy another time.&rdquo; She gave his nose a comical tap, and tripped
      away with her possessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton rather forgot his friend for some minutes: Random thoughts laid
      hold of him. Cabs and carriages rattled past. He was sure he had been
      among members of the nobility that day, though when they went by him now
      they only recognized him with an effort of the eyelids. He began to think
      of the day with exultation, as an event. Recollections of the mignonne
      were captivating. &ldquo;Blue eyes&mdash;just what I like! And such a little
      impudent nose, and red lips, pouting&mdash;the very thing I like! And her
      hair? darkish, I think&mdash;say brown. And so saucy, and light on her
      feet. And kind she is, or she wouldn&rsquo;t have talked to me like that.&rdquo; Thus,
      with a groaning soul, he pictured her. His reason voluntarily consigned
      her to the aristocracy as a natural appanage: but he did amorously wish
      that Fortune had made a lord of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his mind reverted to Mrs. Mount, and the strange bits of the
      conversation he had heard on the hill. He was not one to suspect anybody
      positively. He was timid of fixing a suspicion. It hovered indefinitely,
      and clouded people, without stirring him to any resolve. Still the
      attentions of the lady toward Richard were queer. He endeavoured to
      imagine they were in the nature of things, because Richard was so handsome
      that any woman must take to him. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s married,&rdquo; said Ripton, &ldquo;and he
      mustn&rsquo;t go near these people if he&rsquo;s married.&rdquo; Not a high morality,
      perhaps better than none at all: better for the world were it practised
      more. He thought of Richard along with that sparkling dame, alone with
      her. The adorable beauty of his dear bride, her pure heavenly face, swam
      before him. Thinking of her, he lost sight of the mignonne who had made
      him giddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked to Richard&rsquo;s hotel, and up and down the street there, hoping
      every minute to hear his step; sometimes fancying he might have returned
      and gone to bed. Two o&rsquo;clock struck. Ripton could not go away. He was sure
      he should not sleep if he did. At last the cold sent him homeward, and
      leaving the street, on the moonlight side of Piccadilly he met his friend
      patrolling with his head up and that swing of the feet proper to men who
      are chanting verses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Rip!&rdquo; cried Richard, cheerily. &ldquo;What on earth are you doing here at
      this hour of the morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton muttered of his pleasure at meeting him. &ldquo;I wanted to shake your
      hand before I went home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard smiled on him in an amused kindly way. &ldquo;That all? You may shake my
      hand any day, like a true man as you are, old Rip! I&rsquo;ve been speaking
      about you. Do you know, that&mdash;Mrs. Mount&mdash;never saw you all the
      time at Richmond, or in the boat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Ripton said, well assured that he was a dwarf &ldquo;you saw her safe
      home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve been there for the last couple of hours&mdash;talking. She
      talks capitally: she&rsquo;s wonderfully clever. She&rsquo;s very like a man, only
      much nicer. I like her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Richard, excuse me&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t mean to offend you&mdash;but
      now you&rsquo;re married...perhaps you couldn&rsquo;t help seeing her home, but I
      think you really indeed oughtn&rsquo;t to have gone upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton delivered this opinion with a modest impressiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Richard. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose I care for any woman
      but my little darling down there.&rdquo; He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; of course not. That&rsquo;s absurd. What I mean is, that people perhaps
      will&mdash;you know, they do&mdash;they say all manner of things, and that
      makes unhappiness; and I do wish you were going home to-morrow, Ricky. I
      mean, to your dear wife.&rdquo; Ripton blushed and looked away as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hero gave one of his scornful glances. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re anxious about my
      reputation. I hate that way of looking on women. Because they have been
      once misled&mdash;look how much weaker they are!&mdash;because the world
      has given them an ill fame, you would treat them as contagious and keep
      away from them for the sake of your character!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be different with me,&rdquo; quoth Ripton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked the hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m worse than you,&rdquo; was all the logical explanation Ripton was
      capable of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do hope you will go home soon,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;and I, so do I hope so. But I&rsquo;ve work to do now. I
      dare not, I cannot, leave it. Lucy would be the last to ask me;&mdash;you
      saw her letter yesterday. Now listen to me, Rip. I want to make you be
      just to women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he read Ripton a lecture on erring women, speaking of them as if he
      had known them and studied them for years. Clever, beautiful, but betrayed
      by love, it was the first duty of all true men to cherish and redeem them.
      &ldquo;We turn them into curses, Rip; these divine creatures.&rdquo; And the world
      suffered for it. That&mdash;that was the root of all the evil in the
      world!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel anger or horror at these poor women, Rip! It&rsquo;s strange. I
      knew what they were when we came home in the boat. But I do&mdash;it tears
      my heart to see a young girl given over to an old man&mdash;a man she
      doesn&rsquo;t love. That&rsquo;s shame!&mdash;Don&rsquo;t speak of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forgetting to contest the premiss, that all betrayed women are betrayed by
      love, Ripton was quite silenced. He, like most young men, had pondered
      somewhat on this matter, and was inclined to be sentimental when he was
      not hungry. They walked in the moonlight by the railings of the park.
      Richard harangued at leisure, while Ripton&rsquo;s teeth chattered. Chivalry
      might be dead, but still there was something to do, went the strain. The
      lady of the day had not been thrown in the hero&rsquo;s path without an object,
      he said; and he was sadly right there. He did not express the thing
      clearly; nevertheless Ripton understood him to mean, he intended to rescue
      that lady from further transgressions, and show a certain scorn of the
      world. That lady, and then other ladies unknown, were to be rescued.
      Ripton was to help. He and Ripton were to be the knights of this
      enterprise. When appealed to, Ripton acquiesced, and shivered. Not only
      were they to be knights, they would have to be Titans, for the powers of
      the world, the spurious ruling Social Gods, would have to be defied and
      overthrown. And Titan number one flung up his handsome bold face as if to
      challenge base Jove on the spot; and Titan number two strained the upper
      button of his coat to meet across his pocket-handkerchief on his chest,
      and warmed his fingers under his coat-tails. The moon had fallen from her
      high seat and was in the mists of the West, when he was allowed to seek
      his blankets, and the cold acting on his friend&rsquo;s eloquence made Ripton&rsquo;s
      flesh very contrite. The poor fellow had thinner blood than the hero; but
      his heart was good. By the time he had got a little warmth about him, his
      heart gratefully strove to encourage him in the conception of becoming a
      knight and a Titan; and so striving Ripton fell asleep and dreamed.

      CHAPTER XXXVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Behold the hero embarked in the redemption of an erring beautiful woman.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; writes the Pilgrim at this very time to Lady Blandish, &ldquo;I cannot
      get that legend of the Serpent from me, the more I think. Has he not
      caught you, and ranked you foremost in his legions? For see: till you were
      fashioned, the fruits hung immobile on the boughs. They swayed before us,
      glistening and cold. The hand must be eager that plucked them. They did
      not come down to us, and smile, and speak our language, and read our
      thoughts, and know when to fly, when to follow! how surely to have us!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do but mark one of you standing openly in the track of the Serpent. What
      shall be done with her? I fear the world is wiser than its judges! Turn
      from her, says the world. By day the sons of the world do. It darkens, and
      they dance together downward. Then comes there one of the world&rsquo;s elect
      who deems old counsel devilish; indifference to the end of evil worse than
      its pursuit. He comes to reclaim her. From deepest bane will he bring her
      back to highest blessing. Is not that a bait already? Poor fish! &lsquo;tis
      wondrous flattering. The Serpent has slimed her so to secure him! With
      slow weary steps he draws her into light: she clings to him; she is human;
      part of his work, and he loves it. As they mount upward, he looks on her
      more, while she, it may be, looks above. What has touched him? What has
      passed out of her, and into him? The Serpent laughs below. At the gateways
      of the Sun they fall together!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This alliterative production was written without any sense of the peril
      that makes prophecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It suited Sir Austin to write thus. It was a channel to his acrimony
      moderated through his philosophy. The letter was a reply to a vehement
      entreaty from Lady Blandish for him to come up to Richard and forgive him
      thoroughly: Richard&rsquo;s name was not mentioned in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He tries to be more than he is,&rdquo; thought the lady: and she began
      insensibly to conceive him less than he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baronet was conscious of a certain false gratification in his son&rsquo;s
      apparent obedience to his wishes and complete submission; a gratification
      he chose to accept as his due, without dissecting or accounting for it.
      The intelligence reiterating that Richard waited, and still waited;
      Richard&rsquo;s letters, and more his dumb abiding and practical penitence;
      vindicated humanity sufficiently to stop the course of virulent aphorisms.
      He could speak, we have seen, in sorrow for this frail nature of ours,
      that he had once stood forth to champion. &ldquo;But how long will this last?&rdquo;
       he demanded, with the air of Hippias. He did not reflect how long it had
      lasted. Indeed, his indigestion of wrath had made of him a moral Dyspepsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not mere obedience that held Richard from the aims of his young
      wife: nor was it this new knightly enterprise he had presumed to
      undertake. Hero as he was, a youth, open to the insane promptings of hot
      blood, he was not a fool. There had been talk between him and Mrs. Doria
      of his mother. Now that he had broken from his father, his heart spoke for
      her. She lived, he knew: he knew no more. Words painfully hovering along
      the borders of plain speech had been communicated to him, filling him with
      moody imaginings. If he thought of her, the red was on his face, though he
      could not have said why. But now, after canvassing the conduct of his
      father, and throwing him aside as a terrible riddle, he asked Mrs. Doria
      to tell him of his other parent. As softly as she could she told the
      story. To her the shame was past: she could weep for the poor lady.
      Richard dropped no tears. Disgrace of this kind is always present to a
      son, and, educated as he had been, these tidings were a vivid fire in his
      brain. He resolved to hunt her out, and take her from the man. Here was
      work set to his hand. All her dear husband did was right to Lucy. She
      encouraged him to stay for that purpose, thinking it also served another.
      There was Tom Bakewell to watch over Lucy: there was work for him to do.
      Whether it would please his father he did not stop to consider. As to the
      justice of the act, let us say nothing.

      On Ripton devolved the humbler task of grubbing for Sandoe&rsquo;s place of
      residence; and as he was unacquainted with the name by which the poet now
      went in private, his endeavours were not immediately successful. The
      friends met in the evening at Lady Blandish&rsquo;s town-house, or at the
      Foreys&rsquo;, where Mrs. Doria procured the reverer of the Royal Martyr, and
      staunch conservative, a favourable reception. Pity, deep pity for
      Richard&rsquo;s conduct Ripton saw breathing out of Mrs. Doria. Algernon Feverel
      treated his nephew with a sort of rough commiseration, as a young fellow
      who had run off the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pity was in Lady Blandish&rsquo;s eyes, though for a different cause. She
      doubted if she did well in seconding his father&rsquo;s unwise scheme&mdash;supposing
      him to have a scheme. She saw the young husband encompassed by dangers at
      a critical time. Not a word of Mrs. Mount had been breathed to her, but
      the lady had some knowledge of life. She touched on delicate verges to the
      baronet in her letters, and he understood her well enough. &ldquo;If he loves
      this person to whom he has bound himself, what fear for him? Or are you
      coming to think it something that bears the name of love because we have
      to veil the rightful appellation?&rdquo; So he responded, remote among the
      mountains. She tried very hard to speak plainly. Finally he came to say
      that he denied himself the pleasure of seeing his son specially, that he
      for a time might be put to the test the lady seemed to dread. This was
      almost too much for Lady Blandish. Love&rsquo;s charity boy so loftily serene
      now that she saw him half denuded&mdash;a thing of shanks and wrists&mdash;was
      a trial for her true heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going home at night Richard would laugh at the faces made about his
      marriage. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll carry the day, Rip, my Lucy and I! or I&rsquo;ll do it alone&mdash;what
      there is to do.&rdquo; He slightly adverted to a natural want of courage in
      women, which Ripton took to indicate that his Beauty was deficient in that
      quality. Up leapt the Old Dog; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure there never was a braver creature
      upon earth, Richard! She&rsquo;s as brave as she&rsquo;s lovely, I&rsquo;ll swear she is!
      Look how she behaved that day! How her voice sounded! She was trembling...
      Brave? She&rsquo;d follow you into battle, Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Richard rejoined: &ldquo;Talk on, dear old Rip! She&rsquo;s my darling love,
      whatever she is! And she is gloriously lovely. No eyes are like hers. I&rsquo;ll
      go down to-morrow morning the first thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton only wondered the husband of such a treasure could remain apart
      from it. So thought Richard for a space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I go, Rip,&rdquo; he said despondently, &ldquo;if I go for a day even I shall
      have undone all my work with my father. She says it herself&mdash;you saw
      it in her last letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Ripton assented, and the words &ldquo;Please remember me to dear Mr.
      Thompson,&rdquo; fluttered about the Old Dog&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came to pass that Mrs. Berry, having certain business that led her
      through Kensington Gardens, spied a figure that she had once dandled in
      long clothes, and helped make a man of, if ever woman did. He was walking
      under the trees beside a lady, talking to her, not indifferently. The
      gentleman was her bridegroom and her babe. &ldquo;I know his back,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Berry, as if she had branded a mark on it in infancy. But the lady was not
      her bride. Mrs. Berry diverged from the path, and got before them on the
      left flank; she stared, retreated, and came round upon the right. There
      was that in the lady&rsquo;s face which Mrs. Berry did not like. Her innermost
      question was, why he was not walking with his own wife? She stopped in
      front of them. They broke, and passed about her. The lady made a laughing
      remark to him, whereat he turned to look, and Mrs. Berry bobbed. She had
      to bob a second time, and then he remembered the worthy creature, and
      hailed her Penelope, shaking her hand so that he put her in countenance
      again. Mrs. Berry was extremely agitated. He dismissed her, promising to
      call upon her in the evening. She heard the lady slip out something from a
      side of her lip, and they both laughed as she toddled off to a sheltering
      tree to wipe a corner of each eye. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the looks of that woman,&rdquo;
       she said, and repeated it resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t he walk arm-in-arm with her?&rdquo; was her neat inquiry. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
      his wife?&rdquo; succeeded it. After many interrogations of the sort, she
      arrived at naming the lady a bold-faced thing; adding subsequently,
      brazen. The lady had apparently shown Mrs. Berry that she wished to get
      rid of her, and had checked the outpouring of her emotions on the breast
      of her babe. &ldquo;I know a lady when I see one,&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
      lived with &lsquo;em for nothing; and if she&rsquo;s a lady bred and born, I wasn&rsquo;t
      married in the church alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, if not a lady, what was she? Mrs. Berry desired to know: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
      imitation lady, I&rsquo;m sure she is!&rdquo; Berry vowed. &ldquo;I say she don&rsquo;t look
      proper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Establishing the lady to be a spurious article, however, what was one to
      think of a married man in company with such? &ldquo;Oh no! it ain&rsquo;t that!&rdquo; Mrs.
      Berry returned immediately on the charitable tack. &ldquo;Belike it&rsquo;s some one
      of his acquaintance &lsquo;ve married her for her looks, and he&rsquo;ve just met
      her.... Why it&rsquo;d be as bad as my Berry!&rdquo; the relinquished spouse of Berry
      ejaculated, in horror at the idea of a second man being so monstrous in
      wickedness. &ldquo;Just coupled, too!&rdquo; Mrs. Berry groaned on the suspicious side
      of the debate. &ldquo;And such a sweet young thing for his wife! But no, I&rsquo;ll
      never believe it. Not if he tell me so himself! And men don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo;
       she whimpered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women are swift at coming to conclusions in these matters; soft women
      exceedingly swift: and soft women who have been betrayed are rapid beyond
      measure. Mrs. Berry had not cogitated long ere she pronounced distinctly
      and without a shadow of dubiosity: &ldquo;My opinion is&mdash;married or not
      married, and wheresomever he pick her up&mdash;she&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; more nor less
      than a Bella Donna!&rdquo; as which poisonous plant she forthwith registered the
      lady in the botanical note-book of her brain. It would have astonished
      Mrs. Mount to have heard her person so accurately hit off at a glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening Richard made good his promise, accompanied by Ripton. Mrs.
      Berry opened the door to them. She could not wait to get him into the
      parlour. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my own blessed babe; and I&rsquo;m as good as your mother,
      though I didn&rsquo;t suck ye, bein&rsquo; a maid!&rdquo; she cried, falling into his arms,
      while Richard did his best to support the unexpected burden. Then
      reproaching him tenderly for his guile&mdash;at mention of which Ripton
      chuckled, deeming it his own most honourable portion of the plot&mdash;Mrs.
      Berry led them into the parlour, and revealed to Richard who she was, and
      how she had tossed him, and hugged him, and kissed him all over, when he
      was only that big&mdash;showing him her stumpy fat arm. &ldquo;I kissed ye from
      head to tail, I did,&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry, &ldquo;and you needn&rsquo;t be ashamed of it.
      It&rsquo;s be hoped you&rsquo;ll never have nothin&rsquo; worse come t&rsquo;ye, my dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard assured her he was not a bit ashamed, but warned her that she must
      not do it now, Mrs. Berry admitting it was out of the question now, and
      now that he had a wife, moreover. The young men laughed, and Ripton
      laughing over-loudly drew on himself Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s attention: &ldquo;But that Mr.
      Thompson there&mdash;however he can look me in the face after his
      inn&rsquo;cence! helping blindfold an old woman! though I ain&rsquo;t sorry for what I
      did&mdash;that I&rsquo;m free for to say, and its&rsquo; over, and blessed be all!
      Amen! So now where is she and how is she, Mr. Richard, my dear&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      only cuttin&rsquo; off the &lsquo;s&rsquo; and you are as you was.&mdash;Why didn&rsquo;t ye bring
      her with ye to see her old Berry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard hurriedly explained that Lucy was still in the Isle of Wight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! and you&rsquo;ve left her for a day or two?&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! I wish it had been a day or two,&rdquo; cried Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! and how long have it been?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Berry, her heart beginning to
      beat at his manner of speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about it,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you never been dudgeonin&rsquo; already? Oh! you haven&rsquo;t been peckin&rsquo; at
      one another yet?&rdquo; Mrs. Berry exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton interposed to tell her such fears were unfounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how long ha&rsquo; you been divided?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a guilty voice Ripton stammered &ldquo;since September.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;September!&rdquo; breathed Mrs. Berry, counting on her fingers, &ldquo;September,
      October, Nov&mdash;two months and more! nigh three! A young married
      husband away from the wife of his bosom nigh three months! Oh my! Oh my!
      what do that mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father sent for me&mdash;I&rsquo;m waiting to see him,&rdquo; said Richard. A few
      more words helped Mrs. Berry to comprehend the condition of affairs. Then
      Mrs. Berry spread her lap, flattened out her hands, fixed her eyes, and
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young gentleman!&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to call ye my darlin&rsquo; babe! I&rsquo;m
      going to speak as a mother to ye, whether ye likes it or no; and what old
      Berry says, you won&rsquo;t mind, for she&rsquo;s had ye when there was no
      conventionals about ye, and she has the feelin&rsquo;s of a mother to you,
      though humble her state. If there&rsquo;s one that know matrimony it&rsquo;s me, my
      dear, though Berry did give me no more but nine months of it and I&rsquo;ve
      known the worst of matrimony, which, if you wants to be woeful wise, there
      it is for ye. For what have been my gain? That man gave me nothin&rsquo; but his
      name; and Bessy Andrews was as good as Bessy Berry, though both is &lsquo;Bs,&rsquo; 
      and says he, you was &lsquo;A,&rsquo; and now you&rsquo;s &lsquo;B,&rsquo; so you&rsquo;re my A B, he says,
      write yourself down that, he says, the bad man, with his jokes!&mdash;Berry
      went to service.&rdquo; Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s softness came upon her. &ldquo;So I tell ye,
      Berry went to service. He left the wife of his bosom forlorn and he went
      to service; because he were allays an ambitious man, and wasn&rsquo;t, so to
      speak, happy out of his uniform&mdash;which was his livery&mdash;not even
      in my arms: and he let me know it. He got among them kitchen sluts, which
      was my mournin&rsquo; ready made, and worse than a widow&rsquo;s cap to me, which is
      no shame to wear, and some say becoming. There&rsquo;s no man as ever lived
      known better than my Berry how to show his legs to advantage, and gals
      look at &lsquo;em. I don&rsquo;t wonder now that Berry was prostrated. His temptations
      was strong, and his flesh was weak. Then what I say is, that for a young
      married man&mdash;be he whomsoever he may be&mdash;to be separated from
      the wife of his bosom&mdash;a young sweet thing, and he an innocent young
      gentleman!&mdash;so to sunder, in their state, and be kep&rsquo; from each
      other, I say it&rsquo;s as bad as bad can be! For what is matrimony, my dears?
      We&rsquo;re told it&rsquo;s a holy Ordnance. And why are ye so comfortable in
      matrimony? For that ye are not a sinnin&rsquo;! And they that severs ye they
      tempts ye to stray: and you learn too late the meanin&rsquo; o&rsquo; them blessin&rsquo;s
      of the priest&mdash;as it was ordained. Separate&mdash;what comes? Fust
      it&rsquo;s like the circulation of your blood a-stoppin&rsquo;&mdash;all goes wrong.
      Then there&rsquo;s misunderstandings&mdash;ye&rsquo;ve both lost the key. Then, behold
      ye, there&rsquo;s birds o&rsquo; prey hoverin&rsquo; over each on ye, and it&rsquo;s which&rsquo;ll be
      snapped up fust. Then&mdash;Oh, dear! Oh, dear! it be like the devil come
      into the world again.&rdquo; Mrs. Berry struck her hands and moaned. &ldquo;A day I&rsquo;ll
      give ye: I&rsquo;ll go so far as a week: but there&rsquo;s the outside. Three months
      dwellin&rsquo; apart! That&rsquo;s not matrimony, it&rsquo;s divorcin&rsquo;! what can it be to
      her but widowhood? widowhood with no cap to show for it! And what can it
      be to you, my dear? Think! you been a bachelor three months! and a
      bachelor man,&rdquo; Mrs. Berry shook her head most dolefully, &ldquo;he ain&rsquo;t widow
      woman. I don&rsquo;t go to compare you to Berry, my dear young gentleman. Some
      men&rsquo;s hearts is vagabonds born&mdash;they must go astray&mdash;it&rsquo;s their
      natur&rsquo; to. But all men are men, and I know the foundation of &lsquo;em, by
      reason of my woe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry paused. Richard was humorously respectful to the sermon. The
      truth in the good creature&rsquo;s address was not to be disputed, or despised,
      notwithstanding the inclination to laugh provoked by her quaint way of
      putting it. Ripton nodded encouragingly at every sentence, for he saw her
      drift, and wished to second it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeking for an illustration of her meaning, Mrs. Berry solemnly continued:
      &ldquo;We all know what checked prespiration is.&rdquo; But neither of the young
      gentlemen could resist this. Out they burst in a roar of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laugh away,&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind ye. I say again, we all do
      know what checked prespiration is. It fly to the lungs, it gives ye mortal
      inflammation, and it carries ye off. Then I say checked matrimony is as
      bad. It fly to the heart, and it carries off the virtue that&rsquo;s in ye, and
      you might as well be dead! Them that is joined it&rsquo;s their salvation not to
      separate! It don&rsquo;t so much matter before it. That Mr. Thompson there&mdash;if
      he go astray, it ain&rsquo;t from the blessed fold. He hurt himself alone&mdash;not
      double, and belike treble, for who can say now what may be? There&rsquo;s time
      for it. I&rsquo;m for holding back young people so that they knows their minds,
      howsomever they rattles about their hearts. I ain&rsquo;t a speeder of
      matrimony, and good&rsquo;s my reason! but where it&rsquo;s been done&mdash;where
      they&rsquo;re lawfully joined, and their bodies made one, I do say this, that to
      put division between &lsquo;em then, it&rsquo;s to make wanderin&rsquo; comets of &lsquo;em&mdash;creatures
      without a objeck, and no soul can say what they&rsquo;s good for but to rush
      about!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry here took a heavy breath, as one who has said her utmost for
      the time being.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear old girl,&rdquo; Richard went up to her and, applauding her on the
      shoulder, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a very wise old woman. But you mustn&rsquo;t speak to me as if
      I wanted to stop here. I&rsquo;m compelled to. I do it for her good chiefly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your father that&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; it, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m waiting his pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty pleasure! puttin&rsquo; a snake in the nest of young turtle-doves! And
      why don&rsquo;t she come up to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that you must ask her. The fact is, she&rsquo;s a little timid girl&mdash;she
      wants me to see him first, and when I&rsquo;ve made all right, then she&rsquo;ll
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little timid girl!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Berry. &ldquo;Oh, lor&rsquo;, how she must ha&rsquo; 
      deceived ye to make ye think that! Look at that ring,&rdquo; she held out her
      finger, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a stranger: he&rsquo;s not my lawful! You know what ye did to me,
      my dear. Could I get my own wedding-ring back from her? &lsquo;No!&rsquo; says she,
      firm as a rock, &lsquo;he said, with this ring I thee wed&rsquo;&mdash;I think I see
      her now, with her pretty eyes and lovesome locks&mdash;a darlin&rsquo;!&mdash;And
      that ring she&rsquo;d keep to, come life, came death. And she must ha&rsquo; been a
      rock for me to give in to her in that. For what&rsquo;s the consequence? Here am
      I,&rdquo; Mrs. Berry smoothed down the back of her hand mournfully, &ldquo;here am I
      in a strange ring, that&rsquo;s like a strange man holdin&rsquo; of me, and me
      a-wearin&rsquo; of it just to seem decent, and feelin&rsquo; all over no better than a
      b&mdash;a big&mdash;that nasty came I can&rsquo;t abide!&mdash;I tell you, my
      dear, she ain&rsquo;t soft, no!&mdash;except to the man of her heart; and the
      best of women&rsquo;s too soft there&mdash;mores our sorrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said Richard, who thought he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you, Mrs. Berry,&rdquo; Ripton struck in, &ldquo;Mrs. Richard would do
      anything in the world her husband asked her, I&rsquo;m quite sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you for your good opinion, Mr. Thompson! Why, see her! she ain&rsquo;t
      frail on her feet; she looks ye straight in the eyes; she ain&rsquo;t one of
      your hang-down misses. Look how she behaved at the ceremony!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed Ripton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; seen her when she spoke to me about my ring! Depend upon
      it, my dear Mr. Richard, if she blinded you about the nerve she&rsquo;ve got, it
      was somethin&rsquo; she thought she ought to do for your sake, and I wish I&rsquo;d
      been by to counsel her, poor blessed babe!&mdash;And how much longer, now,
      can ye stay divided from that darlin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard paced up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A father&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; urged Mrs. Berry, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a son&rsquo;s law; but he mustn&rsquo;t
      go again&rsquo; the laws of his nature to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just be quiet at present&mdash;talk of other things, there&rsquo;s a good
      woman,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry meekly folded her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange, now, our meetin&rsquo; like this! meetin&rsquo; at all, too!&rdquo; she
      remarked contemplatively. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s them advertisements! They brings people
      together from the ends of the earth, for good or for bad. I often say,
      there&rsquo;s more lucky accidents, or unlucky ones, since advertisements was
      the rule, than ever there was before. They make a number of romances,
      depend upon it! Do you walk much in the Gardens, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now and then,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very pleasant it is there with the fine folks and flowers and titled
      people,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Berry. &ldquo;That was a handsome woman you was
      a-walkin&rsquo; beside, this mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was a handsome woman! or I should say, is, for her day ain&rsquo;t past,
      and she know it. I thought at first&mdash;by her back&mdash;it might ha&rsquo; 
      been your aunt, Mrs. Forey; for she do step out well and hold up her
      shoulders: straight as a dart she be! But when I come to see her face&mdash;Oh,
      dear me! says I, this ain&rsquo;t one of the family. They none of &lsquo;em got such
      bold faces&mdash;nor no lady as I know have. But she&rsquo;s a fine woman&mdash;that
      nobody can gainsay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry talked further of the fine woman. It was a liberty she took to
      speak in this disrespectful tone of her, and Mrs. Berry was quite aware
      that she was laying herself open to rebuke. She had her end in view. No
      rebuke was uttered, and during her talk she observed intercourse passing
      between the eyes of the young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Penelope,&rdquo; Richard stopped her at last. &ldquo;Will it make you
      comfortable if I tell you I&rsquo;ll obey the laws of my nature and go down at
      the end of the week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll thank the Lord of heaven if you do!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then&mdash;be happy&mdash;I will. Now listen. I want you to
      keep your rooms for me&mdash;those she had. I expect, in a day or two, to
      bring a lady here&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady?&rdquo; faltered Mrs. Berry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. A lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I make so bold as to ask what lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may not. Not now. Of course you will know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s short neck made the best imitation it could of an offended
      swan&rsquo;s action. She was very angry. She said she did not like so many
      ladies, which natural objection Richard met by saying that there was only
      one lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mrs. Berry,&rdquo; he added, dropping his voice. &ldquo;You will treat her as you
      did my dear girl, for she will require not only shelter but kindness. I
      would rather leave her with you than with any one. She has been very
      unfortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His serious air and habitual tone of command fascinated the softness of
      Berry, and it was not until he had gone that she spoke out. &ldquo;Unfort&rsquo;nate!
      He&rsquo;s going to bring me an unfort&rsquo;nate female! Oh! not from my babe can I
      bear that! Never will I have her here! I see it. It&rsquo;s that bold-faced
      woman he&rsquo;s got mixed up in, and she&rsquo;ve been and made the young man think
      he&rsquo;ll go for to reform her. It&rsquo;s one o&rsquo; their arts&mdash;that is; and he&rsquo;s
      too innocent a young man to mean anythin&rsquo; else. But I ain&rsquo;t a house of
      Magdalens no! and sooner than have her here I&rsquo;d have the roof fall over
      me, I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down to eat her supper on the sublime resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      In love, Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s charity was all on the side of the law, and this is
      the case with many of her sisters. The Pilgrim sneers at them for it, and
      would have us credit that it is their admirable instinct which, at the
      expense of every virtue save one, preserves the artificial barrier simply
      to impose upon us. Men, I presume, are hardly fair judges, and should
      stand aside and mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early next day Mrs. Berry bundled off to Richard&rsquo;s hotel to let him know
      her determination. She did not find him there. Returning homeward through
      the park, she beheld him on horseback riding by the side of the identical
      lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of this public exposure shocked her more than the secret walk
      under the trees... &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look near your reform yet,&rdquo; Mrs. Berry
      apostrophized her. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look to me one that&rsquo;d come the Fair Penitent
      till you&rsquo;ve left off bein&rsquo; fair&mdash;if then you do, which some of ye
      don&rsquo;t. Laugh away and show yet airs! Spite o&rsquo; your hat and feather, and
      your ridin&rsquo; habit, you&rsquo;re a Belle Donna.&rdquo; Setting her down again
      absolutely for such, whatever it might signify, Mrs. Berry had a virtuous
      glow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening she heard the noise of wheels stopping at the door.
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she rose from her chair to exclaim. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t rided her out in
      the mornin&rsquo;, and been and made a Magdalen of her afore dark?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A lady veiled was brought into the house by Richard. Mrs. Berry feebly
      tried to bar his progress in the passage. He pushed past her, and
      conducted the lady into the parlour without speaking. Mrs. Berry did not
      follow. She heard him murmur a few sentences within. Then he came out. All
      her crest stood up, as she whispered vigorously, &ldquo;Mr. Richard! if that
      woman stay here, I go forth. My house ain&rsquo;t a penitentiary for unfort&rsquo;nate
      females, sir&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He frowned at her curiously; but as she was on the point of renewing her
      indignant protest, he clapped his hand across her mouth, and spoke words
      in her ear that had awful import to her. She trembled, breathing low: &ldquo;My
      God, forgive, me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard?&rdquo; And her virtue was humbled. &ldquo;Lady Feverel is it? Your mother,
      Mr. Richard?&rdquo; And her virtue was humbled.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      One may suppose that a prematurely aged, oily little man; a poet in bad
      circumstances; a decrepit butterfly chained to a disappointed inkstand,
      will not put out strenuous energies to retain his ancient paramour when a
      robust young man comes imperatively to demand his mother of him in her
      person. The colloquy was short between Diaper Sandoe and Richard. The
      question was referred to the poor spiritless lady, who, seeing that her
      son made no question of it, cast herself on his hands. Small loss to her
      was Diaper; but he was the loss of habit, and that is something to a woman
      who has lived. The blood of her son had been running so long alien from
      her that the sense of her motherhood smote he now with strangeness, and
      Richard&rsquo;s stern gentleness seemed like dreadful justice come upon her. Her
      heart had almost forgotten its maternal functions. She called him Sir,
      till he bade her remember he was her son. Her voice sounded to him like
      that of a broken-throated lamb, so painful and weak it was, with the
      plaintive stop in the utterance. When he kissed her, her skin was cold.
      Her thin hand fell out of his when his grasp related. &ldquo;Can sin hunt one
      like this?&rdquo; he asked, bitterly reproaching himself for the shame she had
      caused him to endure, and a deep compassion filled his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poetic justice had been dealt to Diaper the poet. He thought of all he had
      sacrificed for this woman&mdash;the comfortable quarters, the friend, the
      happy flights. He could not but accuse her of unfaithfulness in leaving
      him in his old age. Habit had legalized his union with her. He wrote as
      pathetically of the break of habit as men feel at the death of love, and
      when we are old and have no fair hope tossing golden locks before us, a
      wound to this our second nature is quite as sad. I know not even if it be
      not actually sadder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day by day Richard visited his mother. Lady Blandish and Ripton alone were
      in the secret. Adrian let him do as he pleased. He thought proper to tell
      him that the public recognition he accorded to a particular lady was, in
      the present state of the world, scarcely prudent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a proof to me of your moral rectitude, my son, but the world will
      not think so. No one character is sufficient to cover two&mdash;in a
      Protestant country especially. The divinity that doth hedge a Bishop would
      have no chance, in contact with your Madam Danae. Drop the woman, my son.
      Or permit me to speak what you would have her hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard listened to him with disgust. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve had my doctorial
      warning,&rdquo; said Adrian; and plunged back into his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lady Feverel had revived to take part in the consultations Mrs. Berry
      perpetually opened on the subject of Richard&rsquo;s matrimonial duty, another
      chain was cast about him. &ldquo;Do not, oh, do not offend your father!&rdquo; was her
      one repeated supplication. Sir Austin had grown to be a vindictive phantom
      in her mind. She never wept but when she said this.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mrs. Berry, to whom Richard had once made mention of Lady Blandish as
      the only friend he had among women, bundled off in her black-satin dress
      to obtain an interview with her, and an ally. After coming to an
      understanding on the matter of the visit, and reiterating many of her
      views concerning young married people, Mrs. Berry said: &ldquo;My lady, if I may
      speak so bold, I&rsquo;d say the sin that&rsquo;s bein&rsquo; done is the sin o&rsquo; the
      lookers-on. And when everybody appear frightened by that young gentleman&rsquo;s
      father, I&rsquo;ll say&mdash;hopin&rsquo; your pardon&mdash;they no cause be frighted
      at all. For though it&rsquo;s nigh twenty year since I knew him, and I knew him
      then just sixteen months&mdash;no more&mdash;I&rsquo;ll say his heart&rsquo;s as soft
      as a woman&rsquo;s, which I&rsquo;ve cause for to know. And that&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s where
      everybody&rsquo;s deceived by him, and I was. It&rsquo;s because he keeps his face,
      and makes ye think you&rsquo;re dealin&rsquo; with a man of iron, and all the while
      there&rsquo;s a woman underneath. And a man that&rsquo;s like a woman he&rsquo;s the puzzle
      o&rsquo; life! We can see through ourselves, my lady, and we can see through
      men, but one o&rsquo; that sort&mdash;he&rsquo;s like somethin&rsquo; out of nature. Then I
      say&mdash;hopin&rsquo; be excused&mdash;what&rsquo;s to do is for to treat him like a
      woman, and not for to let him have his own way&mdash;which he don&rsquo;t know
      himself, and is why nobody else do. Let that sweet young couple come
      together, and be wholesome in spite of him, I say; and then give him time
      to come round, just like a woman; and round he&rsquo;ll come, and give &lsquo;em his
      blessin&rsquo;, and we shall know we&rsquo;ve made him comfortable. He&rsquo;s angry because
      matrimony have come between him and his son, and he, woman-like, he&rsquo;s
      wantin&rsquo; to treat what is as if it isn&rsquo;t. But matrimony&rsquo;s a holier than
      him. It began long long before him, and it&rsquo;s be hoped will endoor longs
      the time after, if the world&rsquo;s not coming to rack&mdash;wishin&rsquo; him no
      harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Mrs. Berry only put Lady Blandish&rsquo;s thoughts in bad English. The lady
      took upon herself seriously to advise Richard to send for his wife. He
      wrote, bidding her come. Lucy, however, had wits, and inexperienced wits
      are as a little knowledge. In pursuance of her sage plan to make the
      family feel her worth, and to conquer the members of it one by one, she
      had got up a correspondence with Adrian, whom it tickled. Adrian
      constantly assured her all was going well: time would heal the wound if
      both the offenders had the fortitude to be patient: he fancied he saw
      signs of the baronet&rsquo;s relenting: they must do nothing to arrest those
      favourable symptoms. Indeed the wise youth was languidly seeking to
      produce them. He wrote, and felt, as Lucy&rsquo;s benefactor. So Lucy replied to
      her husband a cheerful rigmarole he could make nothing of, save that she
      was happy in hope, and still had fears. Then Mrs. Berry trained her fist
      to indite a letter to her bride. Her bride answered it by saying she
      trusted to time. &ldquo;You poor marter&rdquo; Mrs. Berry wrote back, &ldquo;I know what
      your sufferin&rsquo;s be. They is the only kind a wife should never hide from
      her husband. He thinks all sorts of things if she can abide being away.
      And you trusting to time, why it&rsquo;s like trusting not to catch cold out of
      your natural clothes.&rdquo; There was no shaking Lucy&rsquo;s firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard gave it up. He began to think that the life lying behind him was
      the life of a fool. What had he done in it? He had burnt a rick and got
      married! He associated the two acts of his existence. Where was the hero
      he was to have carved out of Tom Bakewell!&mdash;a wretch he had taught to
      lie and chicane: and for what? Great heavens! how ignoble did a flash from
      the light of his aspirations make his marriage appear! The young man
      sought amusement. He allowed his aunt to drag him into society, and sick
      of that he made late evening calls on Mrs. Mount, oblivious of the purpose
      he had in visiting her at all. Her man-like conversation, which he took
      for honesty, was a refreshing change on fair lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me Bella: I&rsquo;ll call you Dick,&rdquo; said she. And it came to be Bella and
      Dick between them. No mention of Bella occurred in Richard&rsquo;s letters to
      Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mount spoke quite openly of herself. &ldquo;I pretend to be no better than
      I am,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I know I&rsquo;m no worse than many a woman who holds her
      head high.&rdquo; To back this she told him stories of blooming dames of good
      repute, and poured a little social sewerage into his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also she understood him. &ldquo;What you want, my dear Dick, is something to do.
      You went and got married like a&mdash;hum!&mdash;friends must be
      respectful. Go into the Army. Try the turf. I can put you up to a trick or
      two&mdash;friends should make themselves useful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She told him what she liked in him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only man I was ever alone
      with who don&rsquo;t talk to me of love and make me feel sick. I hate men who
      can&rsquo;t speak to a woman sensibly.&mdash;Just wait a minute.&rdquo; She left him
      and presently returned with, &ldquo;Ah, Dick! old fellow! how are you?&rdquo;&mdash;arrayed
      like a cavalier, one arm stuck in her side, her hat jauntily cocked, and a
      pretty oath on her lips to give reality to the costume. &ldquo;What do you think
      of me? Wasn&rsquo;t it a shame to make a woman of me when I was born to be a
      man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; said Richard, for the contrast in her attire to those
      shooting eyes and lips, aired her sex bewitchingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you think I don&rsquo;t do it well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charming! but I can&rsquo;t forget...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that is too bad!&rdquo; she pouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she proposed that they should go out into the midnight streets
      arm-in-arm, and out they went and had great fits of laughter at her
      impertinent manner of using her eyeglass, and outrageous affectation of
      the supreme dandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They take up men, Dick, for going about in women&rsquo;s clothes, and vice
      versaw, I suppose. You&rsquo;ll bail me, old fellaa, if I have to make my bow to
      the beak, won&rsquo;t you? Say it&rsquo;s becas I&rsquo;m an honest woman and don&rsquo;t care to
      hide the&mdash;a&mdash;unmentionables when I wear them&mdash;as the
      t&rsquo;others do,&rdquo; sprinkled with the dandy&rsquo;s famous invocations.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to conceive romance in that sort of fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a wopper, my brave Dick! won&rsquo;t let any peeler take me? by Jove!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he with many assurances guaranteed to stand by her, while she bent her
      thin fingers trying the muscle of his arm; and reposed upon it more. There
      was delicacy in her dandyism. She was a graceful cavalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Julius,&rdquo; as they named the dandy&rsquo;s attire, was frequently called for
      on his evening visits to Mrs. Mount. When he beheld Sir Julius he thought
      of the lady, and &ldquo;vice versaw,&rdquo; as Sir Julius was fond of exclaiming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was ever hero in this fashion wooed?
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman now and then would peep through Sir Julius. Or she would sit,
      and talk, and altogether forget she was impersonating that worthy fop.
    </p>
    <p>
      She never uttered an idea or a reflection, but Richard thought her the
      cleverest woman he had ever met.
    </p>
    <p>
      All kinds of problematic notions beset him. She was cold as ice, she hated
      talk about love, and she was branded by the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rumour spread that reached Mrs. Doria&rsquo;s ears. She rushed to Adrian
      first. The wise youth believed there was nothing in it. She sailed down
      upon Richard. &ldquo;Is this true? that you have been seen going publicly about
      with an infamous woman, Richard? Tell me! pray, relieve me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard knew of no person answering to his aunt&rsquo;s description in whose
      company he could have been seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, I say! Don&rsquo;t quibble. Do you know any woman of bad character?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The acquaintance of a lady very much misjudged and ill-used by the world,
      Richard admitted to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Urgent grave advice Mrs. Doria tendered her nephew, both from the moral
      and the worldly point of view, mentally ejaculating all the while: &ldquo;That
      ridiculous System! That disgraceful marriage!&rdquo; Sir Austin in his mountain
      solitude was furnished with serious stuff to brood over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rumour came to Lady Blandish. She likewise lectured Richard, and with
      her he condescended to argue. But he found himself obliged to instance
      something he had quite neglected. &ldquo;Instead of her doing me harm, it&rsquo;s I
      that will do her good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Blandish shook her head and held up her finger. &ldquo;This person must be
      very clever to have given you that delusion, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is clever. And the world treats her shamefully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She complains of her position to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word. But I will stand by her. She has no friend but me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor boy! has she made you think that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How unjust you all are!&rdquo; cried Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How mad and wicked is the man who can let him be tempted so!&rdquo; thought
      Lady Blandish.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would pronounce no promise not to visit her, not to address her
      publicly. The world that condemned her and cast her out was no better&mdash;worse
      for its miserable hypocrisy. He knew the world now, the young man said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child! the world may be very bad. I am not going to defend it. But you
      have some one else to think of. Have you forgotten you have a wife,
      Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! you all speak of her now. There&rsquo;s my aunt: &lsquo;Remember you have a
      wife!&rsquo; Do you think I love any one but Lucy? poor little thing! Because I
      am married am I to give up the society of women?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much so!&rdquo; sighed the defender of her sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian became more emphatic in his warnings. Richard laughed at him. The
      wise youth sneered at Mrs. Mount. The hero then favoured him with a
      warning equal to his own in emphasis, and surpassing it in sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t quarrel, my dear boy,&rdquo; said Adrian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a man of peace.
      Besides, we are not fairly proportioned for a combat. Ride your steed to
      virtue&rsquo;s goal! All I say is, that I think he&rsquo;ll upset you, and it&rsquo;s better
      to go at a slow pace and in companionship with the children of the sun.
      You have a very nice little woman for a wife&mdash;well, good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To have his wife and the world thrown at his face, was unendurable to
      Richard; he associated them somewhat after the manner of the rick and the
      marriage. Charming Sir Julius, always gay, always honest, dispersed his
      black moods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re taller,&rdquo; Richard made the discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am. Don&rsquo;t you remember you said I was such a little thing
      when I came out of my woman&rsquo;s shell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how have you done it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grown to please you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, if you can do that, you can do anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I would do anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&rdquo;...his project recurred to him. But the incongruity of speaking
      seriously to Sir Julius struck him dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what?&rdquo; asked she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re a gallant fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite. You were going to say something. I saw it in your eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw that I admired you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but a man mustn&rsquo;t admire a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I had an idea you were a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! when I had the heels of my boots raised half an inch,&rdquo; Sir Julius
      turned one heel, and volleyed out silver laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t come much above your shoulder even now,&rdquo; she said, and proceeded
      to measure her height beside him with arch up-glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must grow more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Fraid I can&rsquo;t, Dick! Bootmakers can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you how,&rdquo; and he lifted Sir Julius lightly, and bore the fair
      gentleman to the looking-glass, holding him there exactly on a level with
      his head. &ldquo;Will that do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Oh but I can&rsquo;t stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He should have known then&mdash;it was thundered at a closed door in him,
      that he played with fire. But the door being closed, he thought himself
      internally secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met. He put her down instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Julius, charming as he was, lost his vogue. Seeing that, the wily
      woman resumed her shell. The memory, of Sir Julius breathing about her
      still, doubled the feminine attraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to have been an actress,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard told her he found all natural women had a similar wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Ah! then! if I had been!&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Mount, gazing on the pattern
      of the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand, and pressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not happy as you are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I speak to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her nearest eye, setting a dimple of her cheek in motion, slid to the
      corner toward her ear, as she sat with her head sideways to him,
      listening. When he had gone, she said to herself: &ldquo;Old hypocrites talk in
      that way; but I never heard of a young man doing it, and not making love
      at the same time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their next meeting displayed her quieter: subdued as one who had been set
      thinking. He lauded her fair looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me thrice ashamed,&rdquo; she petitioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not only that mood with her. Dauntless defiance, that
      splendidly befitted her gallant outline and gave a wildness to her bright
      bold eyes, when she would call out: &ldquo;Happy? who dares say I&rsquo;m not happy?
      D&rsquo;you think if the world whips me I&rsquo;ll wince? D&rsquo;you think I care for what
      they say or do? Let them kill me! they shall never get one cry out of me!&rdquo;
       and flashing on the young man as if he were the congregated enemy, add:
      &ldquo;There! now you know me!&rdquo;&mdash;that was a mood that well became her, and
      helped the work. She ought to have been an actress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This must not go on,&rdquo; said Lady Blandish and Mrs. Doria in unison. A
      common object brought them together. They confined their talk to it, and
      did not disagree. Mrs. Doria engaged to go down to the baronet. Both
      ladies knew it was a dangerous, likely to turn out a disastrous,
      expedition. They agreed to it because it was something to do, and doing
      anything is better than doing nothing. &ldquo;Do it,&rdquo; said the wise youth, when
      they made him a third, &ldquo;do it, if you want him to be a hermit for life.
      You will bring back nothing but his dead body, ladies&mdash;a Hellenic,
      rather than a Roman, triumph. He will listen to you&mdash;he will
      accompany you to the station&mdash;he will hand you into the carriage&mdash;and
      when you point to his seat he will bow profoundly, and retire into his
      congenial mists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian spoke their thoughts. They fretted; they relapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak to him, you, Adrian,&rdquo; said Mrs. Doria. &ldquo;Speak to the boy solemnly.
      It would be almost better he should go back to that little thing he has
      married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost?&rdquo; Lady Blandish opened her eyes. &ldquo;I have been advising it for the
      last month and more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A choice of evils,&rdquo; said Mrs. Doria&rsquo;s sour-sweet face and shake of the
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each lady saw a point of dissension, and mutually agreed, with heroic
      effort, to avoid it by shutting their mouths. What was more, they
      preserved the peace in spite of Adrian&rsquo;s artifices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll talk to him again,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to get the Engine on
      the conventional line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Command him!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Doria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentle means are, I think, the only means with Richard,&rdquo; said Lady
      Blandish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throwing banter aside, as much as he could, Adrian spoke to Richard. &ldquo;You
      want to reform this woman. Her manner is open&mdash;fair and free&mdash;the
      traditional characteristic. We won&rsquo;t stop to canvass how that particular
      honesty of deportment that wins your approbation has been gained. In her
      college it is not uncommon. Girls, you know, are not like boys. At a
      certain age they can&rsquo;t be quite natural. It&rsquo;s a bad sign if they don&rsquo;t
      blush, and fib, and affect this and that. It wears off when they&rsquo;re women.
      But a woman who speaks like a man, and has all those excellent virtues you
      admire&mdash;where has she learned the trick? She tells you. You don&rsquo;t
      surely approve of the school? Well, what is there in it, then? Reform her,
      of course. The task is worthy of your energies. But, if you are appointed
      to do it, don&rsquo;t do it publicly, and don&rsquo;t attempt it just now. May I ask
      you whether your wife participates in this undertaking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard walked away from the interrogation. The wise youth, who hated long
      unrelieved speeches and had healed his conscience, said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear tender Lucy! Poor darling! Richard&rsquo;s eyes moistened. Her letters
      seemed sadder latterly. Yet she never called to him to come, or he would
      have gone. His heart leapt up to her. He announced to Adrian that he
      should wait no longer for his father. Adrian placidly nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enchantress observed that her knight had a clouded brow and an absent
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard&mdash;I can&rsquo;t call you Dick now, I really don&rsquo;t know why&rdquo;&mdash;she
      said, &ldquo;I want to beg a favour of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name it. I can still call you Bella, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you care to. What I want to say is this: when you meet me out&mdash;to
      cut it short&mdash;please not to recognize me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ask to be told that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then look: I won&rsquo;t compromise you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see no harm, Bella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she caressed his hand, &ldquo;and there is none. I know that. But,&rdquo; modest
      eyelids were drooped, &ldquo;other people do,&rdquo; struggling eyes were raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do we care for other people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. I don&rsquo;t. Not that!&rdquo; snapping her finger, &ldquo;I care for you,
      though.&rdquo; A prolonged look followed the declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re foolish, Bella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite so giddy&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not combat it with his usual impetuosity. Adrian&rsquo;s abrupt inquiry
      had sunk in his mind, as the wise youth intended it should. He had
      instinctively refrained from speaking to Lucy of this lady. But what a
      noble creature the woman was!
    </p>
    <p>
      So they met in the park; Mrs. Mount whipped past him; and secresy added a
      new sense to their intimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian was gratified at the result produced by his eloquence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though this lady never expressed an idea, Richard was not mistaken in her
      cleverness. She could make evenings pass gaily, and one was not the fellow
      to the other. She could make you forget she was a woman, and then bring
      the fact startlingly home to you. She could read men with one quiver of
      her half-closed eye-lashes. She could catch the coming mood in a man, and
      fit herself to it. What does a woman want with ideas, who can do thus
      much? Keenness of perception, conformity, delicacy of handling, these be
      all the qualities necessary to parasites.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love would have scared the youth: she banished it from her tongue. It may
      also have been true that it sickened her. She played on his higher nature.
      She understood spontaneously what would be most strange and taking to him
      in a woman. Various as the Serpent of old Nile, she acted fallen beauty,
      humorous indifference, reckless daring, arrogance in ruin. And acting
      thus, what think you?&mdash;She did it so well because she was growing
      half in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard! I am not what I was since I knew you. You will not give me up
      quite?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, Bella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so bad as I&rsquo;m painted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are only unfortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that I know you I think so, and yet I am happier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She told him her history when this soft horizon of repentance seemed to
      throw heaven&rsquo;s twilight across it. A woman&rsquo;s history, you know: certain
      chapters expunged. It was dark enough to Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you love the man?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You say you love no one now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I love him? He was a nobleman and I a tradesman&rsquo;s daughter. No. I did
      not love him. I have lived to learn it. And now I should hate him, if I
      did not despise him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you be deceived in love?&rdquo; said Richard, more to himself than to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. When we&rsquo;re young we can be very easily deceived. If there is such a
      thing as love, we discover it after we have tossed about and roughed it.
      Then we find the man, or the woman, that suits us:&mdash;and then it&rsquo;s too
      late! we can&rsquo;t have him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Singular!&rdquo; murmured Richard, &ldquo;she says just what my father said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke aloud: &ldquo;I could forgive you if you had loved him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be harsh, grave judge! How is a girl to distinguish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had some affection for him? He was the first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She chose to admit that. &ldquo;Yes. And the first who talks of love to a girl
      must be a fool if he doesn&rsquo;t blind her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes what is called first love nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He repelled the insinuation. &ldquo;Because I know it is not, Bella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless she had opened a wider view of the world to him, and a
      colder. He thought poorly of girls. A woman a sensible, brave, beautiful
      woman seemed, on comparison, infinitely nobler than those weak creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was best in her character of lovely rebel accusing foul injustice.
      &ldquo;What am I to do? You tell me to be different. How can I? What am I to do?
      Will virtuous people let me earn my bread? I could not get a housemaid&rsquo;s
      place! They wouldn&rsquo;t have me&mdash;I see their noses smelling! Yes I can
      go to the hospital and sing behind a screen! Do you expect me to bury
      myself alive? Why, man, I have blood: I can&rsquo;t become a stone. You say I am
      honest, and I will be. Then let me till you that I have been used to
      luxuries, and I can&rsquo;t do without them. I might have married men&mdash;lots
      would have had me. But who marries one like me but a fool? and I could not
      marry a fool. The man I marry I must respect. He could not respect me&mdash;I
      should know him to be a fools and I should be worse off than I am now. As
      I am now, they may look as pious as they like&mdash;I laugh at them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so forth: direr things. Imputations upon wives: horrible exultation at
      the universal peccancy of husbands. This lovely outcast almost made him
      think she had the right on her side, so keenly her Parthian arrows pierced
      the holy centres of society, and exposed its rottenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mount&rsquo;s house was discreetly conducted: nothing ever occurred to
      shock him there. The young man would ask himself where the difference was
      between her and the Women of society? How base, too, was the army of
      banded hypocrites! He was ready to declare war against them on her behalf.
      His casus beli, accurately worded, would have read curiously. Because the
      world refused to lure the lady to virtue with the offer of a housemaid&rsquo;s
      place, our knight threw down his challenge. But the lady had scornfully
      rebutted this prospect of a return to chastity. Then the form of the
      challenge must be: Because the world declined to support the lady in
      luxury for nothing! But what did that mean? In other words: she was to
      receive the devil&rsquo;s wages without rendering him her services. Such an
      arrangement appears hardly fair on the world or on the devil. Heroes will
      have to conquer both before they will get them to subscribe to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heroes, however, are not in the habit of wording their declarations of war
      at all. Lance in rest they challenge and they charge. Like women they
      trust to instinct, and graft on it the muscle of men. Wide fly the
      leisurely-remonstrating hosts: institutions are scattered, they know not
      wherefore, heads are broken that have not the balm of a reason why. &lsquo;Tis
      instinct strikes! Surely there is something divine in instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, war declared, where were these hosts? The hero could not charge
      down on the ladies and gentlemen in a ballroom, and spoil the quadrille.
      He had sufficient reticence to avoid sounding his challenge in the Law
      Courts; nor could he well go into the Houses of Parliament with a trumpet,
      though to come to a tussle with the nation&rsquo;s direct representatives did
      seem the likelier method. It was likewise out of the question that he
      should enter every house and shop, and battle with its master in the cause
      of Mrs. Mount. Where, then, was his enemy? Everybody was his enemy, and
      everybody was nowhere! Shall he convoke multitudes on Wimbledon Common?
      Blue Policemen, and a distant dread of ridicule, bar all his projects.
      Alas for the hero in our day!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing teaches a strong arm its impotence so much as knocking at empty
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do for this poor woman?&rdquo; cried Richard, after fighting his
      phantom enemy till he was worn out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Rip! old Rip!&rdquo; he addressed his friend, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m distracted. I wish I was
      dead! What good am I for? Miserable! selfish! What have I done but make
      every soul I know wretched about me? I follow my own inclinations&mdash;I
      make people help me by lying as hard as they can&mdash;and I&rsquo;m a liar. And
      when I&rsquo;ve got it I&rsquo;m ashamed of myself. And now when I do see something
      unselfish for me to do, I come upon grins&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know where to turn&mdash;how
      to act&mdash;and I laugh at myself like a devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was only friend Ripton&rsquo;s ear that was required, so his words went for
      little: but Ripton did say he thought there was small matter to be ashamed
      of in winning and wearing the Beauty of Earth. Richard added his customary
      comment of &ldquo;Poor little thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fought his duello with empty air till he was exhausted. A last letter
      written to his father procured him no reply. Then, said he, I have tried
      my utmost. I have tried to be dutiful&mdash;my father won&rsquo;t listen to me.
      One thing I can do&mdash;I can go down to my dear girl, and make her
      happy, and save her at least from some of the consequences of my rashness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing better for me!&rdquo; he groaned. His great ambition must be
      covered by a house-top: he and the cat must warm themselves on the
      domestic hearth! The hero was not aware that his heart moved him to this.
      His heart was not now in open communion with his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mount heard that her friend was going&mdash;would go. She knew he was
      going to his wife. Far from discouraging him, she said nobly: &ldquo;Go&mdash;I
      believe I have kept you. Let us have an evening together, and then go: for
      good, if you like. If not, then to meet again another time. Forget me. I
      shan&rsquo;t forget you. You&rsquo;re the best fellow I ever knew, Richard. You are,
      on my honour! I swear I would not step in between you and your wife to
      cause either of you a moment&rsquo;s unhappiness. When I can be another woman I
      will, and I shall think of you then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Blandish heard from Adrian that Richard was positively going to his
      wife. The wise youth modestly veiled his own merit in bringing it about by
      saying: &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t see that poor little woman left alone down there any
      longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! Yes!&rdquo; said Mrs. Doria, to whom the modest speech was repeated, &ldquo;I
      suppose, poor boy, it&rsquo;s the best he can do now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard bade them adieu, and went to spend his last evening with Mrs.
      Mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enchantress received him in state.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know this dress? No? It&rsquo;s the dress I wore when I first met you&mdash;not
      when I first saw you. I think I remarked you, sir, before you deigned to
      cast an eye upon humble me. When we first met we drank champagne together,
      and I intend to celebrate our parting in the same liquor. Will you liquor
      with me, old boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was gay. She revived Sir Julius occasionally. He, dispirited, left the
      talking all to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mount kept a footman. At a late hour the man of calves dressed the
      table for supper. It was a point of honour for Richard to sit down to it
      and try to eat. Drinking, thanks to the kindly mother nature, who loves to
      see her children made fools of, is always an easier matter. The footman
      was diligent; the champagne corks feebly recalled the file-firing at
      Richmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll drink to what we might have been, Dick,&rdquo; said the enchantress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the glorious wreck she looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart choked as he gulped the buzzing wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! down, my boy?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;They shall never see me hoist signals of
      distress. We must all die, and the secret of the thing is to die game, by
      Jove! Did you ever hear of Laura Fern? a superb girl! handsomer than your
      humble servant&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll believe it&mdash;a &lsquo;Miss&rsquo; in the bargain,
      and as a consequence, I suppose, a much greater rake. She was in the
      hunting-field. Her horse threw her, and she fell plump on a stake. It went
      into her left breast. All the fellows crowded round her, and one young
      man, who was in love with her&mdash;he sits in the House of Peers now&mdash;we
      used to call him `Duck&rsquo; because he was such a dear&mdash;he dropped from
      his horse to his knees: &lsquo;Laura! Laura! my darling! speak a word to me!&mdash;the
      last!&rsquo; She turned over all white and bloody! &lsquo;I&mdash;I shan&rsquo;t be in at
      the death!&rsquo; and gave up the ghost! Wasn&rsquo;t that dying game? Here&rsquo;s to the
      example of Laura Fenn! Why, what&rsquo;s the matter? See! it makes a man turn
      pale to hear how a woman can die. Fill the glasses, John. Why, you&rsquo;re as
      bad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s give me a turn, my lady,&rdquo; pleaded John, and the man&rsquo;s hand was
      unsteady as he poured out the wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought not to listen. Go, and, drink some brandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John footman went from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brave Dick! Richard! what a face you&rsquo;ve got!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He showed a deep frown on a colourless face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you bear to hear of blood? You know, it was only one naughty woman
      out of the world. The clergyman of the parish didn&rsquo;t refuse to give her
      decent burial. We Christians! Hurrah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She cheered, and laughed. A lurid splendour glanced about her like lights
      from the pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pledge me, Dick! Drink, and recover yourself. Who minds? We must all die&mdash;the
      good and the bad. Ashes to ashes&mdash;dust to dust&mdash;and wine for
      living lips! That&rsquo;s poetry&mdash;almost. Sentiment: `May we never say die
      till we&rsquo;ve drunk our fill! Not bad&mdash;eh? A little vulgar, perhaps, by
      Jove! Do you think me horrid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the wine?&rdquo; Richard shouted. He drank a couple of glasses in
      succession, and stared about. Was he in hell, with a lost soul raving to
      him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobly spoken! and nobly acted upon, my brave Dick! Now we&rsquo;ll be
      companions.&rdquo; She wished that heaven had made her such a man. &ldquo;Ah! Dick!
      Dick! too late! too late!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Softly fell her voice. Her eyes threw slanting beams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pointed to a symbolic golden anchor studded with gems and coiled with
      a rope of hair in her bosom. It was a gift of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know when I stole the lock? Foolish Dick! you gave me an anchor
      without a rope. Come and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose from the table, and threw herself on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you recognize your own hair! I should know a thread of mine among a
      million.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something of the strength of Samson went out of him as he inspected his
      hair on the bosom of Delilah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you knew nothing of it! You hardly know it now you see it! What
      couldn&rsquo;t a woman steal from you? But you&rsquo;re not vain, and that&rsquo;s a
      protection. You&rsquo;re a miracle, Dick: a man that&rsquo;s not vain! Sit here.&rdquo; She
      curled up her feet to give him place on the sofa. &ldquo;Now let us talk like
      friends that part to meet no more. You found a ship with fever on board,
      and you weren&rsquo;t afraid to come alongside and keep her company. The fever
      isn&rsquo;t catching, you see. Let us mingle our tears together. Ha! ha! a man
      said that once to me. The hypocrite wanted to catch the fever, but he was
      too old. How old are you, Dick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard pushed a few months forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-one? You just look it, you blooming boy. Now tell me my age,
      Adonis!&mdash;Twenty&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard had given the lady twenty-five years.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed violently. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t pay compliments, Dick. Best to be
      honest; guess again. You don&rsquo;t like to? Not twenty-five, or twenty-four,
      or twenty-three, or see how he begins to stare!&mdash;-twenty-two. Just
      twenty-one, my dear. I think my birthday&rsquo;s somewhere in next month. Why,
      look at me, close&mdash;closer. Have I a wrinkle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when, in heaven&rsquo;s name!&rdquo;...he stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you. When did I commence for to live? At the ripe age of
      sixteen I saw a nobleman in despair because of my beauty. He vowed he&rsquo;d
      die. I didn&rsquo;t want him to do that. So to save the poor man for his family,
      I ran away with him, and I dare say they didn&rsquo;t appreciate the sacrifice,
      and he soon forgot to, if he ever did. It&rsquo;s the way of the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard seized some dead champagne, emptied the bottle into a tumbler, and
      drank it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      John footman entered to clear the table, and they were left without
      further interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bella! Bella!&rdquo; Richard uttered in a deep sad voice, as he walked the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned on her arm, her hair crushed against a reddened cheek, her eyes
      half-shut and dreamy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bella!&rdquo; he dropped beside her. &ldquo;You are unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She blinked and yawned, as one who is awakened suddenly. &ldquo;I think you
      spoke,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are unhappy, Bella. You can&rsquo;t conceal it. Your laugh sounds like
      madness. You must be unhappy. So young, too! Only twenty-one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it matter? Who cares for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mighty pity falling from his eyes took in her whole shape. She did not
      mistake it for tenderness, as another would have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who cares for you, Bella? I do. What makes my misery now, but to see you
      there, and know of no way of helping you? Father of mercy! it seems too
      much to have to stand by powerless while such ruin is going on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hand was shaken in his by the passion of torment with which his frame
      quaked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily a tear started between her eyelids. She glanced up at him
      quickly, then looked down, drew her hand from his, and smoothed it, eying
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bella! you have a father alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A linendraper, dear. He wears a white neck-cloth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This article of apparel instantaneously changed the tone of the
      conversation, for he, rising abruptly, nearly squashed the lady&rsquo;s lap-dog,
      whose squeaks and howls were piteous, and demanded the most fervent
      caresses of its mistress. It was: &ldquo;Oh, my poor pet Mumpsy, and he didn&rsquo;t
      like a nasty great big ugly heavy foot an his poor soft silky&mdash;mum&mdash;mum&mdash;back,
      he didn&rsquo;t, and he soodn&rsquo;t that he&mdash;mum&mdash;mum&mdash;soodn&rsquo;t; and
      he cried out and knew the place to come to, and was oh so sorry for what
      had happened to him&mdash;mum&mdash;mum&mdash;mum&mdash;and now he was
      going to be made happy, his mistress make him happy&mdash;mum&mdash;mum&mdash;mum&mdash;moo-o-o-o.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Richard, savagely, from the other end of the room, &ldquo;you care
      for the happiness of your dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A course se does,&rdquo; Mumpsy was simperingly assured in the thick of his
      silky flanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard looked for his hat. Mumpsy was deposited on the sofa in a
      twinkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;you must come and beg Mumpsy&rsquo;s pardon, whether you
      meant to do it or no, because little doggies can&rsquo;t tell that&mdash;how
      should they? And there&rsquo;s poor Mumpsy thinking you&rsquo;re a great terrible
      rival that tries to squash him all flat to nothing, on purpose, pretending
      you didn&rsquo;t see; and he&rsquo;s trembling, poor dear wee pet! And I may love my
      dog, sir, if I like; and I do; and I won&rsquo;t have him ill-treated, for he&rsquo;s
      never been jealous of you, and he is a darling, ten times truer than men,
      and I love him fifty times better. So come to him with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      First a smile changed Richard&rsquo;s face; then laughing a melancholy laugh, he
      surrendered to her humour, and went through the form of begging Mumpsy&rsquo;s
      pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dear dog! I do believe he saw we were getting dull,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And immolated himself intentionally? Noble animal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll act as if we thought so. Let us be gay, Richard, and not part
      like ancient fogies. Where&rsquo;s your fun? You can rattle; why don&rsquo;t you? You
      haven&rsquo;t seen me in one of my characters&mdash;not Sir Julius: wait a
      couple of minutes.&rdquo; She ran out.
    </p>
    <p>
      A white visage reappeared behind a spring of flame. Her black hair was
      scattered over her shoulders and fell half across her brows. She moved
      slowly, and came up to him, fastening weird eyes on him, pointing a finger
      at the region of witches. Sepulchral cadences accompanied the
      representation. He did not listen, for he was thinking what a deadly
      charming and exquisitely horrid witch she was. Something in the way her
      underlids worked seemed to remind him of a forgotten picture; but a veil
      hung on the picture. There could be no analogy, for this was beautiful and
      devilish, and that, if he remembered rightly, had the beauty of seraphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      His reflections and her performance were stayed by a shriek. The spirits
      of wine had run over the plate she held to the floor. She had the coolness
      to put the plate down on the table, while he stamped out the flame on the
      carpet. Again she shrieked: she thought she was on fire. He fell on his
      knees and clasped her skirts all round, drawing his arms down them several
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still kneeling, he looked up, and asked, &ldquo;Do you feel safe now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bent her face glaring down till the ends of her hair touched his
      cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said she, &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was she a witch verily? There was sorcery in her breath; sorcery in her
      hair: the ends of it stung him like little snakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I do it, Dick?&rdquo; she flung back, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like you do everything, Bella,&rdquo; he said, and took breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! I won&rsquo;t be a witch; I won&rsquo;t be a witch: they may burn me to a
      cinder, but I won&rsquo;t be a witch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sang, throwing her hair about, and stamping her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I look a figure. I must go and tidy myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t change. I like to see you so.&rdquo; He gazed at her with a mixture
      of wonder and admiration. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think you the same person&mdash;not
      even when you laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; her tone was serious, &ldquo;you were going to speak to me of my
      parents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How wild and awful you looked, Bella!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father, Richard, was a very respectable man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bella, you&rsquo;ll haunt me like a ghost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother died in my infancy, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put up your hair, Bella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was an only child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her head shook sorrowfully at the glistening fire-irons. He followed the
      abstracted intentness of her look, and came upon her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! speak of your father, Bella. Speak of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I haunt you, and come to your bedside, and cry, &lsquo;`Tis time&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Bella! if you will tell me where he lives, I will go to him. He
      shall receive you. He shall not refuse&mdash;he shall forgive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I haunt you, you can&rsquo;t forget me, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go to your father, Bella let me go to him to-morrow. I&rsquo;ll give you
      my time. It&rsquo;s all I can give. O Bella! let me save you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you like me best dishevelled, do you, you naughty boy! Ha! ha!&rdquo; and
      away she burst from him, and up flew her hair, as she danced across the
      room, and fell at full length on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt giddy: bewitched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk of everyday things, Dick,&rdquo; she called to him from the sofa.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our last evening. Our last? Heigho! It makes me sentimental. How&rsquo;s
      that Mr. Ripson, Pipson, Nipson?&mdash;it&rsquo;s not complimentary, but I can&rsquo;t
      remember names of that sort. Why do you have friends of that sort? He&rsquo;s
      not a gentleman. Better is he? Well, he&rsquo;s rather too insignificant for me.
      Why do you sit off there? Come to me instantly. There&mdash;I&rsquo;ll sit up,
      and be proper, and you&rsquo;ll have plenty of room. Talk, Dick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was reflecting on the fact that her eyes were brown. They had a haughty
      sparkle when she pleased, and when she pleased a soft languor circled
      them. Excitement had dyed her cheeks deep red. He was a youth, and she an
      enchantress. He a hero; she a female will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes were languid now, set in rosy colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not leave me yet, Richard? not yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had no thought of departing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our last night&mdash;I suppose it&rsquo;s our last hour together in this
      world&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t want to meet you in the next, for poor Dick will
      have to come to such a very, very disagreeable place to make the visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He grasped her hand at this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he will! too true! can&rsquo;t be helped: they say I&rsquo;m handsome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lovely, Bella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drank in his homage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll admit it. His Highness below likes lovely women, I hear say.
      A gentleman of taste! You don&rsquo;t know all my accomplishments yet, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be astonished at anything new, Bella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then hear, and wonder.&rdquo; Her voice trolled out some lively roulades.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think he&rsquo;ll make me his prima donna below? It&rsquo;s nonsense to
      tell me there&rsquo;s no singing there. And the atmosphere will be favourable to
      the voice. No damp, you know. You saw the piano&mdash;why didn&rsquo;t you ask
      me to sing before? I can sing Italian. I had a master&mdash;who made love
      to me. I forgave him because of the music-stool&mdash;men can&rsquo;t help it on
      a music-stool, poor dears!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went to the piano, struck the notes, and sang&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;&lsquo;My heart, my heart&mdash;I think &lsquo;twill break.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m such a rake. I don&rsquo;t know any other reason. No; I hate
      sentimental songs. Won&rsquo;t sing that. Ta-tiddy-tiddy-iddy&mdash;a...e! How
      ridiculous those women were, coming home from Richmond!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &lsquo;Once the sweet romance of story
         Clad thy moving form with grace;
        Once the world and all its glory
         Was but framework to thy face.
        Ah, too fair!&mdash;what I remember
         Might my soul recall&mdash;but no!
        To the winds this wretched ember
         Of a fire that falls so low!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! don&rsquo;t much like that. Tum-te-tum-tum&mdash;accanto al fuoco&mdash;heigho!
      I don&rsquo;t want to show off, Dick&mdash;or to break down&mdash;so I won&rsquo;t try
      that.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &lsquo;Oh! but for thee, oh! but for thee,
         I might have been a happy wife,
        And nursed a baby on my knee,
         And never blushed to give it life.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to sing that when I was a girl, sweet Richard, and didn&rsquo;t know at
      all, at all, what it meant. Mustn&rsquo;t sing that sort of song in company.
      We&rsquo;re oh! so proper&mdash;even we!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;If I had a husband, what think you I&rsquo;d do?
      I&rsquo;d make it my business to keep him a lover;
     For when a young gentleman ceases to woo,
      Some other amusement he&rsquo;ll quickly discover.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For such are young gentlemen made of&mdash;made of: such are young
      gentlemen made of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this trifling she sang a Spanish ballad sweetly. He was in the mood
      when imagination intensely vivifies everything. Mere suggestions of music
      sufficed. The lady in the ballad had been wronged. Lo! it was the lady
      before him; and soft horns blew; he smelt the languid night-flowers; he
      saw the stars crowd large and close above the arid plain this lady leaning
      at her window desolate, pouring out her abandoned heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heroes know little what they owe to champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady wandered to Venice. Thither he followed her at a leap. In Venice
      she was not happy. He was prepared for the misery of any woman anywhere.
      But, oh! to be with her! To glide with phantom-motion through throbbing
      street; past houses muffled in shadow and gloomy legends; under storied
      bridges; past palaces charged with full life in dead quietness; past grand
      old towers, colossal squares, gleaming quays, and out, and on with her, on
      into the silver infinity shaking over seas!
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it the champagne? the music? or the poetry? Something of the two
      former, perhaps: but most the enchantress playing upon him. How many
      instruments cannot clever women play upon at the same moment! And this
      enchantress was not too clever, or he might have felt her touch. She was
      no longer absolutely bent on winning him, or he might have seen a
      manoeuvre. She liked him&mdash;liked none better. She wished him well. Her
      pique was satisfied. Still he was handsome, and he was going. What she
      liked him for, she rather&mdash;very slightly&mdash;wished to do away
      with, or see if it could be done away with: just as one wishes to catch a
      pretty butterfly, without hurting its patterned wings. No harm intended to
      the innocent insect, only one wants to inspect it thoroughly, and enjoy
      the marvel of it, in one&rsquo;s tender possession, and have the felicity of
      thinking one could crush it, if one would.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew her what she was, this lady. In Seville, or in Venice, the spot
      was on her. Sailing the pathways of the moon it was not celestial light
      that illumined her beauty. Her sin was there: but in dreaming to save, he
      was soft to her sin&mdash;drowned it in deep mournfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence, and the rustle of her dress, awoke him from his musing. She swam
      wave-like to the sofa. She was at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been light and careless to-night, Richard. Of course I meant it. I
      must be happy with my best friend going to leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those witch underlids were working brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not forget me? and I shall try...try...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her lips twitched. She thought him such a very handsome fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I change&mdash;if I can change... Oh! if you could know what a net I&rsquo;m
      in, Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now at those words, as he looked down on her haggard loveliness, not
      divine sorrow but a devouring jealousy sprang like fire in his breast, and
      set him rocking with horrid pain. He bent closer to her pale beseeching
      face. Her eyes still drew him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bella! No! no! promise me! swear it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lost, Richard! lost for ever! give me up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He cried: &ldquo;I never will!&rdquo; and strained her in his arms, and kissed her
      passionately on the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not acting now as she sidled and slunk her half-averted head with
      a kind of maiden shame under his arm, sighing heavily, weeping, clinging
      to him. It was wicked truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a word of love between them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Was ever hero in this fashion won?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      At a season when the pleasant South-western Island has few attractions to
      other than invalids and hermits enamoured of wind and rain, the potent
      nobleman, Lord Mountfalcon, still lingered there to the disgust of his
      friends and special parasite. &ldquo;Mount&rsquo;s in for it again,&rdquo; they said among
      themselves. &ldquo;Hang the women!&rdquo; was a natural sequence. For, don&rsquo;t you see,
      what a shame it was of the women to be always kindling such a very
      inflammable subject! All understood that Cupid had twanged his bow, and
      transfixed a peer of Britain for the fiftieth time: but none would
      perceive, though he vouched for it with his most eloquent oaths, that this
      was a totally different case from the antecedent ones. So it had been
      sworn to them too frequently before. He was as a man with mighty tidings,
      and no language: intensely communicative, but inarticulate. Good round
      oaths had formerly compassed and expounded his noble emotions. They were
      now quite beyond the comprehension of blasphemy, even when emphasized, and
      by this the poor lord divinely felt the case was different. There is
      something impressive in a great human hulk writhing under the unutterable
      torments of a mastery he cannot contend with, or account for, or explain
      by means of intelligible words. At first he took refuge in the depths of
      his contempt for women. Cupid gave him line. When he had come to vent his
      worst of them, the fair face now stamped on his brain beamed the more
      triumphantly: so the harpooned whale rose to the surface, and after a few
      convulsions, surrendered his huge length. My lord was in love with
      Richard&rsquo;s young wife. He gave proofs of it by burying himself beside her.
      To her, could she have seen it, he gave further proofs of a real devotion,
      in affecting, and in her presence feeling, nothing beyond a lively
      interest in her well-being. This wonder, that when near her he should be
      cool and composed, and when away from her wrapped in a tempest of desires,
      was matter for what powers of cogitation the heavy nobleman possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hon. Peter, tired of his journeys to and fro, urged him to press the
      business. Lord Mountfalcon was wiser, or more scrupulous, than his
      parasite. Almost every evening he saw Lucy. The inexperienced little wife
      apprehended no harm in his visits. Moreover, Richard had commended her to
      the care of Lord Mountfalcon, and Lady Judith. Lady Judith had left the
      Island for London: Lord Mountfalcon remained. There could be no harm. If
      she had ever thought so, she no longer did. Secretly, perhaps, she was
      flattered. Lord Mountfalcon was as well educated as it is the fortune of
      the run of titled elder sons to be: he could talk and instruct: he was a
      lord: and he let her understand that he was wicked, very wicked, and that
      she improved him. The heroine, in common with the hero, has her ambition
      to be of use in the world&mdash;to do some good: and the task of
      reclaiming a bad man is extremely seductive to good women. Dear to their
      tender bosoms as old china is a bad man they are mending! Lord Mountfalcon
      had none of the arts of a libertine: his gold, his title, and his person
      had hitherto preserved him from having long to sigh in vain, or sigh at
      all, possibly: the Hon. Peter did his villanies for him. No alarm was
      given to Lucy&rsquo;s pure instinct, as might have been the case had my lord
      been over-adept. It was nice in her martyrdom to have a true friend to
      support her, and really to be able to do something for that friend. Too
      simple-minded to think much of his lordship&rsquo;s position, she was yet a
      woman. &ldquo;He, a great nobleman, does not scorn to acknowledge me, and think
      something of me,&rdquo; may have been one of the half-thoughts passing through
      her now and then, as she reflected in self-defence on the proud family she
      had married into.
    </p>
    <p>
      January was watering and freezing old earth by turns, when the Hon. Peter
      travelled down to the sun of his purse with great news. He had no sooner
      broached his lordship&rsquo;s immediate weakness, than Mountfalcon began to
      plunge like a heavy dragoon in difficulties. He swore by this and that he
      had come across an angel for his sins, and would do her no hurt. The next
      moment he swore she must be his, though she cursed like a cat. His
      lordship&rsquo;s illustrations were not choice. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t advanced an inch,&rdquo; he
      groaned. &ldquo;Brayder! upon my soul, that little woman could do anything with
      me. By heaven! I&rsquo;d marry her to-morrow. Here I am, seeing her every day in
      the week out or in, and what do you think she gets me to talk about?&mdash;history!
      Isn&rsquo;t it enough to make a fellow mad? and there am I lecturing like a
      prig, and by heaven! while I&rsquo;m at it I feel a pleasure in it; and when I
      leave the house I should feel an immense gratification in shooting
      somebody. What do they say in town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; said Brayder, significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When&rsquo;s that fellow&mdash;her husband&mdash;coming down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather hope we&rsquo;ve settled him for life, Mount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nobleman and parasite exchanged looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brayder hummed an air, and broke it to say, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in for Don Juan at a
      gallop, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce! Has Bella got him?&rdquo; Mountfalcon asked with eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brayder handed my lord a letter. It was dated from the Sussex coast,
      signed &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; and was worded thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My beautiful Devil&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since we&rsquo;re both devils together, and have found each other out, come to
      me at once, or I shall be going somewhere in a hurry. Come, my bright
      hell-star! I ran away from you, and now I ask you to come to me! You have
      taught me how devils love, and I can&rsquo;t do without you. Come an hour after
      you receive this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mountfalcon turned over the letter to see if there was any more.
      &ldquo;Complimentary love-epistle!&rdquo; he remarked, and rising from his chair and
      striding about, muttered, &ldquo;The dog! how infamously he treats his wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very bad,&rdquo; said Brayder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get hold of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strolled into Belle&rsquo;s dressing-room, waiting for her turned over her
      pincushion hap-hazard. You know her trick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! I think that girl does it on purpose. Thank heaven, I haven&rsquo;t
      written her any letters for an age. Is she going to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not she! But it&rsquo;s odd, Mount!&mdash;did you ever know her refuse money
      before? She tore up the cheque in style, and presented me the fragments
      with two or three of the delicacies of language she learnt at your
      Academy. I rather like to hear a woman swear. It embellishes her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mountfalcon took counsel of his parasite as to the end the letter could be
      made to serve. Both conscientiously agreed that Richard&rsquo;s behaviour to his
      wife was infamous, and that he at least deserved no mercy. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said his
      lordship, &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t do to show the letter. At first she&rsquo;ll be swearing
      it&rsquo;s false, and then she&rsquo;ll stick to him closer. I know the sluts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rule of contrary,&rdquo; said Brayder, carelessly. &ldquo;She must see the
      trahison with her eyes. They believe their eyes. There&rsquo;s your chance,
      Mount. You step in: you give her revenge and consolation&mdash;two birds
      at one shot. That&rsquo;s what they like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an ass, Brayder,&rdquo; the nobleman exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an infernal
      blackguard. You talk of this little woman as if she and other women were
      all of a piece. I don&rsquo;t see anything I gain by this confounded letter. Her
      husband&rsquo;s a brute&mdash;that&rsquo;s clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you leave it to me, Mount?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be damned before I do!&rdquo; muttered my lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Now see how this will end: You&rsquo;re too soft, Mount. You&rsquo;ll be
      made a fool of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, Brayder, there&rsquo;s nothing to be done. If I carry her off&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      been on the point of doing it every day&mdash;what&rsquo;ll come of that? She&rsquo;ll
      look&mdash;I can&rsquo;t stand her eyes&mdash;I shall be a fool&mdash;worse off
      with her than I am now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mountfalcon yawned despondently. &ldquo;And what do you think?&rdquo; he pursued.
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it enough to make a fellow gnash his teeth? She&rsquo;s&rdquo;...he mentioned
      something in an underbreath, and turned red as he said it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; Brayder put up his mouth and rapped the handle of his cane on his
      chin. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s disagreeable, Mount. You don&rsquo;t exactly want to act in that
      character. You haven&rsquo;t got a diploma. Bother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I love her a bit less?&rdquo; broke out my lord in a frenzy. &ldquo;By
      heaven! I&rsquo;d read to her by her bedside, and talk that infernal history to
      her, if it pleased her, all day and all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re evidently graduating for a midwife, Mount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nobleman appeared silently to accept the imputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they say in town?&rdquo; he asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brayder said the sole question was, whether it was maid, wife, or widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to her this evening,&rdquo; Mountfalcon resumed, after&mdash;to judge
      by the cast of his face&mdash;reflecting deeply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to her this
      evening. She shall know what infernal torment she makes me suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say she don&rsquo;t know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t an idea&mdash;thinks me a friend. And so, by heaven! I&rsquo;ll be to
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;hm!&rdquo; went the Honourable Peter. &ldquo;This way to the sign of the
      Green Man, ladies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to be pitched out of the window, Brayder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once was enough, Mount. The Salvage Man is strong. I may have forgotten
      the trick of alighting on my feet. There&mdash;there! I&rsquo;ll be sworn she&rsquo;s
      excessively innocent, and thinks you a disinterested friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to her this evening,&rdquo; Mountfalcon repeated. &ldquo;She shall know what
      damned misery it is to see her in such a position. I can&rsquo;t hold out any
      longer. Deceit&rsquo;s horrible to such a girl as that. I&rsquo;d rather have her
      cursing me than speaking and looking as she does. Dear little girl!&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      only a child. You haven&rsquo;t an idea how sensible that little woman is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; inquired the cunning one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My belief is, Brayder, that there are angels among women,&rdquo; said
      Mountfalcon, evading his parasite&rsquo;s eye as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the world, Lord Mountfalcon was the thoroughly wicked man; his parasite
      simply ingeniously dissipated. Full many a man of God had thought it the
      easier task to reclaim the Hon. Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy received her noble friend by firelight that evening, and sat much in
      the shade. She offered to have the candles brought in. He begged her to
      allow the room to remain as it was. &ldquo;I have something to say to you,&rdquo; he
      observed with a certain solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;to me?&rdquo; said Lucy, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mountfalcon knew he had a great deal to say, but how to say it, and
      what it exactly was, he did not know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You conceal it admirably,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;but you must be very lonely here&mdash;I
      fear, unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have been lonely, but for your kindness, my lord,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;I
      am not unhappy.&rdquo; Her face was in shade and could not belie her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any help that one who would really be your friend might give
      you, Mrs. Feverel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None indeed that I know of,&rdquo; Lucy replied. &ldquo;Who can help us to pay for
      our sins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least you may permit me to endeavour to pay my debts, since you have
      helped me to wash out some of any sins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my lord!&rdquo; said Lucy, not displeased. It is sweet for a woman to
      believe she has drawn the serpent&rsquo;s teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you the truth,&rdquo; Lord Mountfalcon went on. &ldquo;What object could I
      have in deceiving you? I know you quite above flattery&mdash;so different
      from other women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pray, do not say that,&rdquo; interposed Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;According to my experience, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you say you have met such&mdash;such very bad women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have. And now that I meet a good one, it is my misfortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your misfortune, Lord Mountfalcon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I might say more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lordship held impressively mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange men are!&rdquo; thought Lucy. &ldquo;He had some unhappy secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom Bakewell, who had a habit of coming into the room on various pretences
      during the nobleman&rsquo;s visits, put a stop to the revelation, if his
      lordship intended to make any.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were alone again, Lucy said, smiling: &ldquo;Do you know, I am always
      ashamed to ask you to begin to read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mountfalcon stared. &ldquo;To read?&mdash;oh! ha! yes!&rdquo; he remembered his
      evening duties. &ldquo;Very happy, I&rsquo;m sure. Let me see. Where were we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The life of the Emperor Julian. But indeed I feel quite ashamed to ask
      you to read, my lord. It&rsquo;s new to me; like a new world&mdash;hearing about
      Emperors, and armies, and things that really have been on the earth we
      walk upon. It fills my mind. But it must have ceased to interest you, and
      I was thinking that I would not tease you any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pleasure is mine, Mrs. Feverel. &lsquo;Pon my honour, I&rsquo;d read till I was
      hoarse, to hear your remarks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you laughing at me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I look so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Mountfalcon had fine full eyes, and by merely dropping the lids he
      could appear to endow them with mental expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you are not,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;I must thank you for your forbearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nobleman went on his honour loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it was an object of Lucy&rsquo;s to have him reading; for his sake, for her
      sake, and for somebody else&rsquo;s sake; which somebody else was probably
      considered first in the matter. When he was reading to her, he seemed to
      be legitimizing his presence there; and though she had no doubts or
      suspicions whatever, she was easier in her heart while she had him
      employed in that office. So she rose to fetch the book, laid it open on
      the table at his lordship&rsquo;s elbow, and quietly waited to ring for candles
      when he should be willing to commence.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Lord Mountfalcon could not get himself up to the farce, and
      he felt a pity for the strangely innocent unprotected child with anguish
      hanging over her, that withheld the words he wanted to speak, or
      insinuate. He sat silent and did nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I do not like him for,&rdquo; said Lucy, meditatively, &ldquo;is his changing
      his religion. He would have been such a hero, but for that. I could have
      loved him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it you could have loved, Mrs. Feverel?&rdquo; Lord Mountfalcon asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Emperor Julian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the Emperor Julian! Well, he was an apostate but then, you know, he
      meant what he was about. He didn&rsquo;t even do it for a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a woman!&rdquo; cried Lucy. &ldquo;What man would for a woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, Lord Mountfalcon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;d turn Catholic to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make me very unhappy if you say that, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll unsay it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy slightly shuddered. She put her hand upon the bell to ring for
      lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you reject a convert, Mrs. Feverel?&rdquo; said the nobleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes! yes! I do. One who does not give his conscience I would not
      have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he gives his heart and body, can he give more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy&rsquo;s hand pressed the bell. She did not like the doubtful light with one
      who was so unscrupulous. Lord Mountfalcon had never spoken in this way
      before. He spoke better, too. She missed the aristocratic twang in his
      voice, and the hesitation for words, and the fluid lordliness with which
      he rolled over difficulties in speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously with the sounding of the bell the door opened, and
      presented Tom Bakewell. There was a double knock at the same instant at
      the street door. Lucy delayed to give orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be a letter, Tom!&mdash;so late?&rdquo; she said, changing colour. &ldquo;Pray
      run and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That an&rsquo;t powst&rdquo; Tom remarked, as he obeyed his mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you very anxious for a letter, Mrs. Feverel?&rdquo; Lord Mountfalcon
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&mdash;yes, I am, very,&rdquo; said Lucy. Her quick ear caught the tones
      of a voice she remembered. &ldquo;That dear old thing has come to see me,&rdquo; she
      cried, starting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom ushered a bunch of black satin into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Berry!&rdquo; said Lucy, running up to her and kissing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, my darlin&rsquo;!&rdquo; Mrs. Berry, breathless and rosy with her journey,
      returned the salute. &ldquo;Me truly it is, in fault of a better, for I ain&rsquo;t
      one to stand by and give the devil his licence&mdash;roamin&rsquo;! and the salt
      sure enough have spilte my bride-gown at the beginnin&rsquo;, which ain&rsquo;t the
      best sign. Bless ye!&mdash;Oh, here he is.&rdquo; She beheld a male figure in a
      chair by the half light, and swung around to address him. &ldquo;You bad man!&rdquo;
       she held aloft one of her fat fingers, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come on ye like a bolt, I
      have, and goin&rsquo; to make ye do your duty, naughty boy! But your my darlin&rsquo; 
      babe,&rdquo; she melted, as was her custom, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll never meet you and not
      give to ye the kiss of a mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Lord Mountfalcon could find time to expostulate the soft woman had
      him by the neck, and was down among his luxurious whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; She gave a smothered shriek, and fell back. &ldquo;What hair&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom Bakewell just then illumined the transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my gracious!&rdquo; Mrs. Berry breathed with horror, &ldquo;I been and kiss a
      strange man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy, half-laughing, but in dreadful concern, begged the noble lord to
      excuse the woful mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extremely flattered, highly favoured, I&rsquo;m sure;&rdquo; said his lordship,
      re-arranging his disconcerted moustache; &ldquo;may I beg the pleasure of an
      introduction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband&rsquo;s dear old nurse&mdash;Mrs. Berry,&rdquo; said Lucy, taking her hand
      to lend her countenance. &ldquo;Lord Mountfalcon, Mrs. Berry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry sought grace while she performed a series of apologetic bobs,
      and wiped the perspiration from her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy put her into a chair: Lord Mountfalcon asked for an account of her
      passage over to the Island; receiving distressingly full particulars, by
      which it was revealed that the softness of her heart was only equalled by
      the weakness of her stomach. The recital calmed Mrs. Berry down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and where&rsquo;s my&mdash;where&rsquo;s Mr. Richard? yer husband, my dear?&rdquo;
       Mrs. Berry turned from her tale to question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you expect to see him here?&rdquo; said Lucy, in a broken voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where else, my love? since he haven&rsquo;t been seen in London a whole
      fortnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will dismiss the Emperor Julian till to-morrow, I think,&rdquo; said Lord
      Mountfalcon, rising and bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy gave him her hand with mute thanks. He touched it distantly, embraced
      Mrs. Berry in a farewell bow, and was shown out of the house by Tom
      Bakewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he was gone, Mrs. Berry threw up her arms. &ldquo;Did ye ever know
      sich a horrid thing to go and happen to a virtuous woman!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
      &ldquo;I could cry at it, I could! To be goin&rsquo; and kissin&rsquo; a strange hairy man!
      Oh dear me! what&rsquo;s cornin&rsquo; next, I wonder? Whiskers! thinks I&mdash;for I
      know the touch o&rsquo; whiskers&mdash;&lsquo;t ain&rsquo;t like other hair&mdash;what! have
      he growed a crop that sudden, I says to myself; and it flashed on me I
      been and made a awful mistake! and the lights come in, and I see that
      great hairy man&mdash;beggin&rsquo; his pardon&mdash;nobleman, and if I could &lsquo;a
      dropped through the floor out o&rsquo; sight o&rsquo; men, drat &lsquo;em! they&rsquo;re al&rsquo;ays in
      the way, that they are!&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Berry,&rdquo; Lucy checked her, &ldquo;did you expect to find him here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Askin&rsquo; that solemn?&rdquo; retorted Berry. &ldquo;What him? your husband? O&rsquo; course I
      did! and you got him&mdash;somewheres hid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not heard from my husband for fifteen days,&rdquo; said Lucy, and her
      tears rolled heavily off her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not heer from him!&mdash;fifteen days!&rdquo; Berry echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Mrs. Berry! dear kind Mrs. Berry! have you no news? nothing to tell me!
      I&rsquo;ve borne it so long. They&rsquo;re cruel to me, Mrs. Berry. Oh, do you know if
      I have offended him&mdash;my husband? While he wrote I did not complain. I
      could live on his letters for years. But not to hear from him! To think I
      have ruined him, and that he repents! Do they want to take him from me? Do
      they want me dead? O Mrs. Berry! I&rsquo;ve had no one to speak out my heart to
      all this time, and I cannot, cannot help crying, Mrs. Berry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry was inclined to be miserable at what she heard from Lucy&rsquo;s
      lips, and she was herself full of dire apprehension; but it was never this
      excellent creature&rsquo;s system to be miserable in company. The sight of a
      sorrow that was not positive, and could not refer to proof, set her
      resolutely the other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiddle-faddle,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see him repent! He won&rsquo;t find
      anywheres a beauty like his own dear little wife, and he know it. Now,
      look you here, my dear&mdash;you blessed weepin&rsquo; pet&mdash;the man that
      could see ye with that hair of yours there in ruins, and he backed by the
      law, and not rush into your arms and hold ye squeezed for life, he ain&rsquo;t
      got much man in him, I say; and no one can say that of my babe! I was
      sayin&rsquo;, look here, to comfort ye&mdash;oh, why, to be sure he&rsquo;ve got some
      surprise for ye. And so&rsquo;ve I, my lamb! Hark, now! His father&rsquo;ve come to
      town, like a good reasonable man at last, to u-nite ye both, and bring
      your bodies together, as your hearts is, for everlastin&rsquo;. Now ain&rsquo;t that
      news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Lucy, &ldquo;that takes my last hope away. I thought he had gone to
      his father.&rdquo; She burst into fresh tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry paused, disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belike he&rsquo;s travellin&rsquo; after him,&rdquo; she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen days, Mrs. Berry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, fifteen weeks, my dear, after sieh a man as that. He&rsquo;s a regular
      meteor, is Sir Austin Feverel, Raynham Abbey. Well, so hark you here. I
      says to myself, that knows him&mdash;for I did think my babe was in his
      natural nest&mdash;I says, the bar&rsquo;net&rsquo;ll never write for you both to come
      up and beg forgiveness, so down I&rsquo;ll go and fetch you up. For there was
      your mistake, my dear, ever to leave your husband to go away from ye one
      hour in a young marriage. It&rsquo;s dangerous, it&rsquo;s mad, it&rsquo;s wrong, and it&rsquo;s
      only to be righted by your obeyin&rsquo; of me, as I commands it: for I has my
      fits, though I am a soft &lsquo;un. Obey me, and ye&rsquo;ll be happy tomorrow&mdash;or
      the next to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy was willing to see comfort. She was weary of her self-inflicted
      martyrdom, and glad to give herself up to somebody else&rsquo;s guidance
      utterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why does he not write to me, Mrs. Berry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause, &lsquo;cause&mdash;who can tell the why of men, my dear? But that he
      love ye faithful, I&rsquo;ll swear. Haven&rsquo;t he groaned in my arms that he
      couldn&rsquo;t come to ye?&mdash;weak wretch! Hasn&rsquo;t he swore how he loved ye to
      me, poor young man! But this is your fault, my sweet. Yes, it be. You
      should &lsquo;a followed my &lsquo;dvice at the fust&mdash;&lsquo;stead o&rsquo; going into your
      &lsquo;eroics about this and t&rsquo;other.&rdquo; Here Mrs. Berry poured forth fresh
      sentences on matrimony, pointed especially at young couples. &ldquo;I should &lsquo;a
      been a fool if I hadn&rsquo;t suffered myself,&rdquo; she confessed, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;ll thank my
      Berry if I makes you wise in season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy smoothed her ruddy plump cheeks, and gazed up affectionately into the
      soft woman&rsquo;s kind brown eyes. Endearing phrases passed from mouth to
      mouth. And as she gazed Lucy blushed, as one who has something very secret
      to tell, very sweet, very strange, but cannot quite bring herself to speak
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! these&rsquo;s three men in my life I kissed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry, too much
      absorbed in her extraordinary adventure to notice the young wife&rsquo;s
      struggling bosom, &ldquo;three men, and one a nobleman! He&rsquo;ve got more whisker
      than my Berry, I wonder what the man thought. Ten to one he&rsquo;ll think, now,
      I was glad o&rsquo; my chance&mdash;they&rsquo;re that vain, whether they&rsquo;s lords or
      commons. How was I to know? I nat&rsquo;ral thinks none but her husband&rsquo;d sit in
      that chair. Ha! and in the dark? and alone with ye?&rdquo; Mrs. Berry hardened
      her eyes, &ldquo;and your husband away? What do this mean? Tell to me, child,
      what it mean his bein&rsquo; here alone without ere a candle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Mountfalcon is the only friend I have here,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;He is very
      kind. He comes almost every evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Montfalcon&mdash;that his name!&rdquo; Mrs. Berry exclaimed. &ldquo;I been that
      flurried by the man, I didn&rsquo;t mind it at first. He come every evenin&rsquo;, and
      your husband out o&rsquo; sight! My goodness me! it&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; worse and worse.
      And what do he come for, now, ma&rsquo;am? Now tell me candid what ye do
      together here in the dark of an evenin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry glanced severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Mrs. Berry! please not to speak in that way&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo;
       said Lucy, pouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do he come for, I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he is kind, Mrs. Berry. He sees me very lonely, and wishes to
      amuse me. And he tells me of things I know nothing about and&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wants to be a-teachin&rsquo; some of his things, mayhap,&rdquo; Mrs. Berry
      interrupted with a ruffled breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a very ungenerous, suspicious, naughty old woman,&rdquo; said Lucy,
      chiding her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re a silly, unsuspectin&rsquo; little bird,&rdquo; Mrs. Berry retorted, as
      she returned her taps on the cheek. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told me what ye do
      together, and what&rsquo;s his excuse for comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Mrs. Berry, almost every evening that he comes we read
      History, and he explains the battles, and talks to me about the great men.
      And he says I&rsquo;m not silly, Mrs. Berry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one bit o&rsquo; lime on your wings, my bird. History, indeed! History
      to a young married lovely woman alone in the dark! a pretty History! Why,
      I know that man&rsquo;s name, my dear. He&rsquo;s a notorious living rake, that Lord
      Montfalcon. No woman&rsquo;s safe with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but he hasn&rsquo;t deceived me, Mrs. Berry. He has not pretended he was
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More&rsquo;s his art,&rdquo; quoth the experienced dame. &ldquo;So you read History
      together in the dark; my dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was unwell to-night, Mrs. Berry. I wanted him not to see my face. Look!
      there&rsquo;s the book open ready for him when the candles come in. And now, you
      dear kind darling old thing, let me kiss you for coming to me. I do love
      you. Talk of other things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we will,&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry softening to Lucy&rsquo;s caresses. &ldquo;So let us. A
      nobleman, indeed, alone with a young wife in the dark, and she sich a
      beauty! I say this shall be put a stop to now and henceforth, on the spot
      it shall! He won&rsquo;t meneuvele Bessy Berry with his arts. There! I drop him.
      I&rsquo;m dyin&rsquo; for a cup o&rsquo; tea, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy got up to ring the bell, and as Mrs. Berry, incapable of quite
      dropping him, was continuing to say: &ldquo;Let him go and boast I kiss him; he
      ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to be &lsquo;shamed of in a chaste woman&rsquo;s kiss&mdash;unawares&mdash;which
      men don&rsquo;t get too often in their lives, I can assure &lsquo;em;&rdquo;&mdash;her eye
      surveyed Lucy&rsquo;s figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lo, when Lucy returned to her, Mrs. Berry surrounded her with her arms,
      and drew her into feminine depths. &ldquo;Oh, you blessed!&rdquo; she cried in most
      meaning tone, &ldquo;you good, lovin&rsquo;, proper little wife, you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Mrs. Berry!&rdquo; lisps Lucy, opening the most innocent blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if I couldn&rsquo;t see, you pet! It was my flurry blinded me, or I&rsquo;d &lsquo;a
      marked ye the fast shock. Thinkin&rsquo; to deceive me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s eyes spoke generations. Lucy&rsquo;s wavered; she coloured all
      over, and hid her face on the bounteous breast that mounted to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a sweet one,&rdquo; murmured the soft woman, patting her back, and
      rocking her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a rose, you are! and a bud on your stalk. Haven&rsquo;t
      told a word to your husband, my dear?&rdquo; she asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy shook her head, looking sly and shy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We&rsquo;ll give him a surprise; let it come all at once on him,
      and thinks he&mdash;losin&rsquo; breath &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a father!&rsquo; Nor a hint even you
      haven&rsquo;t give him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy kissed her, to indicate it was quite a secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you are a sweet one,&rdquo; said Bessy Berry, and rocked her more closely
      and lovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then these two had a whispered conversation, from which let all of male
      persuasion retire a space nothing under one mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning, after a due interval, we see Mrs. Berry counting on her
      fingers&rsquo; ends. Concluding the sum, she cries prophetically: &ldquo;Now this
      right everything&mdash;a baby in the balance! Now I say this angel-infant
      come from on high. It&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s messenger, my love! and it&rsquo;s not wrong to
      say so. He thinks you worthy, or you wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;a had one&mdash;not for all
      the tryin&rsquo; in the world, you wouldn&rsquo;t, and some tries hard enough, poor
      creatures! Now let us rejice and make merry! I&rsquo;m for cryin&rsquo; and laughin&rsquo;,
      one and the same. This is the blessed seal of matrimony, which Berry never
      stamp on me. It&rsquo;s be hoped it&rsquo;s a boy. Make that man a grandfather, and
      his grandchild a son, and you got him safe. Oh! this is what I call
      happiness, and I&rsquo;ll have my tea a little stronger in consequence. I
      declare I could get tipsy to know this joyful news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Mrs. Berry carolled. She had her tea a little stronger. She ate and she
      drank; she rejoiced and made merry. The bliss of the chaste was hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Says Lucy demurely: &ldquo;Now you know why I read History, and that sort of
      books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; replies Berry. &ldquo;Belike I do. Since what you done&rsquo;s so good, my
      darlin&rsquo;, I&rsquo;m agreeable to anything. A fig for all the lords! They can&rsquo;t
      come anigh a baby. You may read Voyages and Travels, my dear, and
      Romances, and Tales of Love and War. You cut the riddle in your own dear
      way, and that&rsquo;s all I cares for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but you don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; persists Lucy. &ldquo;I only read sensible
      books, and talk of serious things, because I&rsquo;m sure... because I have
      heard say...dear Mrs. Berry! don&rsquo;t you understand now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry smacked her knees. &ldquo;Only to think of her bein&rsquo; that thoughtful!
      and she a Catholic, too! Never tell me that people of one religion ain&rsquo;t
      as good as another, after that. Why, you want to make him a historian, to
      be sure! And that rake of a lord who&rsquo;ve been comin&rsquo; here playin&rsquo; at wolf,
      you been and made him&mdash;unbeknown to himself&mdash;sort o&rsquo; tutor to
      the unborn blessed! Ha! ha! say that little women ain&rsquo;t got art ekal to
      the cunningest of &lsquo;em. Oh! I understand. Why, to be sure, didn&rsquo;t I know a
      lady, a widow of a clergyman: he was a postermost child, and afore his
      birth that women read nothin&rsquo; but Blair&rsquo;s &lsquo;Grave&rsquo; over and over again,
      from the end to the beginnin&rsquo;;&mdash;that&rsquo;s a serious book!&mdash;very
      hard readin&rsquo;!&mdash;and at four years of age that child that come of it
      reelly was the piousest infant!&mdash;he was like a little curate. His
      eyes was up; he talked so solemn.&rdquo; Mrs. Berry imitated the little curate&rsquo;s
      appearance and manner of speaking. &ldquo;So she got her wish, for one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at this lady Lucy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They chattered on happily till bedtime. Lucy arranged for Mrs. Berry to
      sleep with her. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not dreadful to ye, my sweet, sleepin&rsquo; beside a
      woman,&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry. &ldquo;I know it were to me shortly after my Berry, and
      I felt it. It don&rsquo;t somehow seem nat&rsquo;ral after matrimony&mdash;a woman in
      your bed! I was obliged to have somebody, for the cold sheets do give ye
      the creeps when you&rsquo;ve been used to that that&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upstairs they went together, Lucy not sharing these objections. Then Lucy
      opened certain drawers, and exhibited pretty caps, and laced linen, all
      adapted for a very small body, all the work of her own hands: and Mrs.
      Berry praised them and her. &ldquo;You been guessing a boy&mdash;woman-like,&rdquo;
       she said. Then they cooed, and kissed, and undressed by the fire, and
      knelt at the bedside, with their arms about each other, praying; both
      praying for the unborn child; and Mrs. Berry pressed Lucy&rsquo;s waist the
      moment she was about to breathe the petition to heaven to shield and bless
      that coming life; and thereat Lucy closed to her, and felt a strong love
      for her. Then Lucy got into bed first, leaving Berry to put out the light,
      and before she did so, Berry leaned over her, and eyed her roguishly,
      saying, &ldquo;I never see ye like this, but I&rsquo;m half in love with ye myself,
      you blushin&rsquo; beauty! Sweet&rsquo;s your eyes, and your hair do take one so&mdash;lyin&rsquo; 
      back. I&rsquo;d never forgive my father if he kep me away from ye
      four-and-twenty hours just. Husband o&rsquo; that!&rdquo; Berry pointed at the young
      wife&rsquo;s loveliness. &ldquo;Ye look so ripe with kisses, and there they are
      a-languishin&rsquo;!&mdash;... You never look so but in your bed, ye beauty!&mdash;just
      as it ought to be.&rdquo; Lucy had to pretend to rise to put out the light
      before Berry would give up her amorous chaste soliloquy. Then they lay in
      bed, and Mrs. Berry fondled her, and arranged for their departure
      to-morrow, and reviewed Richard&rsquo;s emotions when he came to hear he was
      going to be made a father by her, and hinted at Lucy&rsquo;s delicious shivers
      when Richard was again in his rightful place, which she, Bessy Berry, now
      usurped; and all sorts of amorous sweet things; enough to make one fancy
      the adage subverted, that stolen fruits are sweetest; she drew such
      glowing pictures of bliss within the law and the limits of the conscience,
      till at last, worn out, Lucy murmured &ldquo;Peepy, dear Berry,&rdquo; and the soft
      woman gradually ceased her chirp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bessy Berry did not sleep. She lay thinking of the sweet brave heart
      beside her, and listening to Lucy&rsquo;s breath as it came and went; squeezing
      the fair sleeper&rsquo;s hand now and then, to ease her love as her reflections
      warmed. A storm of wind came howling over the Hampshire hills, and sprang
      white foam on the water, and shook the bare trees. It passed, leaving a
      thin cloth of snow on the wintry land. The moon shone brilliantly. Berry
      heard the house-dog bark. His bark was savage and persistent. She was
      roused by the noise. By and by she fancied she heard a movement in the
      house; then it seemed to her that the house-door opened. She cocked her
      ears, and could almost make out voices in the midnight stillness. She
      slipped from the bed, locked and bolted the door of the room, assured
      herself of Lucy&rsquo;s unconsciousness, and went on tiptoe to the window. The
      trees all stood white to the north; the ground glittered; the cold was
      keen. Berry wrapped her fat arms across her bosom, and peeped as close
      over into the garden as the situation of the window permitted. Berry was a
      soft, not a timid, woman: and it happened this night that her thoughts
      were above the fears of the dark. She was sure of the voices; curiosity
      without a shade of alarm held her on the watch; and gathering bundles of
      her day-apparel round her neck and shoulders, she silenced the chattering
      of her teeth as well as she could, and remained stationary. The low hum of
      the voices came to a break; something was said in a louder tone; the
      house-door quietly shut; a man walked out of the garden into the road. He
      paused opposite her window, and Berry let the blind go back to its place,
      and peeped from behind an edge of it. He was in the shadow of the house,
      so that it was impossible to discern much of his figure. After some
      minutes he walked rapidly away, and Berry returned to the bed an icicle,
      from which Lucy&rsquo;s limbs sensitively shrank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Mrs. Berry asked Tom Bakewell if he had been disturbed in the
      night. Tom, the mysterious, said he had slept like a top. Mrs. Berry went
      into the garden. The snow was partially melted; all save one spot, just
      under the portal, and there she saw the print of a man&rsquo;s foot. By some
      strange guidance it occurred to her to go and find one of Richard&rsquo;s boots.
      She did so, and, unperceived, she measured the sole of the boot in that
      solitary footmark. There could be no doubt that it fitted. She tried it
      from heel to toe a dozen times.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sir Austin Feverel had come to town with the serenity of a philosopher who
      says, &lsquo;Tis now time; and the satisfaction of a man who has not arrived
      thereat without a struggle. He had almost forgiven his son. His deep love
      for him had well-nigh shaken loose from wounded pride and more tenacious
      vanity. Stirrings of a remote sympathy for the creature who had robbed him
      of his son and hewed at his System, were in his heart of hearts. This he
      knew; and in his own mind he took credit for his softness. But the world
      must not suppose him soft; the world must think he was still acting on his
      System. Otherwise what would his long absence signify?&mdash;Something
      highly unphilosophical. So, though love was strong, and was moving him to
      a straightforward course, the last tug of vanity drew him still aslant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Aphorist read himself so well, that to juggle with himself was a
      necessity. As he wished the world to see him, he beheld himself: one who
      entirely put aside mere personal feelings: one in whom parental duty,
      based on the science of life, was paramount: a Scientific Humanist, in
      short.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, therefore, rather surprised at a coldness in Lady Blandish&rsquo;s
      manner when he did appear. &ldquo;At last!&rdquo; said the lady, in a sad way that
      sounded reproachfully. Now the Scientific Humanist had, of course, nothing
      to reproach himself with.
    </p>
    <p>
      But where was Richard?
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian positively averred he was not with his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he had gone,&rdquo; said the baronet, &ldquo;he would have anticipated me by a few
      hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, when repeated to Lady Blandish, should have propitiated her, and
      shown his great forgiveness. She, however, sighed, and looked at him
      wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their converse was not happy and deeply intimate. Philosophy did not seem
      to catch her mind; and fine phrases encountered a rueful assent, more
      flattering to their grandeur than to their influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Days went by. Richard did not present himself. Sir Austin&rsquo;s pitch of
      self-command was to await the youth without signs of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing this, the lady told him her fears for Richard, and mentioned the
      rumour of him that was about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If,&rdquo; said the baronet, &ldquo;this person, his wife, is what you paint her, I
      do not share your fears for him. I think too well of him. If she is one to
      inspire the sacredness of that union, I think too well of him. It is
      impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady saw one thing to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call her to you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Have her with you at Raynham. Recognize her.
      It is the disunion and doubt that so confuses him and drives him wild. I
      confess to you I hoped he had gone to her. It seems not. If she is with
      you his way will be clear. Will you do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Science is notoriously of slow movement. Lady Blandish&rsquo;s proposition was
      far too hasty for Sir Austin. Women, rapid by nature, have no idea of
      science.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see her there in time, Emmeline. At present let it be between me
      and my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke loftily. In truth it offended him to be asked to do anything,
      when he had just brought himself to do so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      A month elapsed, and Richard appeared on the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting between him and his father was not what his father had
      expected and had crooned over in the Welsh mountains. Richard shook his
      hand respectfully, and inquired after his health with the common social
      solicitude. He then said: &ldquo;During your absence, sir, I have taken the
      liberty, without consulting you, to do something in which you are more
      deeply concerned than myself. I have taken upon myself to find out my
      mother and place her under my care. I trust you will not think I have done
      wrong. I acted as I thought best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin replied: &ldquo;You are of an age, Richard, to judge for yourself in
      such a case. I would have you simply beware of deceiving yourself in
      imagining that you considered any one but yourself in acting as you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not deceived myself, sir,&rdquo; said Richard, and the interview was
      over. Both hated an exposure of the feelings, and in that both were
      satisfied: but the baronet, as one who loves, hoped and looked for tones
      indicative of trouble and delight in the deep heart; and Richard gave him
      none of those. The young man did not even face him as he spoke: if their
      eyes met by chance, Richard&rsquo;s were defiantly cold. His whole bearing was
      changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This rash marriage has altered him,&rdquo; said the very just man of science in
      life: and that meant: &ldquo;it has debased him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pursued his reflections. &ldquo;I see in him the desperate maturity of a
      suddenly-ripened nature: and but for my faith that good work is never
      lost, what should I think of the toil of my years? Lost, perhaps to me!
      lost to him! It may show itself in his children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Philosopher, we may conceive, has contentment in benefiting embryos:
      but it was a somewhat bitter prospect to Sir Austin. Bitterly he felt the
      injury to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      One little incident spoke well of Richard. A poor woman called at the
      hotel while he was missing. The baronet saw her, and she told him a tale
      that threw Christian light on one part of Richard&rsquo;s nature. But this might
      gratify the father in Sir Austin; it did not touch the man of science. A
      Feverel, his son, would not do less, he thought. He sat down deliberately
      to study his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      No definite observations enlightened him. Richard ate and drank; joked and
      laughed. He was generally before Adrian in calling for a fresh bottle. He
      talked easily of current topics; his gaiety did not sound forced. In all
      he did, nevertheless, there was not the air of a youth who sees a future
      before him. Sir Austin put that down. It might be carelessness, and wanton
      blood, for no one could say he had much on his mind. The man of science
      was not reckoning that Richard also might have learned to act and wear a
      mask. Dead subjects&mdash;this is to say, people not on their guard&mdash;he
      could penetrate and dissect. It is by a rare chance, as scientific men
      well know, that one has an opportunity of examining the structure of the
      living.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, that rare chance was granted to Sir Austin. They were engaged to
      dine with Mrs. Doria at the Foreys&rsquo;, and walked down to her in the
      afternoon, father and son arm-in-arm, Adrian beside them. Previously the
      offended father had condescended to inform his son that it would shortly
      be time for him to return to his wife, indicating that arrangements would
      ultimately be ordered to receive her at Raynham. Richard had replied
      nothing; which might mean excess of gratitude, or hypocrisy in concealing
      his pleasure, or any one of the thousand shifts by which gratified human
      nature expresses itself when all is made to run smooth with it. Now Mrs.
      Berry had her surprise ready charged for the young husband. She had Lucy
      in her own house waiting for him. Every day she expected him to call and
      be overcome by the rapturous surprise, and every day, knowing his habit of
      frequenting the park, she marched Lucy thither, under the plea that Master
      Richard, whom she had already christened, should have an airing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The round of the red winter sun was behind the bare Kensington chestnuts,
      when these two parties met. Happily for Lucy and the hope she bore in her
      bosom, she was perversely admiring a fair horsewoman galloping by at the
      moment. Mrs. Berry plucked at her gown once or twice, to prepare her eyes
      for the shock, but Lucy&rsquo;s head was still half averted, and thinks Mrs.
      Berry, &ldquo;Twon&rsquo;t hurt her if she go into his arms head foremost.&rdquo; They were
      close; Mrs. Berry performed the bob preliminary. Richard held her silent
      with a terrible face; he grasped her arm, and put her behind him. Other
      people intervened. Lucy saw nothing to account for Berry&rsquo;s excessive
      flutter. Berry threw it on the air and some breakfast bacon, which, she
      said, she knew in the morning while she ate it, was bad for the bile, and
      which probably was the cause of her bursting into tears, much to Lucy&rsquo;s
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you ate makes you cry, Mrs. Berry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Berry pressed at her heart and leaned sideways,
      &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all stomach, my dear. Don&rsquo;t ye mind,&rdquo; and becoming aware of her
      unfashionable behaviour, she trailed off to the shelter of the elms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a singular manner with old ladies,&rdquo; said Sir Austin to his son,
      after Berry had been swept aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely courteous. She behaved like a mad woman, certainly.&rdquo;&mdash;Are
      you ill, my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard was death-pale, his strong form smitten through with weakness. The
      baronet sought Adrian&rsquo;s eye. Adrian had seen Lucy as they passed, and he
      had a glimpse of Richard&rsquo;s countenance while disposing of Berry. Had Lucy
      recognized them, he would have gone to her unhesitatingly. As she did not,
      he thought it well, under the circumstances, to leave matters as they
      were. He answered the baronet&rsquo;s look with a shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ill, Richard?&rdquo; Sir Austin again asked his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, sir! come on!&rdquo; cried Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father&rsquo;s further meditations, as they stepped briskly to the Foreys&rsquo;,
      gave poor ferry a character which one who lectures on matrimony, and has
      kissed but three men in her life, shrieks to hear the very title of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard will go to his wife to-morrow,&rdquo; Sir Austin said to Adrian some
      time before they went in to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian asked him if he had chanced to see a young fair-haired lady by the
      side of the old one Richard had treated so peculiarly; and to the
      baronet&rsquo;s acknowledgment that he remembered to have observed such a
      person, Adrian said: &ldquo;That was his wife, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin could not dissect the living subject. As if a bullet had torn
      open the young man&rsquo;s skull, and some blast of battle laid his palpitating
      organization bare, he watched every motion of his brain and his heart; and
      with the grief and terror of one whose mental habit was ever to pierce to
      extremes. Not altogether conscious that he had hitherto played with life,
      he felt that he was suddenly plunged into the stormful reality of it. He
      projected to speak plainly to his son on all points that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard is very gay,&rdquo; Mrs. Doris, whispered her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All will be right with him to-morrow,&rdquo; he replied; for the game had been
      in his hands so long, so long had he been the God of the machine, that
      having once resolved to speak plainly and to act, he was to a certain
      extent secure, bad as the thing to mend might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I notice he has rather a wild laugh&mdash;I don&rsquo;t exactly like his eyes,&rdquo;
       said Mrs. Doria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see a change in him to-morrow,&rdquo; the man of science remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was reserved for Mrs. Doria herself to experience that change. In the
      middle of the dinner a telegraphic message from her son-in-law, worthy
      John Todhunter, reached the house, stating that Clare was alarmingly ill,
      bidding her come instantly. She cast about for some one to accompany her,
      and fixed on Richard. Before he would give his consent for Richard to go,
      Sir Austin desired to speak with him apart, and in that interview he said
      to his son: &ldquo;My dear Richard! it was my intention that we should come to
      an understanding together this night. But the time is short&mdash;poor
      Helen cannot spare many minutes. Let me then say that you deceived me, and
      that I forgive you. We fix our seal on the past. You will bring your wife
      to me when you return.&rdquo; And very cheerfully the baronet looked down on the
      generous future he thus founded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you have her at Raynham at once, sir?&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my son, when you bring her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mocking me, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you to receive her at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! the delay cannot be long. I do not apprehend that you will be kept
      from your happiness many days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it will be some time, sir!&rdquo; said Richard, sighing deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what mental freak is this that can induce you to postpone it and play
      with your first duty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is my first duty, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you are married, to be with your wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard that from an old woman called Berry!&rdquo; said Richard to
      himself, not intending irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you receive her at once?&rdquo; he asked resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baronet was clouded by his son&rsquo;s reception of his graciousness. His
      grateful prospect had formerly been Richard&rsquo;s marriage&mdash;the
      culmination of his System. Richard had destroyed his participation in
      that. He now looked for a pretty scene in recompense:&mdash;Richard
      leading up his wife to him, and both being welcomed by him paternally, and
      so held one ostentatious minute in his embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: &ldquo;Before you return, I demur to receiving her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; replied his son, and stood as if he had spoken all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really you tempt me to fancy you already regret your rash proceeding!&rdquo;
       the baronet exclaimed; and the next moment it pained him he had uttered
      the words, Richard&rsquo;s eyes were so sorrowfully fierce. It pained him, but
      he divined in that look a history, and he could not refrain from glancing
      acutely and asking: &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Regret it, sir?&rdquo; The question aroused one of those struggles in the young
      man&rsquo;s breast which a passionate storm of tears may still, and which sink
      like leaden death into the soul when tears come not. Richard&rsquo;s eyes had
      the light of the desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; his father repeated. &ldquo;You tempt me&mdash;I almost fear you do.&rdquo;
       At the thought&mdash;for he expressed his mind&mdash;the pity that he had
      for Richard was not pure gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask me what I think of her, sir! Ask me what she is! Ask me what it is to
      have taken one of God&rsquo;s precious angels and chained her to misery! Ask me
      what it is to have plunged a sword into her heart, and to stand over her
      and see such a creature bleeding! Do I regret that? Why, yes, I do! Would
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes flew hard at his father under the ridge of his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin winced and reddened. Did he understand? There is ever in the
      mind&rsquo;s eye a certain wilfulness. We see and understand; we see and won&rsquo;t
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me why you passed by her as you did this afternoon,&rdquo; he said
      gravely: and in the same voice Richard answered: &ldquo;I passed her because I
      could not do otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wife, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! my wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she had seen you, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God spared her that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doria, bustling in practical haste, and bearing Richard&rsquo;s hat and
      greatcoat in her energetic hands, came between them at this juncture.
      Dimples of commiseration were in her cheeks while she kissed her brother&rsquo;s
      perplexed forehead. She forgot her trouble about Clare, deploring his
      fatuity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin was forced to let his son depart. As of old, he took counsel
      with Adrian, and the wise youth was soothing. &ldquo;Somebody has kissed him,
      sir, and the chaste boy can&rsquo;t get over it.&rdquo; This absurd suggestion did
      more to appease the baronet than if Adrian had given a veritable
      reasonable key to Richard&rsquo;s conduct. It set him thinking that it might be
      a prudish strain in the young man&rsquo;s mind, due to the System in
      difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may have been wrong in one thing,&rdquo; he said, with an air of the utmost
      doubt of it. &ldquo;I, perhaps, was wrong in allowing him so much liberty during
      his probation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian pointed out to him that he had distinctly commanded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; that is on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His was an order of mind that would accept the most burdensome charges,
      and by some species of moral usury make a profit out of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare was little talked of. Adrian attributed the employment of the
      telegraph to John Todhunter&rsquo;s uxorious distress at a toothache, or
      possibly the first symptoms of an heir to his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That child&rsquo;s mind has disease in it... She is not sound,&rdquo; said the
      baronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the door-step of the hotel, when they returned, stood Mrs. Berry. Her
      wish to speak a few words with the baronet reverentially communicated, she
      was ushered upstairs into his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry compressed her person in the chair she was beckoned to occupy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rsquo; ma&rsquo;am, you have something to say,&rdquo; observed the baronet, for she
      seemed loth to commence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wishin&rsquo; I hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Berry took him up, and mindful of the good
      rule to begin at the beginning, pursued: &ldquo;I dare say, Sir Austin, you
      don&rsquo;t remember me, and I little thought when last we parted our meeting &lsquo;d
      be like this. Twenty year don&rsquo;t go over one without showin&rsquo; it, no more
      than twenty ox. It&rsquo;s a might o&rsquo; time,&mdash;twenty year! Leastways not
      quite twenty, it ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Round figures are best,&rdquo; Adrian remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In them round figures a be-loved son have growed up, and got himself
      married!&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry, diving straight into the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin then learnt that he had before him the culprit who had assisted
      his son in that venture. It was a stretch of his patience to hear himself
      addressed on a family matter; but he was naturally courteous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came to my house, Sir Austin, a stranger! If twenty year alters us as
      have knowed each other on the earth, how must they alter they that we
      parted with just come from heaven! And a heavenly babe he were! so sweet!
      so strong! so fat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry bumped a curtsey to him in her chair, continuing: &ldquo;I wished
      afore I spoke to say how thankful am I bound to be for my pension not cut
      short, as have offended so, but that I know Sir Austin Feverel, Raynham
      Abbey, ain&rsquo;t one o&rsquo; them that likes to hear their good deeds pumlished.
      And a pension to me now, it&rsquo;s something more than it were. For a pension
      and pretty rosy cheeks in a maid, which I was&mdash;that&rsquo;s a bait many a
      man&rsquo;ll bite, that won&rsquo;t so a forsaken wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will speak to the point, ma&rsquo;am, I will listen to you,&rdquo; the baronet
      interrupted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the beginnin&rsquo; that&rsquo;s the worst, and that&rsquo;s over, thank the Lord! So
      I&rsquo;ll speak, Sir Austin, and say my say:&mdash;Lord speed me! Believin&rsquo; our
      idees o&rsquo; matrimony to be sim&rsquo;lar, then, I&rsquo;ll say, once married&mdash;married
      for life! Yes! I don&rsquo;t even like widows. For I can&rsquo;t stop at the grave.
      Not at the tomb I can&rsquo;t stop. My husband&rsquo;s my husband, and if I&rsquo;m a body
      at the Resurrection, I say, speaking humbly, my Berry is the husband o&rsquo; my
      body; and to think of two claimin&rsquo; of me then&mdash;it makes me hot all
      over. Such is my notion of that state &lsquo;tween man and woman. No givin&rsquo; in
      marriage, o&rsquo; course I know; and if so I&rsquo;m single.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baronet suppressed a smile. &ldquo;Really, my good woman, you wander very
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beggin&rsquo; pardon, Sir Austin; but I has my point before me all the same,
      and I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo; to it. Ac-knowledgin&rsquo; our error, it&rsquo;d done, and bein&rsquo; done,
      it&rsquo;s writ aloft. Oh! if you ony knew what a sweet young creature she be!
      Indeed; &lsquo;taint all of humble birth that&rsquo;s unworthy, Sir Austin. And she
      got her idees, too: She reads History! She talk that sensible as would
      surprise ye. But for all that she&rsquo;s a prey to the artful o&rsquo; men&mdash;unpertected.
      And it&rsquo;s a young marriage&mdash;but there&rsquo;s no fear for her, as far as she
      go. The fear&rsquo;s t&rsquo;other way. There&rsquo;s that in a man&mdash;at the
      commencement&mdash;which make of him Lord knows what if you any way
      interferes: whereas a woman bides quiet! It&rsquo;s consolation catch her, which
      is what we mean by seduein&rsquo;. Whereas a man&mdash;he&rsquo;s a savage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin turned his face to Adrian, who was listening with huge delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, I see you have something in your mind, if you would only
      come to it quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then here&rsquo;s my point, Sir Austin. I say you bred him so as there ain&rsquo;t
      another young gentleman like him in England, and proud he make me. And as
      for her, I&rsquo;ll risk sayin&rsquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s done, and no harm&mdash;you might
      search England through, and nowhere will ye find a maid that&rsquo;s his match
      like his own wife. Then there they be. Are they together as should be? O
      Lord no! Months they been divided. Then she all lonely and exposed, I
      went, and fetched her out of seducers&rsquo; ways&mdash;which they may say what
      they like, but the inn&rsquo;cent is most open to when they&rsquo;re healthy and
      confidin&rsquo;&mdash;I fetch her, and&mdash;the liberty&mdash;boxed her safe in
      my own house. So much for that sweet! That you may do with women. But it&rsquo;s
      him&mdash;Mr. Richard&mdash;I am bold, I know, but there&mdash;I&rsquo;m in for
      it, and the Lord&rsquo;ll help me! It&rsquo;s him, Sir Austin, in this great
      metropolis, warm from a young marriage. It&rsquo;s him, and&mdash;I say nothin&rsquo; 
      of her, and how sweet she bears it, and it&rsquo;s eating her at a time when
      Natur&rsquo; should have no other trouble but the one that&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on it&rsquo;s him,
      and I ask&mdash;so bold&mdash;shall there&mdash;and a Christian gentlemen
      his father&mdash;shall there be a tug &lsquo;tween him as a son and him as a
      husband&mdash;soon to be somethin&rsquo; else? I speak bold out&mdash;I&rsquo;d have
      sons obey their fathers, but a priest&rsquo;s words spoke over them, which
      they&rsquo;re now in my ears, I say I ain&rsquo;t a doubt on earth&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure
      there ain&rsquo;t one in heaven&mdash;which dooty&rsquo;s the holier of the two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin heard her to an end. Their views on the junction of the sexes
      were undoubtedly akin. To be lectured on his prime subject, however, was
      slightly disagreeable, and to be obliged mentally to assent to this old
      lady&rsquo;s doctrine was rather humiliating, when it could not be averred that
      he had latterly followed it out. He sat cross-legged and silent, a finger
      to his temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One gets so addle-gated thinkin&rsquo; many things,&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry, simply.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we see wonder clever people goin&rsquo; wrong&mdash;to my mind. I
      think it&rsquo;s al&rsquo;ays the plan in a dielemmer to pray God and walk forward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The keen-witted soft woman was tracking the baronet&rsquo;s thoughts, and she
      had absolutely run him down and taken an explanation out of his mouth, by
      which Mrs. Berry was to have been informed that he had acted from a
      principle of his own, and devolved a wisdom she could not be expected to
      comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course he became advised immediately that it would be waste of time to
      direct such an explanation to her inferior capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave her his hand, saying, &ldquo;My son has gone out of town to see his
      cousin, who is ill. He will return in two or three days, and then they
      will both come to me at Raynham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry took the tips of his fingers, and went half-way to the floor
      perpendicularly. &ldquo;He pass her like a stranger in the park this evenin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
       she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; said the baronet. &ldquo;Yes, well! they will be at Raynham before the
      week is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry was not quite satisfied. &ldquo;Not of his own accord he pass that
      sweet young wife of his like a stranger this day, Sir Austin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must beg you not to intrude further, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry bobbed her bunch of a body out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well that ends well,&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just bad inquirin&rsquo; 
      too close among men. We must take &lsquo;em somethin&rsquo; like Providence&mdash;as
      they come. Thank heaven! I kep&rsquo; back the baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s eyes the baby was the victorious reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adrian asked his chief what he thought of that specimen of woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have not met a better in my life,&rdquo; said the baronet, mingling
      praise and sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare lies in her bed as placid as in the days when she breathed; her
      white hands stretched their length along the sheets, at peace from head to
      feet. She needs iron no more. Richard is face to face with death for the
      first time. He sees the sculpture of clay&mdash;the spark gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare gave her mother the welcome of the dead. This child would have
      spoken nothing but kind commonplaces had she been alive. She was dead, and
      none knew her malady. On her fourth finger were two wedding-rings.
    </p>
    <p>
      When hours of weeping had silenced the mother&rsquo;s anguish, she, for some
      comfort she saw in it, pointed out that strange thing to Richard, speaking
      low in the chamber of the dead; and then he learnt that it was his own
      lost ring Clare wore in the two worlds. He learnt from her husband that
      Clare&rsquo;s last request had been that neither of the rings should be removed.
      She had written it; she would not speak it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg of my husband, and all kind people who may have the care of me
      between this and the grave, to bury me with my hands untouched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tracing of the words showed the bodily torment she was suffering, as
      she wrote them on a scrap of paper found beside her pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In wonder, as the dim idea grew from the waving of Clare&rsquo;s dead hand,
      Richard paced the house, and hung about the awful room; dreading to enter
      it, reluctant to quit it. The secret Clare had buried while she lived,
      arose with her death. He saw it play like flame across her marble
      features. The memory of her voice was like a knife at his nerves. His
      coldness to her started up accusingly: her meekness was bitter blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the fourth day, her mother came to him in his bedroom,
      with a face so white that he asked himself if aught worse could happen to
      a mother than the loss of her child. Choking she said to him, &ldquo;Read this,&rdquo;
       and thrust a leather-bound pocket-book trembling in his hand. She would
      not breathe to him what it was. She entreated him not to open it before
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;tell me what you think. John must not hear of it. I
      have nobody to consult but you O Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Diary&rdquo; was written in the round hand of Clare&rsquo;s childhood on the first
      page. The first name his eye encountered was his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard&rsquo;s fourteenth birthday. I have worked him a purse and put it under
      his pillow, because he is going to have plenty of money. He does not
      notice me now because he has a friend now, and he is ugly, but Richard is
      not, and never will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The occurrences of that day were subsequently recorded, and a childish
      prayer to God for him set down. Step by step he saw her growing mind in
      his history. As she advanced in years she began to look back, and made
      much of little trivial remembrances, all bearing upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We went into the fields and gathered cowslips together, and pelted each
      other, and I told him he used to call them &lsquo;coals-sleeps&rsquo; when he was a
      baby, and he was angry at my telling him, for he does not like to be told
      he was ever a baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He remembered the incident, and remembered his stupid scorn of her meek
      affection. Little Clare! how she lived before him in her white dress and
      pink ribbons, and soft dark eyes! Upstairs she was lying dead. He read on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mama says there is no one in the world like Richard, and I am sure there
      is not, not in the whole world. He says he is going to be a great General
      and going to the wars. If he does I shall dress myself as a boy and go
      after him, and he will not know me till I am wounded. Oh I pray he will
      never, never be wounded. I wonder what I should feel if Richard was ever
      to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upstairs Clare was lying dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Blandish said there was a likeness between Richard and me. Richard
      said I hope I do not hang down my head as she does. He is angry with me
      because I do not look people in the face and speak out, but I know I am
      not looking after earthworms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes. He had told her that. A shiver seized him at the recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it came to a period when the words: &ldquo;Richard kissed me,&rdquo; stood by
      themselves, and marked a day in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards it was solemnly discovered that Richard wrote poetry. He read
      one of his old forgotten compositions penned when he had that ambition.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Thy truth to me is truer
        Than horse, or dog, or blade;
        Thy vows to me are fewer
        Than ever maiden made.

        Thou steppest from thy splendour
        To make my life a song:
        My bosom shall be tender
        As thine has risen strong.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      All the verses were transcribed. &ldquo;It is he who is the humble knight,&rdquo;
       Clare explained at the close, &ldquo;and his lady, is a Queen. Any Queen would
      throw her crown away for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It came to that period when Clare left Raynham with her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard was not sorry to lose me. He only loves boys and men. Something
      tells me I shall never see Raynham again. He was dressed in blue. He said
      Good-bye, Clare, and kissed me on the cheek. Richard never kisses me on
      the mouth. He did not know I went to his bed and kissed him while he was
      asleep. He sleeps with one arm under his head, and the other out on the
      bed. I moved away a bit of his hair that was over his eyes. I wanted to
      cut it. I have one piece. I do not let anybody see I am unhappy, not even
      mama. She says I want iron. I am sure I do not. I like to write my name.
      Clare Doria Forey. Richard&rsquo;s is Richard Doria Feverel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His breast rose convulsively. Clare Doria Forey! He knew the music of that
      name. He had heard it somewhere. It sounded faint and mellow now behind
      the hills of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not read for tears. It was midnight. The hour seemed to belong to
      her. The awful stillness and the darkness were Clare&rsquo;s. Clare&rsquo;s voice
      clear and cold from the grave possessed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Painfully, with blinded eyes, he looked over the breathless pages. She
      spoke of his marriage, and her finding the ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it was his. I knew he was going to be married that morning. I saw
      him stand by the altar when they laughed at breakfast. His wife must be so
      beautiful! Richard&rsquo;s wife! Perhaps he will love me better now he is
      married. Mama says they must be separated. That is shameful. If I can help
      him I will. I pray so that he may be happy. I hope God hears poor sinners&rsquo; 
      prayers. I am very sinful. Nobody knows it as I do. They say I am good,
      but I know. When I look on the ground I am not looking after earthworms,
      as he said. Oh, do forgive me, God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she spoke of her own marriage, and that it was her duty to obey her
      mother. A blank in the Diary ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen Richard. Richard despises me,&rdquo; was the next entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now as he read his eyes were fixed, and the delicate feminine
      handwriting like a black thread drew on his soul to one terrible
      conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot live. Richard despises me. I cannot bear the touch of my fingers
      or the sight of my face. Oh! I understand him now. He should not have
      kissed me so that last time. I wished to die while his mouth was on mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Further: &ldquo;I have no escape. Richard said he would die rather than endure
      it. I know he would. Why should I be afraid to do what he would do? I
      think if my husband whipped me I could bear it better. He is so kind, and
      tries to make me cheerful. He will soon be very unhappy. I pray to God
      half the night. I seem to be losing sight of my God the more I pray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard laid the book open on the table. Phantom surges seemed to be
      mounting and travelling for his brain. Had Clare taken his wild words in
      earnest? Did she lie there dead&mdash;he shrouded the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrapped the thoughts in shrouds, but he was again reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A quarter to one o&rsquo;clock. I shall not be alive this time to-morrow. I
      shall never see Richard now. I dreamed last night we were in the fields
      together, and he walked with his arm round my waist. We were children, but
      I thought we were married, and I showed him I wore his ring, and he said&mdash;if
      you always wear it, Clare, you are as good as my wife. Then I made a vow
      to wear it for ever and ever... It is not mama&rsquo;s fault. She does not think
      as Richard and I do of these things. He is not a coward, nor am I. He
      hates cowards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have written to his father to make him happy. Perhaps when I am dead he
      will hear what I say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard just now Richard call distinctly&mdash;Clare, come out to me.
      Surely he has not gone. I am going I know not where. I cannot think. I am
      very cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were written larger, and staggered towards the close, as if her
      hand had lost mastery over the pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only remember Richard now a boy. A little boy and a big boy. I am
      not sure now of his voice. I can only remember certain words. &lsquo;Clari,&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;Don Ricardo,&rsquo; and his laugh. He used to be full of fun. Once we laughed
      all day together tumbling in the hay. Then he had a friend, and began to
      write poetry, and be proud. If I had married a young man he would have
      forgiven me, but I should not have been happier. I must have died. God
      never looks on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is past two o&rsquo;clock. The sheep are bleating outside. It must be very
      cold in the ground. Good-bye, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With his name it began and ended. Even to herself Clare was not
      over-communicative. The book was slender, yet her nineteen years of
      existence left half the number of pages white.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those last words drew him irresistibly to gaze on her. There she lay, the
      same impassive Clare. For a moment he wondered she had not moved&mdash;to
      him she had become so different. She who had just filled his ears with
      strange tidings&mdash;it was not possible to think her dead! She seemed to
      have been speaking to him all through his life. His image was on that
      still heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dismissed the night-watchers from the room, and remained with her
      alone, till the sense of death oppressed him, and then the shock sent him
      to the window to look for sky and stars. Behind a low broad pine, hung
      with frosty mist, he heard a bell-wether of the flock in the silent fold.
      Death in life it sounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother found him praying at the foot of Clare&rsquo;s bed. She knelt by his
      side, and they prayed, and their joint sobs shook their bodies, but
      neither of them shed many tears. They held a dark unspoken secret in
      common. They prayed God to forgive her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clare was buried in the family vault of the Todhunters. Her mother
      breathed no wish to have her lying at Lobourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the funeral, what they alone upon earth knew brought them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the worst is over for me. I have no one to love but
      you, dear. We have all been fighting against God, and this... Richard! you
      will come with me, and be united to your wife, and spare my brother what I
      suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered the broken spirit: &ldquo;I have killed one. She sees me as I am. I
      cannot go with you to my wife, because I am not worthy to touch her hand,
      and were I to go, I should do this to silence my self-contempt. Go you to
      her, and when she asks of me, say I have a death upon my head that&mdash;No!
      say that I am abroad, seeking for that which shall cleanse me. If I find
      it I shall come to claim her. If not, God help us all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had no strength to contest his solemn words, or stay him, and he went
      forth.

      CHAPTER XLI
    </h2>
    <p>
      A man with a beard saluted the wise youth Adrian in the full blaze of
      Piccadilly with a clap on the shoulder. Adrian glanced leisurely behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to try my nerves, my dear fellow? I&rsquo;m not a man of fashion,
      happily, or you would have struck the seat of them. How are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was his welcome to Austin Wentworth after his long absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Austin took his arm, and asked for news, with the hunger of one who had
      been in the wilderness five years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Whigs have given up the ghost, my dear Austin. The free Briton is to
      receive Liberty&rsquo;s pearl, the Ballot. The Aristocracy has had a cycle&rsquo;s
      notice to quit. The Monarchy and old Madeira are going out; Demos and Cape
      wines are coming in. They call it Reform. So, you see, your absence has
      worked wonders. Depart for another five years, and you will return to
      ruined stomachs, cracked sconces, general upset, an equality made perfect
      by universal prostration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Austin indulged him in a laugh. &ldquo;I want to hear about ourselves. How is
      old Ricky?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know of his&mdash;what do they call it when greenhorns are licensed
      to jump into the milkpails of dairymaids?&mdash;a very charming little
      woman she makes, by the way&mdash;presentable! quite old Anacreon&rsquo;s rose
      in milk. Well! everybody thought the System must die of it. Not a bit. It
      continued to flourish in spite. It&rsquo;s in a consumption now, though&mdash;emaciated,
      lean, raw, spectral! I&rsquo;ve this morning escaped from Raynham to avoid the
      sight of it. I have brought our genial uncle Hippias to town&mdash;a
      delightful companion! I said to him: &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve had a fine Spring.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ugh!&rsquo; he
      answers, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s a time when you come to think the Spring old.&rsquo; You
      should have heard how he trained out the &lsquo;old.&rsquo; I felt something like
      decay in my sap just to hear him. In the prize-fight of life, my dear
      Austin, our uncle Hippias has been unfairly hit below the belt. Let&rsquo;s
      guard ourselves there, and go and order dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where&rsquo;s Ricky now, and what is he doing?&rdquo; said Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask what he has done. The miraculous boy has gone and got a baby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A child? Richard has one?&rdquo; Austin&rsquo;s clear eyes shone with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s not common among your tropical savages. He has one: one as
      big as two. That has been the death-blow to the System. It bore the
      marriage&mdash;the baby was too much for it. Could it swallow the baby,
      &lsquo;twould live. She, the wonderful woman, has produced a large boy. I assure
      you it&rsquo;s quite amusing to see the System opening its mouth every hour of
      the day, trying to gulp him down, aware that it would be a consummate
      cure, or a happy release.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By degrees Austin learnt the baronet&rsquo;s proceedings, and smiled sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How has Ricky turned out?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What sort of a character has he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor boy is ruined by his excessive anxiety about it. Character? he
      has the character of a bullet with a treble charge of powder behind it.
      Enthusiasm is the powder. That boy could get up an enthusiasm for the
      maiden days of Ops! He was going to reform the world, after your fashion,
      Austin,&mdash;you have something to answer for. Unfortunately he began
      with the feminine side of it. Cupid proud of Phoebus newly slain, or Pluto
      wishing to people his kingdom, if you like, put it into the soft head of
      one of the guileless grateful creatures to kiss him for his good work. Oh,
      horror! he never expected that. Conceive the System in the flesh, and you
      have our Richard. The consequence is, that this male Peri refuses to enter
      his Paradise, though the gates are open for him, the trumpets blow, and
      the fair unspotted one awaits him fruitful within. We heard of him last
      that he was trying the German waters&mdash;preparatory to his undertaking
      the release of Italy from the subjugation of the Teuton. Let&rsquo;s hope
      they&rsquo;ll wash him. He is in the company of Lady Judith Felle&mdash;your old
      friend, the ardent female Radical who married the decrepit to carry out
      her principles. They always marry English lords, or foreign princes: I
      admire their tactics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judith is bad for him in such a state. I like her, but she was always too
      sentimental,&rdquo; said Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sentiment made her marry the old lord, I suppose? I like her for her
      sentiment, Austin. Sentimental people are sure to live long and die fat.
      Feeling, that&rsquo;s the slayer, coz. Sentiment! &lsquo;tis the cajolery of
      existence: the soft bloom which whoso weareth, he or she is enviable.
      Would that I had more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not much changed, Adrian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a Radical, Austin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Further inquiries, responded to in Adrian&rsquo;s figurative speech, instructed
      Austin that the baronet was waiting for his son, in a posture of
      statuesque offended paternity, before he would receive his daughter-in-law
      and grandson. That was what Adrian meant by the efforts of the System to
      swallow the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a tangle,&rdquo; said the wise youth. &ldquo;Time will extricate us, I
      presume, or what is the venerable signor good for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Austin mused some minutes, and asked for Lucy&rsquo;s place of residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to her by and by,&rdquo; said Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go and see her now,&rdquo; said Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll go and order the dinner first, coz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me her address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Austin, you carry matters with too long a beard,&rdquo; Adrian
      objected. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you care what you eat?&rdquo; he roared hoarsely, looking
      humorously hurt. &ldquo;I daresay not. A slice out of him that&rsquo;s handy&mdash;sauce
      du ciel! Go, batten on the baby, cannibal. Dinner at seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Adrian gave him his own address, and Lucy&rsquo;s, and strolled off to do the
      better thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overnight Mrs. Berry had observed a long stranger in her tea-cup. Posting
      him on her fingers and starting him with a smack, he had vaulted lightly
      and thereby indicated that he was positively coming the next day. She
      forgot him in the bustle of her duties and the absorption of her faculties
      in thoughts of the incomparable stranger Lucy had presented to the world,
      till a knock at the street-door reminded her. &ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; she cried, as
      she ran to open to him. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s my stranger come!&rdquo; Never was a woman&rsquo;s
      faith in omens so justified. The stranger desired to see Mrs. Richard
      Feverel. He said his name was Mr. Austin Wentworth. Mrs. Berry clasped her
      hands, exclaiming, &ldquo;Come at last!&rdquo; and ran bolt out of the house to look
      up and down the street. Presently she returned with many excuses for her
      rudeness, saying: &ldquo;I expected to see her comin&rsquo; home, Mr. Wentworth. Every
      day twice a day she go out to give her blessed angel an airing. No leavin&rsquo; 
      the child with nursemaids for her! She is a mother! and good milk, too,
      thank the Lord! though her heart&rsquo;s so low.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indoors Mrs. Berry stated who she was, related the history of the young
      couple and her participation in it, and admired the beard. &ldquo;Although I&rsquo;d
      swear you don&rsquo;t wear it for ornament, now!&rdquo; she said, having in the first
      impulse designed a stroke at man&rsquo;s vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately Mrs. Berry spoke of the family complication, and with dejected
      head and joined hands threw out dark hints about Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Austin was giving his cheerfuller views of the case, Lucy came in
      preceding the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Austin Wentworth,&rdquo; he said, taking her hand. They read each other&rsquo;s
      faces, these two, and smiled kinship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name is Lucy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She affirmed it softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mine is Austin, as you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry allowed time for Lucy&rsquo;s charms to subdue him, and presented
      Richard&rsquo;s representative, who, seeing a new face, suffered himself to be
      contemplated before he commenced crying aloud and knocking at the doors of
      Nature for something that was due to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t he a lusty darlin&rsquo;?&rdquo; says Mrs. Berry. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t he like his own
      father? There can&rsquo;t be no doubt about zoo, zoo pitty pet. Look at his
      fists. Ain&rsquo;t he got passion? Ain&rsquo;t he a splendid roarer? Oh!&rdquo; and she went
      off rapturously into baby-language.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fine boy, certainly. Mrs. Berry exhibited his legs for further proof,
      desiring Austin&rsquo;s confirmation as to their being dumplings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy murmured a word of excuse, and bore the splendid roarer out of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She might a done it here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no prettier sight, I
      say. If her dear husband could but see that! He&rsquo;s off in his heroics&mdash;he
      want to be doin&rsquo; all sorts o&rsquo; things: I say he&rsquo;ll never do anything
      grander than that baby. You should &lsquo;a seen her uncle over that baby&mdash;he
      came here, for I said, you shall see your own family, my dear, and so she
      thinks. He come, and he laughed over that baby in the joy of his heart,
      poor man! he cried, he did. You should see that Mr. Thompson, Mr.
      Wentworth&mdash;a friend o&rsquo; Mr. Richard&rsquo;s, and a very modest-minded young
      gentleman&mdash;he worships her in his innocence. It&rsquo;s a sight to see him
      with that baby. My belief is he&rsquo;s unhappy &lsquo;cause he can&rsquo;t anyways be
      nurse-maid to him. O Mr. Wentworth! what do you think of her, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Austin&rsquo;s reply was as satisfactory as a man&rsquo;s poor speech could make it.
      He heard that Lady Feverel was in the house, and Mrs. Berry prepared the
      way for him to pay his respects to her. Then Mrs. Berry ran to Lucy, and
      the house buzzed with new life. The simple creatures felt in Austin&rsquo;s
      presence something good among them. &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t speak much,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Berry, &ldquo;but I see by his eye he mean a deal. He ain&rsquo;t one o&rsquo; yer long-word
      gentry, who&rsquo;s all gay deceivers, every one of &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy pressed the hearty suckling into her breast. &ldquo;I wonder what he thinks
      of me, Mrs. Berry? I could not speak to him. I loved him before I saw him.
      I knew what his face was like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks proper even with a beard, and that&rsquo;s a trial for a virtuous
      man,&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry. &ldquo;One sees straight through the hair with him.
      Think! he&rsquo;ll think what any man&rsquo;d think&mdash;you a-suckin spite o&rsquo; all
      your sorrow, my sweet,&mdash;and my Berry talkin&rsquo; of his Roman matrons!&mdash;here&rsquo;s
      a English wife&rsquo;ll match &lsquo;em all! that&rsquo;s what he thinks. And now that
      leetle dark under yer eye&rsquo;ll clear, my darlin&rsquo;, now he&rsquo;ve come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry looked to no more than that; Lucy to no more than the peace she
      had in being near Richard&rsquo;s best friend. When she sat down to tea it was
      with a sense that the little room that held her was her home perhaps for
      many a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chop procured and cooked by Mrs. Berry formed Austin&rsquo;s dinner. During
      the meal he entertained them with anecdotes of his travels. Poor Lucy had
      no temptation to try to conquer Austin. That heroic weakness of hers was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry had said: &ldquo;Three cups&mdash;I goes no further,&rdquo; and Lucy had
      rejected the proffer of more tea, when Austin, who was in the thick of a
      Brazilian forest, asked her if she was a good traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, can you start at a minute&rsquo;s notice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy hesitated, and then said; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; decisively, to which Mrs. Berry
      added, that she was not a &ldquo;luggage-woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There used to be a train at seven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Austin remarked, consulting
      his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women were silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you get ready to come with me to Raynham in ten minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Austin looked as if he had asked a commonplace question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy&rsquo;s lips parted to speak. She could not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loud rattled the teaboard to Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s dropping hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joy and deliverance!&rdquo; she exclaimed with a foundering voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come?&rdquo; Austin kindly asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy tried to stop her beating heart, as she answered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Mrs. Berry
      cunningly pretended to interpret the irresolution in her tones with a
      mighty whisper: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s thinking what&rsquo;s to be done with baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must learn to travel,&rdquo; said Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Berry, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll be his nuss, and bear him, a sweet! Oh!
      and think of it! me nurse-maid once more at Raynham Abbey! but it&rsquo;s
      nurse-woman now, you must say. Let us be goin&rsquo; on the spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started up and away in hot haste, fearing delay would cool the
      heaven-sent resolve. Austin smiled, eying his watch and Lucy alternately.
      She was wishing to ask a multitude of questions. His face reassured her,
      and saying: &ldquo;I will be dressed instantly,&rdquo; she also left the room.
      Talking, bustling, preparing, wrapping up my lord, and looking to their
      neatnesses, they were nevertheless ready within the time prescribed by
      Austin, and Mrs. Berry stood humming over the baby. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll sleep it
      through,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s had enough for an alderman, and goes to sleep
      sound after his dinner, he do, a duck!&rdquo; Before they departed, Lucy ran up
      to Lady Feverel. She returned for, the small one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, Mr. Wentworth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just two,&rdquo; said Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Richard was taken up, and when Lucy came back her eyes were full of
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She thinks she is never to see him again, Mr. Wentworth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shall,&rdquo; Austin said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Off they went, and with Austin near her, Lucy forgot to dwell at all upon
      the great act of courage she was performing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do hope baby will not wake,&rdquo; was her chief solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He!&rdquo; cries nurse-woman Berry, from the rear, &ldquo;his little tum-tum&rsquo;s as
      tight as he can hold, a pet! a lamb! a bird! a beauty! and ye may take yer
      oath he never wakes till that&rsquo;s slack. He&rsquo;ve got character of his own, a
      blessed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There are some tremendous citadels that only want to be taken by storm.
      The baronet sat alone in his library, sick of resistance, and rejoicing in
      the pride of no surrender; a terror to his friends and to himself. Hearing
      Austin&rsquo;s name sonorously pronounced by the man of calves, he looked up
      from his book, and held out his hand. &ldquo;Glad to see you, Austin.&rdquo; His
      appearance betokened complete security. The next minute he found himself
      escaladed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a cry from Mrs. Berry that told him others were in the room besides
      Austin. Lucy stood a little behind the lamp: Mrs. Berry close to the door.
      The door was half open, and passing through it might be seen the petrified
      figure of a fine man. The baronet glancing over the lamp rose at Mrs.
      Berry&rsquo;s signification of a woman&rsquo;s personality. Austin stepped back and
      led Lucy to him by the hand. &ldquo;I have brought Richard&rsquo;s wife, sir,&rdquo; he said
      with a pleased, perfectly uncalculating, countenance, that was disarming.
      Very pale and trembling Lucy bowed. She felt her two hands taken, and
      heard a kind voice. Could it be possible it belonged to the dreadful
      father of her husband? She lifted her eyes nervously: her hands were still
      detained. The baronet contemplated Richard&rsquo;s choice. Had he ever had a
      rivalry with those pure eyes? He saw the pain of her position shooting
      across her brows, and, uttering-gentle inquiries as to her health, placed
      her in a seat. Mrs. Berry had already fallen into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What aspect do you like for your bedroom?&mdash;East?&rdquo; said the baronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy was asking herself wonderingly: &ldquo;Am I to stay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you had better take to Richard&rsquo;s room at once,&rdquo; he pursued. &ldquo;You
      have the Lobourne valley there and a good morning air, and will feel more
      at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy&rsquo;s colour mounted. Mrs. Berry gave a short cough, as one who should
      say, &ldquo;The day is ours!&rdquo; Undoubtedly&mdash;strange as it was to think it&mdash;the
      fortress was carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy is rather tired,&rdquo; said Austin, and to hear her Christian name thus
      bravely spoken brought grateful dew to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baronet was about to touch the bell. &ldquo;But have you come alone?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this Mrs. Berry came forward. Not immediately: it seemed to require
      effort for her to move, and when she was within the region of the lamp,
      her agitation could not escape notice. The blissful bundle shook in her
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, what is he to me?&rdquo; Austin inquired generally as he went and
      unveiled the younger hope of Raynham. &ldquo;My relationship is not so defined
      as yours, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An observer might have supposed that the baronet peeped at his grandson
      with the courteous indifference of one who merely wished to compliment the
      mother of anybody&rsquo;s child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really think he&rsquo;s like Richard,&rdquo; Austin laughed. Lucy looked: I am sure
      he is!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As like as one to one,&rdquo; Mrs. Berry murmured feebly; but Grandpapa not
      speaking she thought it incumbent on her to pluck up. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s as healthy
      as his father was, Sir Austin&mdash;spite o&rsquo; the might &lsquo;a beens. Reg&rsquo;lar
      as the clock! We never want a clock since he come. We knows the hour o&rsquo; 
      the day, and of the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You nurse him yourself, of course?&rdquo; the baronet spoke to Lucy, and was
      satisfied on that point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry was going to display his prodigious legs. Lucy, fearing the
      consequent effect on the prodigious lungs, begged her not to wake him.
      &ldquo;&lsquo;T&rsquo;d take a deal to do that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry, and harped on Master
      Richard&rsquo;s health and the small wonder it was that he enjoyed it,
      considering the superior quality of his diet, and the lavish attentions of
      his mother, and then suddenly fell silent on a deep sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks healthy,&rdquo; said the baronet, &ldquo;but I am not a judge of babies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus, having capitulated, Raynham chose to acknowledge its new commandant,
      who was now borne away, under the directions of the housekeeper, to occupy
      the room Richard had slept in when an infant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Austin cast no thought on his success. The baronet said: &ldquo;She is extremely
      well-looking.&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;A person you take to at once.&rdquo; There it ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a much more animated colloquy was taking place aloft, where Lucy and
      Mrs. Berry sat alone. Lucy expected her to talk about the reception they
      had met with, and the house, and the peculiarities of the rooms, and the
      solid happiness that seemed in store. Mrs. Berry all the while would
      persist in consulting the looking-glass. Her first distinct answer was,
      &ldquo;My dear! tell me candid, how do I look?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very nice indeed, Mrs. Berry; but could you have believed he would be so
      kind, so considerate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I looked a frump,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Berry. &ldquo;Oh dear! two birds at
      a shot. What do you think, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw so wonderful a likeness,&rdquo; says Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Likeness! look at me.&rdquo; Mrs. Berry was trembling and hot in the palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very feverish, dear Berry. What can it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it like the love-flutters of a young gal, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to bed, Berry, dear,&rdquo; says Lucy, pouting in her soft caressing way. &ldquo;I
      will undress you, and see to you, dear heart! You&rsquo;ve had so much
      excitement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; Berry laughed hysterically; &ldquo;she thinks it&rsquo;s about this business
      of hers. Why, it&rsquo;s child&rsquo;s-play, my darlin&rsquo;. But I didn&rsquo;t look for tragedy
      to-night. Sleep in this house I can&rsquo;t, my love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy was astonished. &ldquo;Not sleep here, Mrs. Berry?&mdash;Oh! why, you silly
      old thing? I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do ye!&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry, with a sceptical nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re afraid of ghosts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belike I am when they&rsquo;re six foot two in their shoes, and bellows when
      you stick a pin into their calves. I seen my Berry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Large as life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy meditated on optical delusions, but Mrs. Berry described him as the
      Colossus who had marched them into the library, and vowed that he had
      recognized her and quaked. &ldquo;Time ain&rsquo;t aged him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry,
      &ldquo;whereas me! he&rsquo;ve got his excuse now. I know I look a frump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy kissed her: &ldquo;You look the nicest, dearest old thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may say an old thing, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your husband is really here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Berry&rsquo;s below!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Profoundly uttered as this was, it chased every vestige of incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you do, Mrs. Berry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, my dear. Leave him to be happy in his own way. It&rsquo;s over atween us, I
      see that. When I entered the house I felt there was something comin&rsquo; over
      me, and lo and behold ye! no sooner was we in the hall-passage&mdash;if it
      hadn&rsquo;t been for that blessed infant I should &lsquo;a dropped. I must &lsquo;a known
      his step, for my heart began thumpin&rsquo;, and I knew I hadn&rsquo;t got my hair
      straight&mdash;that Mr. Wentworth was in such a hurry&mdash;nor my best
      gown. I knew he&rsquo;d scorn me. He hates frumps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scorn you!&rdquo; cried Lucy, angrily. &ldquo;He who has behaved so wickedly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry attempted to rise. &ldquo;I may as well go at once,&rdquo; she whimpered.
      &ldquo;If I see him I shall only be disgracin&rsquo; of myself. I feel it all on my
      side already. Did ye mark him, my dear? I know I was vexin&rsquo; to him at
      times, I was. Those big men are so touchy about their dignity&mdash;nat&rsquo;ral.
      Hark at me! I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; all soft in a minute. Let me leave the house, my
      dear. I daresay it was good half my fault. Young women don&rsquo;t understand
      men sufficient&mdash;not altogether&mdash;and I was a young woman then;
      and then what they goes and does they ain&rsquo;t quite answerable for: they,
      feels, I daresay, pushed from behind. Yes. I&rsquo;ll go. I&rsquo;m a frump. I&rsquo;ll go.
      &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t in natur&rsquo; for me to sleep in the same house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy laid her hands on Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s shoulders, and forcibly fixed her in
      her seat. &ldquo;Leave baby, naughty woman? I tell you he shall come to you, and
      fall on his knees to you and beg your forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Berry on his knees!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And he shall beg and pray you to forgive him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you get more from Martin Berry than breath-away words, great&rsquo;ll be my
      wonder!&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will see,&rdquo; said Lucy, thoroughly determined to do something for the
      good creature that had befriended her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry examined her gown. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it seem we&rsquo;re runnin&rsquo; after him?&rdquo; she
      murmured faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is your husband, Mrs. Berry. He may be wanting to come to you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Where is all I was goin&rsquo; to say to that man when we met.&rdquo; Mrs. Berry
      ejaculated. Lucy had left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the landing outside the door Lucy met a lady dressed in black, who
      stopped her and asked if she was Richard&rsquo;s wife, and kissed her, passing
      from her immediately. Lucy despatched a message for Austin, and related
      the Berry history. Austin sent for the great man and said: &ldquo;Do you know
      your wife is here?&rdquo; Before Berry had time to draw himself up to enunciate
      his longest, he was requested to step upstairs, and as his young mistress
      at once led the way, Berry could not refuse to put his legs in motion and
      carry the stately edifice aloft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the interview Mrs. Berry gave Lucy a slight sketch that night. &ldquo;He
      began in the old way, my dear, and says I, a true heart and plain words,
      Martin Berry. So there he cuts himself and his Johnson short, and down he
      goes&mdash;down on his knees. I never could &lsquo;a believed it. I kep my
      dignity as a woman till I see that sight, but that done for me. I was a
      ripe apple in his arms &lsquo;fore I knew where I was. There&rsquo;s something about a
      fine man on his knees that&rsquo;s too much for us women. And it reely was the
      penitent on his two knees, not the lover on his one. If he mean it! But
      ah! what do you think he begs of me, my dear?&mdash;not to make it known
      in the house just yet! I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t say that look well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucy attributed it to his sense of shame at his conduct, and Mrs. Berry
      did her best to look on it in that light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the bar&rsquo;net kiss ye when you wished him goodnight?&rdquo; she asked. Lucy
      said he had not. &ldquo;Then bide awake as long as ye can,&rdquo; was Mrs. Berry&rsquo;s
      rejoinder. &ldquo;And now let us pray blessings on that simple-speaking
      gentleman who does so much &lsquo;cause he says so little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like many other natural people, Mrs. Berry was only silly where her own
      soft heart was concerned. As she secretly anticipated, the baronet came
      into her room when all was quiet. She saw him go and bend over Richard the
      Second, and remain earnestly watching him. He then went to the half-opened
      door of the room where Lucy slept, leaned his ear a moment, knocked
      gently, and entered. Mrs. Berry heard low words interchanging within. She
      could not catch a syllable, yet she would have sworn to the context.
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ve called her his daughter, promised her happiness, and given a
      father&rsquo;s kiss to her.&rdquo; When Sir Austin passed out she was in a deep sleep.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Briareus reddening angrily over the sea&mdash;what is that vaporous Titan?
      And Hesper set in his rosy garland&mdash;why looks he so implacably sweet?
      It is that one has left that bright home to go forth and do cloudy work,
      and he has got a stain with which he dare not return. Far in the West fair
      Lucy beckons him to come. Ah, heaven! if he might! How strong and fierce
      the temptation is! how subtle the sleepless desire! it drugs his reason,
      his honour. For he loves her; she is still the first and only woman to
      him. Otherwise would this black spot be hell to him? otherwise would his
      limbs be chained while her arms are spread open to him. And if he loves
      her, why then what is one fall in the pit, or a thousand? Is not love the
      password to that beckoning bliss? So may we say; but here is one whose
      body has been made a temple to him, and it is desecrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      A temple, and desecrated! For what is it fit for but for a dance of
      devils? His education has thus wrought him to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      He can blame nothing but his own baseness. But to feel base and accept the
      bliss that beckons&mdash;he has not fallen so low as that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, happy English home! sweet wife! what mad miserable Wisp of the Fancy
      led him away from you, high in his conceit? Poor wretch! that thought to
      be he of the hundred hands, and war against the absolute Gods. Jove
      whispered a light commission to the Laughing Dame; she met him; and how
      did he shake Olympus? with laughter?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sure it were better to be Orestes, the Furies howling in his ears, than
      one called to by a heavenly soul from whom he is for ever outcast. He has
      not the oblivion of madness. Clothed in the lights of his first passion,
      robed in the splendour of old skies, she meets him everywhere; morning,
      evening, night, she shines above him; waylays him suddenly in forest
      depths; drops palpably on his heart. At moments he forgets; he rushes to
      embrace her; calls her his beloved, and lo, her innocent kiss brings agony
      of shame to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daily the struggle endured. His father wrote to him, begging him by the
      love he had for him to return. From that hour Richard burnt unread all the
      letters he received. He knew too well how easily he could persuade
      himself: words from without might tempt him and quite extinguish the spark
      of honourable feeling that tortured him, and that he clung to in desperate
      self-vindication.
    </p>
    <p>
      To arrest young gentlemen on the downward slope is both a dangerous and
      thankless office. It is, nevertheless, one that fair women greatly prize,
      and certain of them professionally follow. Lady Judith, as far as her sex
      would permit, was also of the Titans in their battle against the absolute
      Gods; for which purpose, mark you, she had married a lord incapable in all
      save his acres. Her achievements she kept to her own mind: she did not
      look happy over them. She met Richard accidentally in Paris; she saw his
      state; she let him learn that she alone on earth understood him. The
      consequence was that he was forthwith enrolled in her train. It soothed
      him to be near a woman. Did she venture her guess as to the cause of his
      conduct, she blotted it out with a facility women have, and cast on it a
      melancholy hue he was taught to participate in. She spoke of sorrows,
      personal sorrows, much as he might speak of his&mdash;vaguely, and with
      self-blame. And she understood him. How the dark unfathomed wealth within
      us gleams to a woman&rsquo;s eye! We are at compound interest immediately: so
      much richer than we knew!&mdash;almost as rich as we dreamed! But then the
      instant we are away from her we find ourselves bankrupt, beggared. How is
      that? We do not ask. We hurry to her and bask hungrily in her orbs. The
      eye must be feminine to be thus creative: I cannot say why. Lady Judith
      understood Richard, and he feeling infinitely vile, somehow held to her
      more feverishly, as one who dreaded the worst in missing her. The spirit
      must rest; he was weak with what he suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Austin found them among the hills of Nassau in Rhineland: Titans, male and
      female, who had not displaced Jove, and were now adrift, prone on floods
      of sentiment. The blue-flocked peasant swinging behind his oxen of a
      morning, the gaily-kerchiefed fruit-woman, the jackass-driver, even the
      doctor of those regions, have done more for their fellows. Horrible
      reflection! Lady Judith is serene above it, but it frets at Richard when
      he is out of her shadow. Often wretchedly he watches the young men of his
      own age trooping to their work. Not cloud-work theirs! Work solid,
      unambitious, fruitful!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Judith had a nobler in prospect for the hero. He gaped blindfolded
      for anything, and she gave him the map of Europe in tatters. He swallowed
      it comfortably. It was an intoxicating cordial. Himself on horseback
      overriding wrecks of Empires! Well might common sense cower with the
      meaner animals at the picture. Tacitly they agreed to recast the civilized
      globe. The quality of vapour is to melt and shape itself anew; but it is
      never the quality of vapour to reassume the same shapes. Briareus of the
      hundred unoccupied hands may turn to a monstrous donkey with his hind legs
      aloft, or twenty thousand jabbering apes. The phantasmic groupings of the
      young brain are very like those we see in the skies, and equally the sport
      of the wind. Lady Judith blew. There was plenty of vapour in him, and it
      always resolved into some shape or other. You that mark those clouds of
      eventide, and know youth, will see the similitude: it will not be strange,
      it will barely seem foolish to you, that a young man of Richard&rsquo;s age,
      Richard&rsquo;s education and position, should be in this wild state. Had he not
      been nursed to believe he was born for great things? Did she not say she
      was sure of it? And to feel base, yet born for better, is enough to make
      one grasp at anything cloudy. Suppose the hero with a game leg. How
      intense is his faith to quacks! with what a passion of longing is he not
      seized to break somebody&rsquo;s head! They spoke of Italy in low voices. &ldquo;The
      time will come,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;And I shall be ready,&rdquo; said he. What rank was
      he to take in the liberating army? Captain, colonel, general in chief, or
      simple private? Here, as became him, he was much more positive and
      specific than she was: Simple private, he said. Yet he save himself
      caracoling on horseback. Private in the cavalry, then, of course. Private
      in the cavalry over-riding wrecks of Empires. She looked forth under her
      brows with mournful indistinctness at that object in the distance. They
      read Petrarch to get up the necessary fires. Italia mia! Vain indeed was
      this speaking to those thick and mortal wounds in her fair body, but their
      sighs went with the Tiber, the Arno, and the Po, and their hands joined.
      Who has not wept for Italy? I see the aspirations of a world arise for
      her, thick and frequent as the puffs of smoke from cigars of Pannonian
      sentries!
    </p>
    <p>
      So when Austin came Richard said he could not leave Lady Judith, Lady
      Judith said she could not part with him. For his sake, mind! This Richard
      verified. Perhaps he had reason to be grateful. The high road of Folly may
      have led him from one that terminates worse. He is foolish, God knows; but
      for my part I will not laugh at the hero because he has not got his
      occasion. Meet him when he is, as it were, anointed by his occasion, and
      he is no laughing matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard felt his safety in this which, to please the world, we must term
      folly. Exhalation of vapours was a wholesome process to him, and somebody
      who gave them shape and hue a beneficent Iris. He told Austin plainly he
      could not leave her, and did not anticipate the day when he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you go to your wife, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a reason you would be the first to approve, Austin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He welcomed Austin with every show of manly tenderness, and sadness at
      heart. Austin he had always associated with his Lucy in that Hesperian
      palace of the West. Austin waited patiently. Lady Judith&rsquo;s old lord played
      on all the baths in Nassau without evoking the tune of health.
      Whithersoever he listed she changed her abode. So admirable a wife was to
      be pardoned for espousing an old man. She was an enthusiast even in her
      connubial duties. She had the brows of an enthusiast. With occasion she
      might have been a Charlotte Corday. So let her also be shielded from the
      ban of ridicule. Nonsense of enthusiasts is very different from nonsense
      of ninnies. She was truly a high-minded person, of that order who always
      do what they see to be right, and always have confidence in their optics.
      She was not unworthy of a young man&rsquo;s admiration, if she was unfit to be
      his guide. She resumed her ancient intimacy with Austin easily, while she
      preserved her new footing with Richard. She and Austin were not unlike,
      only Austin never dreamed, and had not married an old lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three were walking on the bridge at Limburg on the Lahn, where the
      shadow of a stone bishop is thrown by the moonlight on the water brawling
      over slabs of slate. A woman passed them bearing in her arms a baby, whose
      mighty size drew their attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a wopper!&rdquo; Richard laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is a fine fellow,&rdquo; said Austin, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s much
      bigger than your boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do for a nineteenth-century Arminius,&rdquo; Richard was saying. Then he
      looked at Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that you said?&rdquo; Lady Judith asked of Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I said that deserves to be repeated?&rdquo; Austin counterqueried
      quite innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard has a son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His modesty goes very far,&rdquo; said Lady Judith, sweeping the shadow of a
      curtsey to Richard&rsquo;s paternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard&rsquo;s heart throbbed with violence. He looked again in Austin&rsquo;s face.
      Austin took it so much as a matter of course that he said nothing more on
      the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; murmured Lady Judith.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the two men were alone, Richard said in a quick voice: &ldquo;Austin! you
      were in earnest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know it, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, they all wrote to you. Lucy wrote to you: your father, your aunt. I
      believe Adrian wrote too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tore up their letters,&rdquo; said Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a noble fellow, I can tell you. You&rsquo;ve nothing to be ashamed of.
      He&rsquo;ll soon be coming to ask about you. I made sure you knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I never knew.&rdquo; Richard walked away, and then said: &ldquo;What is he like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he really is like you, but he has his mother&rsquo;s eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I think the child has kept her well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re both at Raynham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hence fantastic vapours! What are ye to this! Where are the dreams of the
      hero when he learns he has a child? Nature is taking him to her bosom. She
      will speak presently. Every domesticated boor in these hills can boast the
      same, yet marvels the hero at none of his visioned prodigies as he does
      when he comes to hear of this most common performance. A father? Richard
      fixed his eyes as if he were trying to make out the lineaments of his
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Telling Austin he would be back in a few minutes, he sallied into the air,
      and walked on and on. &ldquo;A father!&rdquo; he kept repeating to himself: &ldquo;a child!&rdquo;
       And though he knew it not, he was striking the keynotes of Nature. But he
      did know of a singular harmony that suddenly burst over his whole being.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon was surpassingly bright: the summer air heavy and still. He left
      the high road and pierced into the forest. His walk was rapid: the leaves
      on the trees brushed his cheeks; the dead leaves heaped in the dells
      noised to his feet. Something of a religious joy&mdash;a strange sacred
      pleasure&mdash;was in him. By degrees it wore; he remembered himself: and
      now he was possessed by a proportionate anguish. A father! he dared never
      see his child. And he had no longer his phantasies to fall upon. He was
      utterly bare to his sin. In his troubled mind it seemed to him that Clare
      looked down on him&mdash;Clare who saw him as he was; and that to her eyes
      it would be infamy for him to go and print his kiss upon his child. Then
      came stern efforts to command his misery and make the nerves of his face
      iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the log of an ancient tree half buried in dead leaves of past summers,
      beside a brook, he halted as one who had reached his journey&rsquo;s end. There
      he discovered he had a companion in Lady Judith&rsquo;s little dog. He gave the
      friendly animal a pat of recognition, and both were silent in the
      forest-silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible for Richard to return; his heart was surcharged. He must
      advance, and on he footed, the little dog following.
    </p>
    <p>
      An oppressive slumber hung about the forest-branches. In the dells and on
      the heights was the same dead heat. Here where the brook tinkled it was no
      cool-lipped sound, but metallic, and without the spirit of water. Yonder
      in a space of moonlight on lush grass, the beams were as white fire to
      sight and feeling. No haze spread around. The valleys were clear, defined
      to the shadows of their verges, the distances sharply distinct, and with
      the colours of day but slightly softened. Richard beheld a roe moving
      across a slope of sward far out of rifle-mark. The breathless silence was
      significant, yet the moon shone in a broad blue heaven. Tongue out of
      mouth trotted the little dog after him; crouched panting when he stopped
      an instant; rose weariedly when he started afresh. Now and then a large
      white night-moth flitted through the dusk of the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a barren corner of the wooded highland looking inland stood grey
      topless ruins set in nettles and rank grass-blades. Richard mechanically
      sat down on the crumbling flints to rest, and listened to the panting of
      the dog. Sprinkled at his feet were emerald lights: hundreds of glow-worms
      studded the dark dry ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat and eyed them, thinking not at all. His energies were expended in
      action. He sat as a part of the ruins, and the moon turned his shadow
      Westward from the South. Overhead, as she declined, long ripples of silver
      cloud were imperceptibly stealing toward her. They were the van of a
      tempest. He did not observe them or the leaves beginning to chatter. When
      he again pursued his course with his face to the Rhine, a huge mountain
      appeared to rise sheer over him, and he had it in his mind to scale it. He
      got no nearer to the base of it for all his vigorous outstepping. The
      ground began to dip; he lost sight of the sky. Then heavy, thunder-drops
      streak his cheek, the leaves were singing, the earth breathed, it was
      black before him, and behind. All at once the thunder spoke. The mountain
      he had marked was bursting over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up startled the whole forest in violet fire. He saw the country at the
      foot of the hills to the bounding Rhine gleam, quiver, extinguished. Then
      there were pauses; and the lightning seemed as the eye of heaven, and the
      thunder as the tongue of heaven, each alternately addressing him; filling
      him with awful rapture. Alone there&mdash;sole human creature among the
      grandeurs and mysteries of storm&mdash;he felt the representative of his
      kind, and his spirit rose, and marched, and exulted, let it be glory, let
      it be ruin! Lower down the lightened abysses of air rolled the wrathful
      crash; then white thrusts of light were darted from the sky, and great
      curving ferns, seen steadfast in pallor a second, were supernaturally
      agitated, and vanished. Then a shrill song roused in the leaves and the
      herbage. Prolonged and louder it sounded, as deeper and heavier the deluge
      pressed. A mighty force of water satisfied the desire of the earth. Even
      in this, drenched as he was by the first outpouring, Richard had a savage
      pleasure. Keeping in motion, he was scarcely conscious of the wet, and the
      grateful breath of the weeds was refreshing. Suddenly he stopped short,
      lifting a curious nostril. He fancied he smelt meadow-sweet. He had never
      seen the flower in Rhineland&mdash;never thought of it; and it would
      hardly be met with in a forest. He was sure he smelt it fresh in dews. His
      little companion wagged a miserable wet tail some way in advance. He went
      an slowly, thinking indistinctly. After two or three steps he stooped and
      stretched out his hand to feel for the flower, having, he knew not why, a
      strong wish to verify its growth there. Groping about, his hand
      encountered something warm that started at his touch, and he, with the
      instinct we have, seized it, and lifted it to look at it. The creature was
      very small, evidently quite young. Richard&rsquo;s eyes, now accustomed to the
      darkness, were able to discern it for what it was, a tiny leveret, and ha
      supposed that the dog had probably frightened its dam just before he found
      it. He put the little thing on one hand in his breast, and stepped out
      rapidly as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain was now steady; from every tree a fountain poured. So cool and
      easy had his mind become that he was speculating on what kind of shelter
      the birds could find, and how the butterflies and moths saved their
      coloured wings from washing. Folded close they might hang under a leaf, he
      thought. Lovingly he looked into the dripping darkness of the coverts on
      each side, as one of their children. He was next musing on a strange
      sensation he experienced. It ran up one arm with an indescribable thrill,
      but communicated nothing to his heart. It was purely physical, ceased for
      a time, and recommenced, till he had it all through his blood, wonderfully
      thrilling. He grew aware that the little thing he carried in his breast
      was licking his hand there. The small rough tongue going over and over the
      palm of his hand produced the strange sensation he felt. Now that he knew
      the cause, the marvel ended; but now that he knew the cause, his heart was
      touched and made more of it. The gentle scraping continued without
      intermission as on he walked. What did it say to him? Human tongue could
      not have said so much just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pale grey light on the skirts of the flying tempest displayed the dawn.
      Richard was walking hurriedly. The green drenched weeds lay all about in
      his path, bent thick, and the forest drooped glimmeringly. Impelled as a
      man who feels a revelation mounting obscurely to his brain, Richard was
      passing one of those little forest-chapels, hung with votive wreaths,
      where the peasant halts to kneel and pray. Cold, still, in the twilight it
      stood, rain-drops pattering round it. He looked within, and saw the Virgin
      holding her Child. He moved by. But not many steps had he gone ere his
      strength went out of him, and he shuddered. What was it? He asked not. He
      was in other hands. Vivid as lightning the Spirit of Life illumined him.
      He felt in his heart the cry of his child, his darling&rsquo;s touch. With shut
      eyes he saw them both. They drew him from the depths; they led him a blind
      and tottering man. And as they led him he had a sense of purification so
      sweet he shuddered again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he looked out from his trance on the breathing world, the small birds
      hopped and chirped: warm fresh sunlight was over all the hills. He was on
      the edge of the forest, entering a plain clothed with ripe corn under a
      spacious morning sky.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      They heard at Raynham that Richard was coming. Lucy had the news first in
      a letter from Ripton Thompson, who met him at Bonn. Ripton did not say
      that he had employed his vacation holiday on purpose to use his efforts to
      induce his dear friend to return to his wife; and finding Richard already
      on his way, of course Ripton said nothing to him, but affected to be
      travelling for his pleasure like any cockney. Richard also wrote to her.
      In case she should have gone to the sea he directed her to send word to
      his hotel that he might not lose an hour. His letter was sedate in tone,
      very sweet to her. Assisted by the faithful female Berry, she was
      conquering an Aphorist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woman&rsquo;s reason is in the milk of her breasts,&rdquo; was one of his rough
      notes, due to an observation of Lucy&rsquo;s maternal cares. Let us remember,
      therefore, we men who have drunk of it largely there, that she has it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry zealously apprised him how early Master Richard&rsquo;s education had
      commenced, and the great future historian he must consequently be. This
      trait in Lucy was of itself sufficient to win Sir Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here my plan with Richard was false,&rdquo; he reflected: &ldquo;in presuming that
      anything save blind fortuity would bring him such a mate as he should
      have.&rdquo; He came to add: &ldquo;And has got!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could admit now that instinct had so far beaten science; for as Richard
      was coming, as all were to be happy, his wisdom embraced them all
      paternally as the author of their happiness. Between him and Lucy a tender
      intimacy grew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you she could talk, sir,&rdquo; said Adrian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She thinks!&rdquo; said the baronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The delicate question how she was to treat her uncle, he settled
      generously. Farmer Blaize should come up to Raynham when he would: Lucy
      must visit him at least three times a week. He had Farmer Blaize and Mrs.
      Berry to study, and really excellent Aphorisms sprang from the plain human
      bases this natural couple presented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will do us no harm,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;some of the honest blood of the soil
      in our veins.&rdquo; And he was content in musing on the parentage of the little
      cradled boy. A common sight for those who had the entry to the library was
      the baronet cherishing the hand of his daughter-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Richard was crossing the sea, and hearts at Raynham were beating
      quicker measures as the minutes progressed. That night he would be with
      them. Sir Austin gave Lucy a longer, warmer salute when she came down to
      breakfast in the morning. Mrs. Berry waxed thrice amorous. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your
      second bridals, ye sweet livin&rsquo; widow!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Thanks be the Lord!
      it&rsquo;s the same man too! and a baby over the bed-post,&rdquo; she appended
      seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; Berry declared it to be, &ldquo;strange I feel none o&rsquo; this to my
      Berry now. All my feelin&rsquo;s o&rsquo; love seem t&rsquo;ave gone into you two sweet
      chicks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the faithless male Berry complained of being treated badly, and
      affected a superb jealousy of the baby; but the good dame told him that if
      he suffered at all he suffered his due. Berry&rsquo;s position was decidedly
      uncomfortable. It could not be concealed from the lower household that he
      had a wife in the establishment, and for the complications this gave rise
      to, his wife would not legitimately console him. Lucy did intercede, but
      Mrs. Berry, was obdurate. She averred she would not give up the child till
      he was weaned. &ldquo;Then, perhaps,&rdquo; she said prospectively. &ldquo;You see I ain&rsquo;t
      so soft as you thought for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a very unkind, vindictive old woman,&rdquo; said Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belike I am,&rdquo; Mrs. Berry was proud to agree. We like a new character, now
      and then. Berry had delayed too long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were it not notorious that the straightlaced prudish dare not listen to,
      the natural chaste, certain things Mrs. Berry thought it advisable to
      impart to the young wife with regard to Berry&rsquo;s infidelity, and the
      charity women should have toward sinful men, might here be reproduced.
      Enough that she thought proper to broach the matter, and cite her own
      Christian sentiments, now that she was indifferent in some degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oily calm is on the sea. At Raynham they look up at the sky and speculate
      that Richard is approaching fairly speeded. He comes to throw himself on
      his darling&rsquo;s mercy. Lucy irradiated over forest and sea, tempest and
      peace&mdash;to her the hero comes humbly. Great is that day when we see
      our folly! Ripton and he were the friends of old. Richard encouraged him
      to talk of the two he could be eloquent on, and Ripton, whose secret
      vanity was in his powers of speech, never tired of enumerating Lucy&rsquo;s
      virtues, and the peculiar attributes of the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did not say a word against me, Rip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against you, Richard! The moment she knew she was to be a mother, she
      thought of nothing but her duty to the child. She&rsquo;s one who can&rsquo;t think of
      herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen her at Raynham, Rip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, once. They asked me down. And your father&rsquo;s so fond of her&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      sure he thinks no woman like her, and he&rsquo;s right. She is so lovely, and so
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard was too full of blame of himself to blame his father: too British
      to expose his emotions. Ripton divined how deep and changed they were by
      his manner. He had cast aside the hero, and however Ripton had obeyed him
      and looked up to him in the heroic time, he loved him tenfold now. He told
      his friend how much Lucy&rsquo;s mere womanly sweetness and excellence had done
      for him, and Richard contrasted his own profitless extravagance with the
      patient beauty of his dear home angel. He was not one to take her on the
      easy terms that offered. There was that to do which made his cheek burn as
      he thought of it, but he was going to do it, even though it lost her to
      him. Just to see her and kneel to her was joy sufficient to sustain him,
      and warm his blood in the prospect. They marked the white cliffs growing
      over the water. Nearer, the sun made them lustrous. Houses and people
      seemed to welcome the wild youth to common sense, simplicity, and home.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were in town by mid-day. Richard had a momentary idea of not driving
      to his hotel for letters. After a short debate he determined to go there.
      The porter said he had two letters for Mr. Richard Feverel&mdash;one had
      been waiting some time. He went to the box and fetched them. The first
      Richard opened was from Lucy, and as he read it, Ripton observed the
      colour deepen on his face, while a quivering smile played about his mouth.
      He opened the other indifferently. It began without any form of address.
      Richard&rsquo;s forehead darkened at the signature. This letter was in a sloping
      feminine hand, and flourished with light strokes all over, like a field of
      the bearded barley. Thus it ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you are in a rage with me because I would not consent to ruin you,
      you foolish fellow. What do you call it? Going to that unpleasant place
      together. Thank you, my milliner is not ready yet, and I want to make a
      good appearance when I do go. I suppose I shall have to some day. Your
      health, Sir Richard. Now let me speak to you seriously. Go home to your
      wife at once. But I know the sort of fellow you are, and I must be plain
      with you. Did I ever say I loved you? You may hate me as much as you
      please, but I will save you from being a fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now listen to me. You know my relations with Mount. That beast Brayder
      offered to pay all my debts and set me afloat, if I would keep you in
      town. I declare on my honour I had no idea why, and I did not agree to it.
      But you were such a handsome fellow&mdash;I noticed you in the park before
      I heard a word of you. But then you fought shy&mdash;you were just as
      tempting as a girl. You stung me. Do you know what that is? I would make
      you care for me, and we know how it ended, without any intention of mine,
      I swear. I&rsquo;d have cut off my hand rather than do you any harm, upon my
      honour. Circumstances! Then I saw it was all up between us. Brayder came
      and began to chaff about you. I dealt the animal a stroke on the face with
      my riding-whip&mdash;I shut him up pretty quick. Do you think I would let
      a man speak about you?&mdash;I was going to swear. You see I remember
      Dick&rsquo;s lessons. O my God! I do feel unhappy.&mdash;Brayder offered me
      money. Go and think I took it, if you like. What do I care what anybody
      thinks! Something that black-guard said made me suspicious. I went down to
      the Isle of Wight where Mount was, and your wife was just gone with an old
      lady who came and took her away. I should so have liked to see her. You
      said, you remember, she would take me as a sister, and treat me&mdash;I
      laughed at it then. My God! how I could cry now, if water did any good to
      a devil, as you politely call poor me. I called at your house and saw your
      man-servant, who said Mount had just been there. In a minute it struck me.
      I was sure Mount was after a woman, but it never struck me that woman was
      your wife. Then I saw why they wanted me to keep you away. I went to
      Brayder. You know how I hate him. I made love to the man to get it out of
      him. Richard! my word of honour, they have planned to carry her off, if
      Mount finds he cannot seduce her. Talk of devils! He&rsquo;s one; but he is not
      so bad as Brayder. I cannot forgive a mean dog his villany.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now after this, I am quite sure you are too much of a man to stop away
      from her another moment. I have no more to say. I suppose we shall not see
      each other again, so good-bye, Dick! I fancy I hear you cursing me. Why
      can&rsquo;t you feel like other men on the subject? But if you were like the
      rest of them I should not have cared for you a farthing. I have not worn
      lilac since I saw you last. I&rsquo;ll be buried in your colour, Dick. That will
      not offend you&mdash;will it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going to believe I took the money? If I thought you thought
      that&mdash;it makes me feel like a devil only to fancy you think it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first time you meet Brayder, cane him publicly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu! Say it&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t like his face. I suppose devils must
      not say Adieu. Here&rsquo;s plain old good-bye, then, between you and me.
      Good-bye, dear Dick! You won&rsquo;t think that of me?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I eat dry bread to the day of my death if I took or ever will touch a
      scrap of their money. BELLA.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard folded up the letter silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jump into the cab,&rdquo; he said to Ripton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything the matter, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The driver received directions. Richard sat without speaking. His friend
      knew that face. He asked whether there was bad news in the letter. For
      answer, he had the lie circumstancial. He ventured to remark that they
      were going the wrong way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;d the right way,&rdquo; cried Richard, and his jaws were hard and square,
      and his eyes looked heavy and full.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton said no more, but thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cabman pulled up at a Club. A gentleman, in whom Ripton recognized the
      Hon. Peter Brayder, was just then swinging a leg over his horse, with one
      foot in the stirrup. Hearing his name called, the Hon. Peter turned about,
      and stretched an affable hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mountfalcon in town?&rdquo; said Richard taking the horse&rsquo;s reins instead of
      the gentlemanly hand. His voice and aspect were quite friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mount?&rdquo; Brayder replied, curiously watching the action; &ldquo;yes. He&rsquo;s off
      this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in town?&rdquo; Richard released his horse. &ldquo;I want to see him. Where is
      he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked pleasant: that which might have aroused Brayder&rsquo;s
      suspicions was an old affair in parasitical register by this time. &ldquo;Want
      to see him? What about?&rdquo; he said carelessly, and gave the address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he sang out, &ldquo;we thought of putting your name down,
      Feverel.&rdquo; He indicated the lofty structure. &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard nodded back at him, crying, &ldquo;Hurry.&rdquo; Brayder returned the nod, and
      those who promenaded the district soon beheld his body in elegant motion
      to the stepping of his well-earned horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to see Lord Mountfalcon for, Richard?&rdquo; said Ripton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just want to see him,&rdquo; Richard replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton was left in the cab at the door of my lord&rsquo;s residence. He had to
      wait there a space of about ten minutes, when Richard returned with a
      clearer visage, though somewhat heated. He stood outside the cab, and
      Ripton was conscious of being examined by those strong grey eyes. As clear
      as speech he understood them to say to him, &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; but which of
      the many things on earth he would not do for he was at a loss to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go down to Raynham, Ripton. Say I shall be there tonight certainly. Don&rsquo;t
      bother me with questions. Drive off at once. Or wait. Get another cab.
      I&rsquo;ll take this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton was ejected, and found himself standing alone in the street. As he
      was on the point of rushing after the galloping cab-horse to get a word of
      elucidation, he heard some one speak behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Feverel&rsquo;s friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton had an eye for lords. An ambrosial footman, standing at the open
      door of Lord Mountfalcon&rsquo;s house, and a gentleman standing on the
      doorstep, told him that he was addressed by that nobleman. He was
      requested to step into the house. When they were alone, Lord Mountfalcon,
      slightly ruffled, said: &ldquo;Feverel has insulted me grossly. I must meet him,
      of course. It&rsquo;s a piece of infernal folly!&mdash;I suppose he is not quite
      mad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton&rsquo;s only definite answer was, a gasping iteration of &ldquo;My lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My lord resumed: &ldquo;I am perfectly guiltless of offending him, as far as I
      know. In fact, I had a friendship for him. Is he liable to fits of this
      sort of thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not yet at conversation-point, Ripton stammered: &ldquo;Fits, my lord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; went the other, eying Ripton in lordly cognizant style. &ldquo;You know
      nothing of this business, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ripton said he did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any influence with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much, my lord. Only now and then&mdash;a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not in the Army?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question was quite unnecessary. Ripton confessed to the law, and my
      lord did not look surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not detain you,&rdquo; he said, distantly bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton gave him a commoner&rsquo;s obeisance; but getting to the door, the sense
      of the matter enlightened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a duel, my lord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No help for it, if his friends don&rsquo;t shut him up in Bedlam between this
      and to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of all horrible things a duel was the worst in Ripton&rsquo;s imagination. He
      stood holding the handle of the door, revolving this last chapter of
      calamity suddenly opened where happiness had promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A duel! but he won&rsquo;t, my lord,&mdash;he mustn&rsquo;t fight, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must come on the ground,&rdquo; said my lord, positively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton ejaculated unintelligible stuff. Finally Lord Mountfalcon said: &ldquo;I
      went out of my way, sir, in speaking to you. I saw you from the window.
      Your friend is mad. Deuced methodical, I admit, but mad. I have particular
      reasons to wish not to injure the young man, and if an apology is to be
      got out of him when we&rsquo;re on the ground, I&rsquo;ll take it, and we&rsquo;ll stop the
      damned scandal, if possible. You understand? I&rsquo;m the insulted party, and I
      shall only require of him to use formal words of excuse to come to an
      amicable settlement. Let him just say he regrets it. Now, sir,&rdquo; the
      nobleman spoke with considerable earnestness, &ldquo;should anything happen&mdash;I
      have the honour to be known to Mrs. Feverel&mdash;and I beg you will tell
      her. I very particularly desire you to let her know that I was not to
      blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mountfalcon rang the bell, and bowed him out. With this on his mind Ripton
      hurried down to those who were waiting in joyful trust at Raynham.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The watch consulted by Hippias alternately with his pulse, in occult
      calculation hideous to mark, said half-past eleven on the midnight.
      Adrian, wearing a composedly amused expression on his dimpled plump face,&mdash;held
      slightly sideways, aloof from paper and pen,&mdash;sat writing at the
      library table. Round the baronet&rsquo;s chair, in a semi-circle, were Lucy,
      Lady Blandish, Mrs. Doria, and Ripton, that very ill bird at Raynham. They
      were silent as those who question the flying minutes. Ripton had said that
      Richard was sure to come; but the feminine eyes reading him ever and anon,
      had gathered matter for disquietude, which increased as time sped. Sir
      Austin persisted in his habitual air of speculative repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remote as he appeared from vulgar anxiety, he was the first to speak and
      betray his state.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, put up that watch. Impatience serves nothing,&rdquo; he said,
      half-turning hastily to his brother behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippias relinquished his pulse and mildly groaned: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no nightmare,
      this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His remark was unheard, and the bearing of it remained obscure. Adrian&rsquo;s
      pen made a louder flourish on his manuscript; whether in commiseration or
      infernal glee, none might say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you writing?&rdquo; the baronet inquired testily of Adrian, after a
      pause; twitched, it may be, by a sort of jealousy of the wise youth&rsquo;s
      coolness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I disturb you, sir?&rdquo; rejoined Adrian. &ldquo;I am engaged on a portion of a
      Proposal for uniting the Empires and Kingdoms of Europe under one Paternal
      Head, on the model of the ever-to-be-admired and lamented Holy Roman. This
      treats of the management of Youths and Maids, and of certain magisterial
      functions connected therewith. &lsquo;It is decreed that these officers be all
      and every men of science,&rsquo; etc.&rdquo; And Adrian cheerily drove his pen afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doria took Lucy&rsquo;s hand, mutely addressing encouragement to her, and
      Lucy brought as much of a smile as she could command to reply with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear we must give him up to-night,&rdquo; observed Lady Blandish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he said he would come, he will come,&rdquo; Sir Austin interjected. Between
      him and the lady there was something of a contest secretly going on. He
      was conscious that nothing save perfect success would now hold this
      self-emancipating mind. She had seen him through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He declared to me he would be certain to come,&rdquo; said Ripton; but he could
      look at none of them as he said it, for he was growing aware that Richard
      might have deceived him, and was feeling like a black conspirator against
      their happiness. He determined to tell the baronet what he knew, if
      Richard did not come by twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the time?&rdquo; he asked Hippias in a modest voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time for me to be in bed,&rdquo; growled Hippias, as if everybody present had
      been treating him badly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry came in to apprise Lucy that she was wanted above. She quietly
      rose. Sir Austin kissed her on the forehead, saying: &ldquo;You had better not
      come down again, my child.&rdquo; She kept her eyes on him. &ldquo;Oblige me by
      retiring for the night,&rdquo; he added. Lucy shook their hands, and went out,
      accompanied by Mrs. Doria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This agitation will be bad for the child,&rdquo; he said, speaking to himself
      aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Blandish remarked: &ldquo;I think she might just as well have returned. She
      will not sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will control herself for the child&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask too much of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of her, not,&rdquo; he emphasized.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was twelve o&rsquo;clock when Hippies shut his watch, and said with
      vehemence: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced my circulation gradually and steadily
      decreases!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going back to the pre-Harvey period!&rdquo; murmured Adrian as he wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin and Lady Blandish knew well that any comment would introduce
      them to the interior of his machinery, the eternal view of which was
      sufficiently harrowing; so they maintained a discreet reserve. Taking it
      for acquiescence in his deplorable condition, Hippies resumed
      despairingly: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact. I&rsquo;ve brought you to see that. No one can be
      more moderate than I am, and yet I get worse. My system is organically
      sound&mdash;I believe: I do every possible thing, and yet I get worse.
      Nature never forgives! I&rsquo;ll go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Dyspepsy departed unconsoled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin took up his brother&rsquo;s thought: &ldquo;I suppose nothing short of a
      miracle helps us when we have offended her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing short of a quack satisfies us,&rdquo; said Adrian, applying wax to an
      envelope of official dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ripton sat accusing his soul of cowardice while they talked; haunted by
      Lucy&rsquo;s last look at him. He got up his courage presently and went round to
      Adrian, who, after a few whispered words, deliberately rose and
      accompanied him out of the room, shrugging. When they had gone, Lady
      Blandish said to the baronet: &ldquo;He is not coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, then, if not tonight,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But I say he will come
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do really wish to see him united to his wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question made the baronet raise his brows with some displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you ask me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said, the ungenerous woman, &ldquo;your System will require no further
      sacrifices from either of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he did answer, it was to say: &ldquo;I think her altogether a superior
      person. I confess I should scarcely have hoped to find one like her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admit that your science does not accomplish everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: it was presumptuous&mdash;beyond a certain point,&rdquo; said the baronet,
      meaning deep things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Blandish eyed him. &ldquo;Ah me!&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;if we would always be true
      to our own wisdom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very singular to-night, Emmeline.&rdquo; Sir Austin stopped his walk in
      front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, was she not unjust? Here was an offending son freely forgiven.
      Here was a young woman of humble birth, freely accepted into his family
      and permitted to stand upon her qualities. Who would have done more&mdash;or
      as much? This lady, for instance, had the case been hers, would have
      fought it. All the people of position that he was acquainted with would
      have fought it, and that without feeling it so peculiarly. But while the
      baronet thought this, he did not think of the exceptional education his
      son had received. He, took the common ground of fathers, forgetting his
      System when it was absolutely on trial. False to his son it could not be
      said that he had been false to his System he was. Others saw it plainly,
      but he had to learn his lesson by and by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Blandish gave him her face; then stretched her hand to the table,
      saying, &ldquo;Well! well!&rdquo; She fingered a half-opened parcel lying there, and
      drew forth a little book she recognized. &ldquo;Ha! what is this?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benson returned it this morning,&rdquo; he informed her. &ldquo;The stupid fellow
      took it away with him&mdash;by mischance, I am bound to believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was nothing other than the old Note-book. Lady Blandish turned over the
      leaves, and came upon the later jottings.
    </p>
    <p>
      She read: &ldquo;A maker of Proverbs&mdash;what is he but a narrow mind with the
      mouthpiece of narrower?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not agree with that,&rdquo; she observed. He was in no humour for
      argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was your humility feigned when you wrote it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He merely said: &ldquo;Consider the sort of minds influenced by set sayings. A
      proverb is the half-way-house to an Idea, I conceive; and the majority
      rest there content: can the keeper of such a house be flattered by his
      company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt her feminine intelligence swaying under him again. There must be
      greatness in a man who could thus speak of his own special and admirable
      aptitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further she read, &ldquo;Which is the coward among us?&mdash;He who sneers at
      the failings of Humanity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that is true! How much I admire that!&rdquo; cried the dark-eyed dame as
      she beamed intellectual raptures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another Aphorism seemed closely to apply to him: &ldquo;There is no more
      grievous sight, as there is no greater perversion, than a wise man at the
      mercy of his feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have written it,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;when he had himself for an
      example&mdash;strange man that he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Blandish was still inclined to submission, though decidedly
      insubordinate. She had once been fairly conquered: but if what she
      reverenced as a great mind could conquer her, it must be a great man that
      should hold her captive. The Autumn Primrose blooms for the loftiest
      manhood; is a vindictive flower in lesser hands. Nevertheless Sir Austin
      had only to be successful, and this lady&rsquo;s allegiance was his for ever.
      The trial was at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said again: &ldquo;He is not coming to-night,&rdquo; and the baronet, on whose
      visage a contemplative pleased look had been rising for a minute past,
      quietly added: &ldquo;He is come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard&rsquo;s voice was heard in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was commotion all over the house at the return of the young heir.
      Berry, seizing every possible occasion to approach his Bessy now that her
      involuntary coldness had enhanced her value&mdash;&ldquo;Such is men!&rdquo; as the
      soft woman reflected&mdash;Berry ascended to her and delivered the news in
      pompous tones and wheedling gestures. &ldquo;The best word you&rsquo;ve spoke for many
      a day,&rdquo; says she, and leaves him unfee&rsquo;d, in an attitude, to hurry and
      pour bliss into Lucy&rsquo;s ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord be praised!&rdquo; she entered the adjoining room exclaiming, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re got
      to be happy at last. They men have come to their senses. I could cry to
      your Virgin and kiss your Cross, you sweet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; Lucy admonished her, and crooned over the child on her knees. The
      tiny open hands, full of sleep, clutched; the large blue eyes started
      awake; and his mother, all trembling and palpitating, knowing, but
      thirsting to hear it, covered him with her tresses, and tried to still her
      frame, and rocked, and sang low, interdicting even a whisper from bursting
      Mrs. Berry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard had come. He was under his father&rsquo;s roof, in the old home that had
      so soon grown foreign to him. He stood close to his wife and child. He
      might embrace them both: and now the fulness of his anguish and the
      madness of the thing he had done smote the young man: now first he tasted
      hard earthly misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had not God spoken to him in the tempest? Had not the finger of heaven
      directed him homeward? And he had come: here he stood: congratulations
      were thick in his ears: the cup of happiness was held to him, and he was
      invited to drink of it. Which was the dream? his work for the morrow, or
      this? But for a leaden load that he felt like a bullet in his breast, he
      might have thought the morrow with death sitting on it was the dream. Yes;
      he was awake. Now first the cloud of phantasms cleared away: he beheld his
      real life, and the colours of true human joy: and on the morrow perhaps he
      was to close his eyes on them. That leaden bullet dispersed all
      unrealities.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood about him in the hall, his father, Lady Blandish, Mrs. Doria,
      Adrian, Ripton; people who had known him long. They shook his hand: they
      gave him greetings he had never before understood the worth of or the
      meaning. Now that he did they mocked him. There was Mrs. Berry in the
      background bobbing, there was Martin Berry bowing, there was Tom Bakewell
      grinning. Somehow he loved the sight of these better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my old Penelope!&rdquo; he said, breaking through the circle of his
      relatives to go to her. &ldquo;Tom! how are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless ye, my Mr. Richard,&rdquo; whimpered Mrs. Berry, and whispered, rosily,
      &ldquo;all&rsquo;s agreeable now. She&rsquo;s waiting up in bed for ye, like a new-born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The person who betrayed most agitation was, Mrs. Doria. She held close to
      him, and eagerly studied his face and every movement, as one accustomed to
      masks. &ldquo;You are pale, Richard?&rdquo; He pleaded exhaustion. &ldquo;What detained you,
      dear?&rdquo; &ldquo;Business,&rdquo; he said. She drew him imperiously apart from the
      others. &ldquo;Richard! is it over?&rdquo; He asked what she meant. &ldquo;The dreadful
      duel, Richard.&rdquo; He looked darkly. &ldquo;Is it over? is it done, Richard?&rdquo;
       Getting no immediate answer, she continued&mdash;and such was her
      agitation that the words were shaken by pieces from her mouth: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      pretend not to understand me, Richard! Is it over? Are you going to die
      the death of my child&mdash;Clare&rsquo;s death? Is not one in a family enough?
      Think of your dear young wife&mdash;we love her so!&mdash;your child!&mdash;your
      father! Will you kill us all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doria had chanced to overhear a trifle of Ripton&rsquo;s communication to
      Adrian, and had built thereon with the dark forces of a stricken soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wondering how this woman could have divined it, Richard calmly said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      arranged&mdash;the matter you allude to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&mdash;truly, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me&rdquo;&mdash;but he broke away from her, saying: &ldquo;You shall hear the
      particulars to-morrow,&rdquo; and she, not alive to double meaning just then,
      allowed him to leave her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had eaten nothing for twelve hours, and called for food, but he would
      take only dry bread and claret, which was served on a tray in the library.
      He said, without any show of feeling, that he must eat before he saw the
      young hope of Raynham: so there he sat, breaking bread, and eating great
      mouthfuls, and washing them down with wine, talking of what they would.
      His father&rsquo;s studious mind felt itself years behind him, he was so
      completely altered. He had the precision of speech, the bearing of a man
      of thirty. Indeed he had all that the necessity for cloaking an infinite
      misery gives. But let things be as they might, he was, there. For one
      night in his life Sir Austin&rsquo;s perspective of the future was bounded by
      the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will your go to your wife now?&rdquo; he had asked and Richard had replied with
      a strange indifference. The baronet thought it better that their meeting
      should be private, and sent word for Lucy to wait upstairs. The others
      perceived that father and son should now be left alone. Adrian went up to
      him, and said: &ldquo;I can no longer witness this painful sight, so Good-night,
      Sir Famish! You may cheat yourself into the belief that you&rsquo;ve made a
      meal, but depend upon it your progeny&mdash;and it threatens to be
      numerous&mdash;will cry aloud and rue the day. Nature never forgives! A
      lost dinner can never be replaced! Good-night, my dear boy. And here&mdash;oblige
      me by taking this,&rdquo; he handed Richard the enormous envelope containing
      what he had written that evening. &ldquo;Credentials!&rdquo; he exclaimed humorously,
      slapping Richard on the shoulder. Ripton heard also the words &ldquo;propagator&mdash;species,&rdquo;
       but had no idea of their import. The wise youth looked: You see we&rsquo;ve made
      matters all right for you here, and quitted the room on that unusual gleam
      of earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard shook his hand, and Ripton&rsquo;s. Then Lady Blandish said her
      good-night, praising Lucy, and promising to pray for their mutual
      happiness. The two men who knew what was hanging over him, spoke together
      outside. Ripton was for getting a positive assurance that the duel would
      not be fought, but Adrian said: &ldquo;Time enough tomorrow. He&rsquo;s safe enough
      while he&rsquo;s here. I&rsquo;ll stop it to-morrow:&rdquo; ending with banter of Ripton and
      allusions to his adventures with Miss Random, which must, Adrian said,
      have led him into many affairs of the sort. Certainly Richard was there,
      and while he was there he must be safe. So thought Ripton, and went to his
      bed. Mrs. Doria deliberated likewise, and likewise thought him safe while
      he was there. For once in her life she thought it better not to trust to
      her instinct, for fear of useless disturbance where peace should be. So
      she said not a syllable of it to her brother. She only looked more deeply
      into Richard&rsquo;s eyes, as she kissed him, praising Lucy. &ldquo;I have found a
      second daughter in her, dear. Oh! may you both be happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all praised Lucy, now. His father commenced the moment they were
      alone. &ldquo;Poor Helen! Your wife has been a great comfort to her, Richard. I
      think Helen must have sunk without her. So lovely a young person,
      possessing mental faculty, and a conscience for her duties, I have never
      before met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wished to gratify his son by these eulogies of Lucy, and some hours
      back he would have succeeded. Now it had the contrary effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You compliment me on my choice, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard spoke sedately, but the irony was perceptible and he could speak
      no other way, his bitterness was so intense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you very fortunate,&rdquo; said his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sensitive to tone and manner as he was, his ebullition of paternal feeling
      was frozen. Richard did not approach him. He leaned against the
      chimney-piece, glancing at the floor, and lifting his eyes only when he
      spoke. Fortunate! very fortunate! As he revolved his later history, and
      remembered how clearly he had seen that his father must love Lucy if he
      but knew her, and remembered his efforts to persuade her to come with him,
      a sting of miserable rage blackened his brain. But could he blame that
      gentle soul? Whom could he blame? Himself? Not utterly. His father? Yes,
      and no. The blame was here, the blame was there: it was everywhere and
      nowhere, and the young man cast it on the Fates, and looked angrily at
      heaven, and grew reckless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; said his father, coming close to him, &ldquo;it is late to-night. I
      do not wish Lucy to remain in expectation longer, or I should have
      explained myself to you thoroughly, and I think&mdash;or at least hope&mdash;you
      would have justified me. I had cause to believe that you had not only
      violated my confidence, but grossly deceived me. It was not so, I now
      know. I was mistaken. Much of our misunderstanding has resulted from that
      mistake. But you were married&mdash;a boy: you knew nothing of the world,
      little of yourself. To save you in after-life&mdash;for there is a period
      when mature men and women who have married young are more impelled to
      temptation than in youth,&mdash;though not so exposed to it,&mdash;to save
      you, I say, I decreed that you should experience self-denial and learn
      something of your fellows of both sexes, before settling into a state that
      must have been otherwise precarious, however excellent the woman who is
      your mate. My System with you would have been otherwise imperfect, and you
      would have felt the effects of it. It is over now. You are a man. The
      dangers to which your nature was open are, I trust, at an end. I wish you
      to be happy, and I give you both my blessing, and pray God to conduct and
      strengthen you both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin&rsquo;s mind was unconscious of not having spoken devoutly. True or
      not, his words were idle to his son: his talk of dangers over, and
      happiness, mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard coldly took his father&rsquo;s extended hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go to her,&rdquo; said the baronet. &ldquo;I will leave you at her door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not moving: looking fixedly at his father with a hard face on which the
      colour rushed, Richard said: &ldquo;A husband who has been unfaithful to his
      wife may go to her there, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was horrible, it was cruel: Richard knew that. He wanted no advice on
      such a matter, having fully resolved what to do. Yesterday he would have
      listened to his father, and blamed himself alone, and done what was to be
      done humbly before God and her: now in the recklessness of his misery he
      had as little pity for any other soul as for his own. Sir Austin&rsquo;s brows
      were deep drawn down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clearly his intelligence had taken it, but this&mdash;the worst he could
      hear&mdash;this that he had dreaded once and doubted, and smoothed over,
      and cast aside&mdash;could it be?
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard said: &ldquo;I told you all but the very words when we last parted. What
      else do you think would have kept me from her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Angered at his callous aspect, his father cried: &ldquo;What brings you to her
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be between us two,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin fell into his chair. Meditation was impossible. He spoke from a
      wrathful heart: &ldquo;You will not dare to take her without&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; Richard interrupted him, &ldquo;I shall not. Have no fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you did not love your wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I not?&rdquo; A smile passed faintly over Richard&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you care so much for this&mdash;this other person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much? If you ask me whether I had affection for her, I can say I had
      none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O base human nature! Then how? then why? A thousand questions rose in the
      baronet&rsquo;s mind. Bessy Berry could have answered them every one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child! poor child!&rdquo; he apostrophized Lucy, pacing the room. Thinking
      of her, knowing her deep love for his son&mdash;her true forgiving heart&mdash;it
      seemed she should be spared this misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      He proposed to Richard to spare her. Vast is the distinction between women
      and men in this one sin, he said, and supported it with physical and moral
      citations. His argument carried him so far, that to hear him one would
      have imagined he thought the sin in men small indeed. His words were idle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must know it,&rdquo; said Richard, sternly. &ldquo;I will go to her now, sir, if
      you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Austin detained him, expostulated, contradicted himself, confounded
      his principles, made nonsense of all his theories. He could not induce his
      son to waver in his resolve. Ultimately, their good-night being
      interchanged, he understood that the happiness of Raynham depended on
      Lucy&rsquo;s mercy. He had no fears of her sweet heart, but it was a strange
      thing to have come to. On which should the accusation fall&mdash;on
      science, or on human nature?
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained in the library pondering over the question, at times breathing
      contempt for his son, and again seized with unwonted suspicion of his own
      wisdom: troubled, much to be pitied, even if he deserved that blow from
      his son which had plunged him into wretchedness. Richard went straight to
      Tom Bakewell, roused the heavy sleeper, and told him to have his mare
      saddled and waiting at the park gates East within an hour. Tom&rsquo;s nearest
      approach to a hero was to be a faithful slave to his master, and in doing
      this he acted to his conception of that high and glorious character. He
      got up and heroically dashed his head into cold water. &ldquo;She shall be
      ready, sir,&rdquo; he nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom! if you don&rsquo;t see me back here at Raynham, your money will go on
      being paid to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather see you than the money, Mr. Richard,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will always watch and see no harm comes to her, Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Richard, sir?&rdquo; Tom stared. &ldquo;God bless me, Mr. Richard&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No questions. You&rsquo;ll do what I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, sir; that I will. Did&rsquo;n Isle o&rsquo; Wight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The very name of the Island shocked Richard&rsquo;s blood; and he had to walk up
      and down before he could knock at Lucy&rsquo;s door. That infamous conspiracy to
      which he owed his degradation and misery scarce left him the feelings of a
      man when he thought of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soft beloved voice responded to his knock. He opened the door, and
      stood before her. Lucy was half-way toward him. In the moment that passed
      ere she was in his arms, he had time to observe the change in her. He had
      left her a girl: he beheld a woman&mdash;a blooming woman: for pale at
      first, no sooner did she see him than the colour was rich and deep on her
      face and neck and bosom half shown through the loose dressing-robe, and
      the sense of her exceeding beauty made his heart thump and his eyes swim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling!&rdquo; each cried, and they clung together, and her mouth was
      fastened on his.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spoke no more. His soul was drowned in her kiss. Supporting her,
      whose strength was gone, he, almost as weak as she, hung over her, and
      clasped her closer, closer, till they were as one body, and in the
      oblivion her lips put upon him he was free to the bliss of her embrace.
      Heaven granted him that. He placed her in a chair and knelt at her feet
      with both arms around her. Her bosom heaved; her eyes never quitted him:
      their light as the light on a rolling wave. This young creature, commonly
      so frank and straightforward, was broken with bashfulness in her husband&rsquo;s
      arms&mdash;womanly bashfulness on the torrent of womanly love; tenfold
      more seductive than the bashfulness of girlhood. Terrible tenfold the loss
      of her seemed now, as distantly&mdash;far on the horizon of memory&mdash;the
      fatal truth returned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lose her? lose this? He looked up as if to ask God to confirm it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same sweet blue eyes! the eyes that he had often seen in the dying
      glories of evening; on him they dwelt, shifting, and fluttering, and
      glittering, but constant: the light of them as the light on a rolling
      wave.
    </p>
    <p>
      And true to him! true, good, glorious, as the angels of heaven! And his
      she was! a woman&mdash;his wife! The temptation to take her, and be dumb,
      was all powerful: the wish to die against her bosom so strong as to be the
      prayer of his vital forces. Again he strained her to him, but this time it
      was as a robber grasps priceless treasure&mdash;with exultation and
      defiance. One instant of this. Lucy, whose pure tenderness had now
      surmounted the first wild passion of their meeting, bent back her head
      from her surrendered body, and said almost voicelessly, her underlids
      wistfully quivering: &ldquo;Come and see him&mdash;baby;&rdquo; and then in great hope
      of the happiness she was going to give her husband, and share with him,
      and in tremour and doubt of what his feelings would be, she blushed, and
      her brows worked: she tried to throw off the strangeness of a year of
      separation, misunderstanding, and uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling! come and see him. He is here.&rdquo; She spoke more clearly, though no
      louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard had released her, and she took his hand, and he suffered himself
      to be led to the other side of the bed. His heart began rapidly throbbing
      at the sight of a little rosy-curtained cot covered with lace like milky
      summer cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him he would lose his manhood if he looked on that child&rsquo;s
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he cried suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy turned first to him, and then to her infant, fearing it should have
      been disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy, come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, darling?&rdquo; said she, in alarm at his voice and the grip he had
      unwittingly given her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      O God! what an Ordeal was this! that to-morrow he must face death, perhaps
      die and be torn from his darling&mdash;his wife and his child; and that
      ere he went forth, ere he could dare to see his child and lean his head
      reproachfully on his young wife&rsquo;s breast&mdash;for the last time, it might
      be&mdash;he must stab her to the heart, shatter the image she held of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy!&rdquo; She saw him wrenched with agony, and her own face took the
      whiteness of his&mdash;she bending forward to him, all her faculties
      strung to hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held her two hands that she might look on him and not spare the
      horrible wound he was going to lay open to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy. Do you know why I came to you to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved her lips repeating his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy. Have you guessed why I did not come before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her head shook widened eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy. I did not come because I was not worthy of my wife! Do you
      understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; she faltered plaintively, and hung crouching under him, &ldquo;what
      have I done to make you angry with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O beloved!&rdquo; cried he, the tears bursting out of his eyes. &ldquo;O beloved!&rdquo;
       was all he could say, kissing her hands passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited, reassured, but in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy. I stayed away from you&mdash;I could not come to you, because... I
      dared not come to you, my wife, my beloved! I could not come because I was
      a coward: because&mdash;hear me&mdash;this was the reason: I have broken
      my marriage oath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again her lips moved. She caught at a dim fleshless meaning in them. &ldquo;But
      you love me? Richard! My husband! you love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I have never loved, I never shall love, woman but you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling! Kiss me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you understood what I have told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not join lips. &ldquo;I have come to you to-night to ask your
      forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her answer was: &ldquo;Kiss me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you forgive a man so base?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you love me, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: that I can say before God. I love you, and I have betrayed you, and
      am unworthy of you&mdash;not worthy to touch your hand, to kneel at your
      feet, to breathe the same air with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes shone brilliantly. &ldquo;You love me! you love me, darling!&rdquo; And as
      one who has sailed through dark fears into daylight, she said: &ldquo;My
      husband! my darling! you will never leave me? We never shall be parted
      again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew his breath painfully. To smooth her face growing rigid with fresh
      fears at his silence, he met her mouth. That kiss in which she spoke what
      her soul had to say, calmed her, and she smiled happily from it, and in
      her manner reminded him of his first vision of her on the summer morning
      in the field of the meadow-sweet. He held her to him, and thought then of
      a holier picture: of Mother and Child: of the sweet wonders of life she
      had made real to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he not absolved his conscience? At least the pangs to come made him
      think so. He now followed her leading hand. Lucy whispered: &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t
      disturb him&mdash;mustn&rsquo;t touch him, dear!&rdquo; and with dainty fingers drew
      off the covering to the little shoulder. One arm of the child was out
      along the pillow; the small hand open. His baby-mouth was pouted full; the
      dark lashes of his eyes seemed to lie on his plump cheeks. Richard stooped
      lower down to him, hungering for some movement as a sign that he lived.
      Lucy whispered. &ldquo;He sleeps like you, Richard&mdash;one arm under his
      head.&rdquo; Great wonder, and the stir of a grasping tenderness was in Richard.
      He breathed quick and soft, bending lower, till Lucy&rsquo;s curls, as she
      nestled and bent with him, rolled on the crimson quilt of the cot. A smile
      went up the plump cheeks: forthwith the bud of a mouth was in rapid
      motion. The young mother whispered, blushing: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dreaming of me,&rdquo; and
      the simple words did more than Richard&rsquo;s eyes to make him see what was.
      Then Lucy began to hum and buzz sweet baby-language, and some of the tiny
      fingers stirred, and he made as if to change his cosy position, but
      reconsidered, and deferred it, with a peaceful little sigh. Lucy
      whispered: &ldquo;He is such a big fellow. Oh! when you see him awake he is so
      like you, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not hear her immediately: it seemed a bit of heaven dropped there
      in his likeness: the more human the fact of the child grew the more
      heavenly it seemed. His son! his child! should he ever see him awake? At
      the thought, he took the words that had been spoken, and started from the
      dream he had been in. &ldquo;Will he wake soon, Lucy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! not yet, dear: not for hours. I would have kept him awake for you,
      but he was so sleepy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard stood back from the cot. He thought that if he saw the eyes of his
      boy, and had him once on his heart, he never should have force to leave
      him. Then he looked down on him, again struggled to tear himself away. Two
      natures warred in his bosom, or it may have been the Magian Conflict still
      going on. He had come to see his child once and to make peace with his
      wife before it should be too late. Might he not stop with them? Might he
      not relinquish that devilish pledge? Was not divine happiness here offered
      to him?&mdash;If foolish Ripton had not delayed to tell him of his
      interview with Mountfalcon all might have been well. But pride said it was
      impossible. And then injury spoke. For why was he thus base and spotted to
      the darling of his love? A mad pleasure in the prospect of wreaking
      vengeance on the villain who had laid the trap for him, once more
      blackened his brain. If he would stay he could not. So he resolved,
      throwing the burden on Fate. The struggle was over, but oh, the pain!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy beheld the tears streaming hot from his face on the child&rsquo;s cot. She
      marvelled at such excess of emotion. But when his chest heaved, and the
      extremity of mortal anguish appeared to have seized him, her heart sank,
      and she tried to get him in her arms. He turned away from her and went to
      the window. A half-moon was over the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you remember our rowing there one night, and we saw
      the shadow of the cypress? I wish I could have come early to-night that we
      might have had another row, and I have heard you sing there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;will it make you happier if I go with you now? I
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Lucy. Lucy, you are brave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! that I&rsquo;m not. I thought so once. I know I am not now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! to have lived&mdash;the child on your heart&mdash;and never to have
      uttered a complaint!&mdash;you are brave. O my Lucy! my wife! you that
      have made me man! I called you a coward. I remember it. I was the coward&mdash;I
      the wretched vain fool! Darling! I am going to leave you now. You are
      brave, and you will bear it. Listen: in two days, or three, I may be back&mdash;back
      for good, if you will accept me. Promise me to go to bed quietly. Kiss the
      child for me, and tell him his father has seen him. He will learn to speak
      soon. Will he soon speak, Lucy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dreadful suspicion kept her speechless; she could only clutch one arm of
      his with both her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going?&rdquo; she presently gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For two or three days. No more&mdash;I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going now? my husband!&rdquo; her faculties abandoned her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be brave, my Lucy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard! my darling husband! Going? What is it takes you from me?&rdquo; But
      questioning no further, she fell on her knees, and cried piteously to him
      to stay&mdash;not to leave them. Then she dragged him to the little
      sleeper, and urged him to pray by his side, and he did, but rose abruptly
      from his prayer when he had muttered a few broken words&mdash;she praying
      on with tight-strung nerves, in the faith that what she said to the
      interceding Mother above would be stronger than human hands on him. Nor
      could he go while she knelt there.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he wavered. He had not reckoned on her terrible suffering. She came to
      him, quiet. &ldquo;I knew you would remain.&rdquo; And taking his hand, innocently
      fondling it: &ldquo;Am I so changed from her he loved? You will not leave me,
      dear?&rdquo; But dread returned, and the words quavered as she spoke them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was almost vanquished by the loveliness of her womanhood. She drew his
      hand to her heart, and strained it there under one breast. &ldquo;Come: lie on
      my heart,&rdquo; she murmured with a smile of holy sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wavered more, and drooped to her, but summoning the powers of hell,
      kissed her suddenly, cried the words of parting, and hurried to the door.
      It was over in an instant. She cried out his name, clinging to him wildly,
      and was adjured to be brave, for he would be dishonoured if he did not go.
      Then she was shaken off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Berry was aroused by an unusual prolonged wailing of the child, which
      showed that no one was comforting it, and failing to get any answer to her
      applications for admittance, she made bold to enter. There she saw Lucy,
      the child in her lap, sitting on the floor senseless:&mdash;she had taken
      it from its sleep and tried to follow her husband with it as her strongest
      appeal to him, and had fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh my! oh my!&rdquo; Mrs. Berry moaned, &ldquo;and I just now thinkin&rsquo; they was so
      happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Warming and caressing the poor infant, she managed by degrees to revive
      Lucy, and heard what had brought her to that situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to his father,&rdquo; said Mrs. Berry. &ldquo;Ta-te-tiddle-te-heighty-O! Go, my
      love, and every horse in Raynham shall be out after &lsquo;m. This is what men
      brings us to! Heighty-oighty-iddlety-Ah! Or you take blessed baby, and
      I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baronet himself knocked at the door. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I heard
      a noise and a step descend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Richard have gone, Sir Austin! have gone from his wife and babe!
      Rum-te-um-te-iddledy&mdash;Oh, my goodness! what sorrow&rsquo;s come on us!&rdquo; and
      Mrs. Berry wept, and sang to baby, and baby cried vehemently, and Lucy,
      sobbing, took him and danced him and sang to him with drawn lips and tears
      dropping over him. And if the Scientific Humanist to the day of his death
      forgets the sight of those two poor true women jigging on their wretched
      hearts to calm the child, he must have very little of the human in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no more sleep for Raynham that night.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLV
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His ordeal is over. I have just come from his room and seen him bear the
      worst that could be. Return at once&mdash;he has asked for you. I can
      hardly write intelligibly, but I will tell you what we know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two days after the dreadful night when he left us, his father heard from
      Ralph Morton. Richard had fought a duel in France with Lord Mountfalcon,
      and was lying wounded at a hamlet on the coast. His father started
      immediately with his poor wife, and I followed in company with his aunt
      and his child. The wound was not dangerous. He was shot in the side
      somewhere, but the ball injured no vital part. We thought all would be
      well. Oh! how sick I am of theories, and Systems, and the pretensions of
      men! There was his son lying all but dead, and the man was still
      unconvinced of the folly he had been guilty of. I could hardly bear the
      sight of his composure. I shall hate the name of Science till the day I
      die. Give me nothing but commonplace unpretending people!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were at a wretched French cabaret, smelling vilely, where we still
      remain, and the people try as much as they can do to compensate for our
      discomforts by their kindness. The French poor people are very considerate
      where they see suffering. I will say that for them. The doctors had not
      allowed his poor Lucy to go near him. She sat outside his door, and none
      of us dared disturb her. That was a sight for Science. His father and
      myself, and Mrs. Berry, were the only ones permitted to wait on him, and
      whenever we came out, there she sat, not speaking a word&mdash;for she had
      been told it would endanger his life&mdash;but she looked such awful
      eagerness. She had the sort of eye I fancy mad persons have. I was sure
      her reason was going. We did everything we could think of to comfort her.
      A bed was made up for her and her meals were brought to her there. Of
      course there was no getting her to eat. What do you suppose his alarm was
      fixed on? He absolutely said to me&mdash;but I have not patience to repeat
      his words. He thought her to blame for not commanding herself for the sake
      of her maternal duties. He had absolutely an idea of insisting that she
      should make an effort to suckle the child. I shall love that Mrs. Berry to
      the end of my days. I really believe she has twice the sense of any of us&mdash;Science
      and all. She asked him plainly if he wished to poison the child, and then
      he gave way, but with a bad grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor man! perhaps I am hard on him. I remember that you said Richard had
      done wrong. Yes; well, that may be. But his father eclipsed his wrong in a
      greater wrong&mdash;a crime, or quite as bad; for if he deceived himself
      in the belief that he was acting righteously in separating husband and
      wife, and exposing his son as he did, I can only say that there are some
      who are worse than people who deliberately commit crimes. No doubt Science
      will benefit by it. They kill little animals for the sake of Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have with us Doctor Bairam, and a French physician from Dieppe, a very
      skilful man. It was he who told us where the real danger lay. We thought
      all would be well. A week had passed, and no fever supervened. We told
      Richard that his wife was coming to him, and he could bear to hear it. I
      went to her and began to circumlocute, thinking she listened&mdash;she had
      the same eager look. When I told her she might go in with me to see her
      dear husband, her features did not change. M. Despres, who held her pulse
      at the time, told me, in a whisper, it was cerebral fever&mdash;brain
      fever coming on. We have talked of her since. I noticed that though she
      did not seem to understand me, her bosom heaved, and she appeared to be
      trying to repress it, and choke something. I am sure now, from what I know
      of her character, that she&mdash;even in the approaches of delirium&mdash;was
      preventing herself from crying out. Her last hold of reason was a thought
      for Richard. It was against a creature like this that we plotted! I have
      the comfort of knowing that I did my share in helping to destroy her. Had
      she seen her husband a day or two before&mdash;but no! there was a new
      System to interdict that! Or had she not so violently controlled her
      nature as she did, I believe she might have been saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said once of a man, that his conscience was a coxcomb. Will you
      believe that when he saw his son&rsquo;s wife&mdash;poor victim! lying
      delirious, he could not even then see his error. You said he wished to
      take Providence out of God&rsquo;s hands. His mad self-deceit would not leave
      him. I am positive, that while he was standing over her, he was blaming
      her for not having considered the child. Indeed he made a remark to me
      that it was unfortunate &lsquo;disastrous,&rsquo; I think he said&mdash;that the child
      should have to be fed by hand. I dare say it is. All I pray is that this
      young child may be saved from him. I cannot bear to see him look on it. He
      does not spare himself bodily fatigue&mdash;but what is that? that is the
      vulgarest form of love. I know what you will say. You will say I have lost
      all charity, and I have. But I should not feel so, Austin, if I could be
      quite sure that he is an altered man even now the blow has struck him. He
      is reserved and simple in his speech, and his grief is evident, but I have
      doubts. He heard her while she was senseless call him cruel and harsh, and
      cry that she had suffered, and I saw then his mouth contract as if he had
      been touched. Perhaps, when he thinks, his mind will be clearer, but what
      he has done cannot be undone. I do not imagine he will abuse women any
      more. The doctor called her a &lsquo;forte et belle jeune femme:&rsquo; and he said
      she was as noble a soul as ever God moulded clay upon. A noble soul &lsquo;forte
      et belle!&rsquo; She lies upstairs. If he can look on her and not see his sin, I
      almost fear God will never enlighten him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She died five days after she had been removed. The shock had utterly
      deranged her. I was with her. She died very quietly, breathing her last
      breath without pain&mdash;asking for no one&mdash;a death I should like to
      die.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her cries at one time were dreadfully loud. She screamed that she was
      &lsquo;drowning in fire,&rsquo; and that her husband would not come to her to save
      her. We deadened the sound as much as we could, but it was impossible to
      prevent Richard from hearing. He knew her voice, and it produced an effect
      like fever on him. Whenever she called he answered. You could not hear
      them without weeping. Mrs. Berry sat with her, and I sat with him, and his
      father moved from one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the trial for us came when she was gone. How to communicate it to
      Richard&mdash;or whether to do so at all! His father consulted with us. We
      were quite decided that it would be madness to breathe it while he was in
      that state. I can admit now&mdash;as things have turned out&mdash;we were
      wrong. His father left us&mdash;I believe he spent the time in prayer&mdash;and
      then leaning on me, he went to Richard, and said in so many words, that
      his Lucy was no more. I thought it must kill him. He listened, and smiled.
      I never saw a smile so sweet and so sad. He said he had seen her die, as
      if he had passed through his suffering a long time ago. He shut his eyes.
      I could see by the motion of his eyeballs up that he was straining his
      sight to some inner heaven.&mdash;I cannot go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Richard is safe. Had we postponed the tidings, till he came to
      his clear senses, it must have killed him. His father was right for once,
      then. But if he has saved his son&rsquo;s body, he has given the death-blow to
      his heart. Richard will never be what he promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter found on his clothes tells us the origin of the quarrel. I have
      had an interview with Lord M. this morning. I cannot say I think him
      exactly to blame: Richard forced him to fight. At least I do not select
      him the foremost for blame. He was deeply and sincerely affected by the
      calamity he has caused. Alas! he was only an instrument. Your poor aunt is
      utterly prostrate and talks strange things of her daughter&rsquo;s death. She is
      only happy in drudging. Dr. Bairam says we must under any circumstances
      keep her employed. Whilst she is doing something, she can chat freely, but
      the moment her hands are not occupied she gives me an idea that she is
      going into a fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We expect the dear child&rsquo;s uncle to-day. Mr. Thompson is here. I have
      taken him upstairs to look at her. That poor young man has a true heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come at once. You will not be in time to see her. She will lie at
      Raynham. If you could you would see an angel. He sits by her side for
      hours. I can give you no description of her beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not delay, I know, dear Austin, and I want you, for your
      presence will make me more charitable than I find it possible to be. Have
      you noticed the expression in the eyes of blind men? That is just how
      Richard looks, as he lies there silent in his bed&mdash;striving to image
      her on his brain.&rdquo;

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
