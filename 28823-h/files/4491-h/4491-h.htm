    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. WHEREIN AN EXCURSION IS MADE IN A CELTIC MIND
    </h2>
    <p>
      A young Irish gentleman of the numerous clan O&rsquo;Donnells, and a Patrick,
      hardly a distinction of him until we know him, had bound himself, by
      purchase of a railway-ticket, to travel direct to the borders of North
      Wales, on a visit to a notable landowner of those marches, the Squire
      Adister, whose family-seat was where the hills begin to lift and spy into
      the heart of black mountains. Examining his ticket with an apparent
      curiosity, the son of a greener island debated whether it would not be
      better for him to follow his inclinations, now that he had gone so far as
      to pay for the journey, and stay. But his inclinations were also subject
      to question, upon his considering that he had expended pounds English for
      the privilege of making the journey in this very train. He asked himself
      earnestly what was the nature of the power which forced him to do it&mdash;a
      bad genius or a good: and it seemed to him a sort of answer, inasmuch as
      it silenced the contending parties, that he had been the victim of an
      impetus. True; still his present position involved a certain outlay of
      money simply, not at all his bondage to the instrument it had procured for
      him, and that was true; nevertheless, to buy a ticket to shy it away is an
      incident so uncommon, that if we can but pause to dwell on the singularity
      of the act, we are unlikely to abjure our fellowship with them who would
      not be guilty of it; and therefore, by the aid of his reflections and a
      remainder of the impetus, Mr. Patrick O&rsquo;Donnell stepped into a carriage of
      the train like any ordinary English traveller, between whom and his
      destination there is an agreement to meet if they can.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an experience of hesitating minds, be they Saxon or others, that
      when we have submitted our persons to the charge of public companies,
      immediately, as if the renouncing of our independence into their hands had
      given us a taste of a will of our own, we are eager for the performance of
      their contract to do what we are only half inclined to; the train cannot
      go fast enough to please us, though we could excuse it for breaking down;
      stoppages at stations are impertinences, and the delivery of us at last on
      the platform is an astonishment, for it is not we who have done it&mdash;we
      have not even desired it. To be imperfectly in accord with the velocity
      precipitating us upon a certain point, is to be going without our heads,
      which have so much the habit of supposing it must be whither we intend,
      when we go in a determined manner, that a doubt of it distracts the
      understanding&mdash;decapitates us; suddenly to alight, moreover, and find
      ourselves dropped at the heels of flying Time, like an unconsidered
      bundle, is anything but a reconstruction of the edifice. The natural
      revelry of the blood in speed suffers a violent shock, not to speak of our
      notion of being left behind, quite isolated and unsound. Or, if you
      insist, the condition shall be said to belong exclusively to Celtic
      nature, seeing that it had been drawn directly from a scion of one of
      those tribes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Patrick jumped from the train as headless as good St. Denis. He was
      a juvenile thinker, and to discover himself here, where he both wished and
      wished not to be, now deeming the negative sternly in the ascendant,
      flicked his imagination with awe of the influence of the railway service
      upon the destinies of man. Settling a mental debate about a backward
      flight, he drove across the land so foreign to his eyes and affections,
      and breasted a strong tide of wishes that it were in a contrary direction.
      He would rather have looked upon the desert under a sand-storm, or upon a
      London suburb yet he looked thirstingly. Each variation of landscape of
      the curved highway offered him in a moment decisive features: he fitted
      them to a story he knew: the whole circle was animated by a couple of pale
      mounted figures beneath no happy light. For this was the air once breathed
      by Adiante Adister, his elder brother Philip&rsquo;s love and lost love: here
      she had been to Philip flame along the hill-ridges, his rose-world in the
      dust-world, the saintly in his earthly. And how had she rewarded him for
      that reverential love of her? She had forborne to kill him. The bitter
      sylph of the mountain lures men to climb till she winds them in vapour and
      leaves them groping, innocent of the red crags below. The delicate thing
      had not picked his bones: Patrick admitted it; he had seen his brother
      hale and stout not long back. But oh! she was merciless, she was a witch.
      If ever queen-witch was, she was the crowned one!
    </p>
    <p>
      For a personal proof, now: he had her all round him in a strange district
      though he had never cast eye on her. Yonder bare hill she came racing up
      with a plume in the wind: she was over the long brown moor, look where he
      would: and vividly was she beside the hurrying beck where it made edges
      and chattered white. He had not seen, he could not imagine her face:
      angelic dashed with demon beauty, was his idea of the woman, and there is
      little of a portrait in that; but he was of a world where the elemental is
      more individual than the concrete, and unconceived of sight she was a
      recognised presence for the green-island brain of a youth whose manner of
      hating was to conjure her spirit from the air and let fly his own in
      pursuit of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has to be stated that the object of the youngster&rsquo;s expedition to
      Earlsfont was perfectly simple in his mind, however much it went against
      his nature to perform it. He came for the purpose of obtaining Miss
      Adister&rsquo;s Continental address; to gather what he could of her from her
      relatives, and then forthwith to proceed in search of her, that he might
      plead with her on behalf of his brother Philip, after a four years&rsquo; 
      division of the lovers. Could anything be simpler? He had familiarised
      himself with the thought of his advocacy during those four years. His
      reluctance to come would have been accountable to the Adisters by a
      sentiment of shame at his family&rsquo;s dealings with theirs: in fact, a
      military captain of the O&rsquo;Donnells had in old days played the adventurer
      and charmed a maid of a certain age into yielding her hand to him; and the
      lady was the squire of Earlsfont&rsquo;s only sister: she possessed funded
      property. Shortly after the union, as one that has achieved the goal of
      enterprise, the gallant officer retired from the service nor did
      north-western England put much to his credit the declaration of his wife&rsquo;s
      pronouncing him to be the best of husbands. She naturally said it of him
      in eulogy; his own relatives accepted it in some contempt, mixed with a
      relish of his hospitality: his wife&rsquo;s were constant in citing his gain by
      the marriage. Could he possibly have been less than that? they exclaimed.
      An excellent husband, who might easily have been less than that, he was
      the most devoted of cousins, and the liberal expenditure of his native
      eloquence for the furtherance of Philip&rsquo;s love-suit was the principal
      cause of the misfortune, if misfortune it could subsequently be called to
      lose an Adiante.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Adister family were not gifted to read into the heart of a young man
      of a fanciful turn. Patrick had not a thought of shame devolving on him
      from a kinsman that had shot at a mark and hit it. Who sees the shame of
      taking an apple from a garden of the Hesperides? And as England cultivates
      those golden, if sometimes wrinkled, fruits, it would have seemed to him,
      in thinking about it, an entirely lucky thing for the finder; while a
      question of blood would have fired his veins to rival heat of
      self-assertion, very loftily towering: there were Kings in Ireland: cry
      for one of them in Uladh and you will hear his name, and he has
      descendants yet! But the youth was not disposed unnecessarily to blazon
      his princeliness. He kept it in modest reserve, as common gentlemen keep
      their physical strength. His reluctance to look on Earlsfont sprang from
      the same source as unacknowledged craving to see the place, which had
      precipitated him thus far upon his road: he had a horror of scenes where a
      faithless girl had betrayed her lover. Love was his visionary temple, and
      his idea of love was the solitary light in it, painfully susceptible to
      coldair currents from the stories of love abroad over the world.
      Faithlessness he conceived to be obnoxious to nature; it stained the earth
      and was excommunicated; there could be no pardon of the crime, barely any
      for repentance. He conceived it in the feminine; for men are not those
      holy creatures whose conduct strikes on the soul with direct edge: a
      faithless man is but a general villain or funny monster, a subject
      rejected of poets, taking no hue in the flat chronicle of history: but a
      faithless woman, how shall we speak of her! Women, sacredly endowed with
      beauty and the wonderful vibrating note about the very mention of them,
      are criminal to hideousness when they betray. Cry, False! on them, and
      there is an instant echo of bleeding males in many circles, like the poor
      quavering flute-howl of transformed beasts, which at some remembering
      touch bewail their higher state. Those women are sovereignly attractive,
      too, loathsomely. Therein you may detect the fiend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our moralist had for some time been glancing at a broad, handsome old
      country mansion on the top of a wooded hill backed by a swarm of mountain
      heads all purple-dark under clouds flying thick to shallow, as from a
      brush of sepia. The dim silver of half-lighted lakewater shot along below
      the terrace. He knew the kind of sky, having oftener seen that than any
      other, and he knew the house before it was named to him and he had flung a
      discolouring thought across it. He contemplated it placably and
      studiously, perhaps because the shower-folding armies of the fields above
      likened its shadowed stillness to that of his Irish home. There had this
      woman lived! At the name of Earlsfont she became this witch, snake,
      deception. Earlsfont was the title and summary of her black story: the
      reverberation of the word shook up all the chapters to pour out their
      poison.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. MR. ADISTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Patrick O&rsquo;Donnell drove up to the gates of Earlsfont notwithstanding
      these emotions, upon which light matter it is the habit of men of his
      blood too much to brood; though it is for our better future to have a
      capacity for them, and the insensible race is the oxenish.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if he did so when alone, the second man residing in the Celt put that
      fellow by and at once assumed the social character on his being requested
      to follow his card into Mr. Adister&rsquo;s library. He took his impression of
      the hall that had heard her voice, the stairs she had descended, the door
      she had passed through, and the globes she had perchance laid hand on, and
      the old mappemonde, and the severely-shining orderly regiment of books
      breathing of her whether she had opened them or not, as he bowed to his
      host, and in reply to, &lsquo;So, sir! I am glad to see you,&rsquo; said swimmingly
      that Earlsfont was the first house he had visited in this country: and the
      scenery reminded him of his part of Ireland: and on landing at Holyhead he
      had gone off straight to the metropolis by appointment to meet his brother
      Philip, just returned from Canada a full captain, who heartily despatched
      his compliments and respects, and hoped to hear of perfect health in this
      quarter of the world. And Captain Con the same, and he was very
      flourishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick&rsquo;s opening speech concluded on the sound of a short laugh coming
      from Mr. Adister.
    </p>
    <p>
      It struck the young Irishman&rsquo;s ear as injurious and scornful in relation
      to Captain Con; but the remark ensuing calmed him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has no children.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir; Captain Con wasn&rsquo;t born to increase the number of our clan,&rsquo; 
      Patrick rejoined; and thought: By heaven! I get a likeness of her out of
      you, with a dash of the mother mayhap somewhere. This was his Puck-manner
      of pulling a girdle round about from what was foremost in his head to the
      secret of his host&rsquo;s quiet observation; for, guessing that such features
      as he beheld would be slumped on a handsome family, he was led by the
      splendid severity of their lines to perceive an illimitable pride in the
      man likely to punish him in his offspring, who would inherit that as well;
      so, as is the way with the livelier races, whether they seize first or
      second the matter or the spirit of what they hear, the vivid indulgence of
      his own ideas helped him to catch the right meaning by the tail, and he
      was enlightened upon a domestic unhappiness, although Mr. Adister had not
      spoken miserably. The &lsquo;dash of the mother&rsquo; was thrown in to make Adiante,
      softer, and leave a loophole for her relenting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master of Earlsfont stood for a promise of beauty in his issue,
      requiring to be softened at the mouth and along the brows, even in men. He
      was tall, and had clear Greek outlines: the lips were locked metal, thin
      as edges of steel, and his eyes, when he directed them on the person he
      addressed or the person speaking, were as little varied by motion of the
      lids as eyeballs of a stone bust. If they expressed more, because they
      were not sculptured eyes, it was the expression of his high and frigid
      nature rather than any of the diversities pertaining to sentiment and
      shades of meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have had the bequest of an estate,&rsquo; Mr. Adister said, to compliment
      him by touching on his affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A small one; not a quarter of a county,&rsquo; said Patrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Productive, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&lsquo;Tis a tramp of discovery, sir, to where bog ends and cultivation
      begins.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bequeathed to you exclusively over the head of your elder brother, I
      understand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick nodded assent. &lsquo;But my purse is Philip&rsquo;s, and my house, and my
      horses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not bequeathed by a member of your family?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By a distant cousin, chancing to have been one of my godmothers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Women do these things,&rsquo; Mr. Adister said, not in perfect approbation of
      their doings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I think too, it might have gone to the elder,&rsquo; Patrick replied to his
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not your intention to be an idle gentleman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, nor a vagrant Irishman, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You propose to sit down over there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I&rsquo;ve more brains to be of service to them and the land, I do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Adister pulled the arm of his chair. &lsquo;The professions are crammed. An
      Irish gentleman owning land might do worse. I am in favour of some degree
      of military training for all gentlemen. You hunt?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick&rsquo;s look was, &lsquo;Give me a chance&rsquo;; and Mr. Adister continued: &lsquo;Good
      runs are to be had here; you shall try them. You are something of a shot,
      I suppose. We hear of gentlemen now who neither hunt nor shoot. You
      fence?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s to say, I&rsquo;ve had lessons in the art.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not aware that there is now an art of fencing taught in Ireland.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor am I,&rsquo; said Patrick; &lsquo;though there&rsquo;s no knowing what goes on in the
      cabins.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Adister appeared to acquiesce. Observations of sly import went by him
      like the whispering wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your priests should know,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Patrick thought it well not to reply. After a pause between them,
      he referred to the fencing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was taught by a Parisian master of the art, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been to Paris?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was educated in Paris.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How? Ah!&rsquo; Mr. Adister corrected himself in the higher notes of
      recollection. &lsquo;I think I have heard something of a Jesuit seminary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Fathers did me the service to knock all I know into me, and call it
      education, by courtesy,&rsquo; said Patrick, basking in the unobscured frown of
      his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you are accustomed to speak French?&rsquo; The interrogation was put to
      extract some balm from the circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick tried his art of fence with the absurdity by saying: &lsquo;All but like
      a native.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These Jesuits taught you the use of the foils?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They allowed me the privilege of learning, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After meditation, Mr. Adister said: &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t dance?&rsquo; He said it
      speculating on the&rsquo; kind of gentleman produced in Paris by the disciples
      of Loyola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon me, sir, you hit on another of my accomplishments.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These Jesuits encourage dancing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The square dance&mdash;short of the embracing: the valse is under
      interdict.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Adister peered into his brows profoundly for a glimpse of the devilry
      in that exclusion of the valse.
    </p>
    <p>
      What object had those people in encouraging the young fellow to be a
      perfect fencer and dancer, so that he should be of the school of the
      polite world, and yet subservient to them?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thanks to the Jesuits, then, you are almost a Parisian,&rsquo; he remarked;
      provoking the retort:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thanks to them, I&rsquo;ve stored a little, and Paris is to me as pure a place
      as four whitewashed walls:&rsquo; Patrick added: &lsquo;without a shadow of a monk on
      them.&rsquo; Perhaps it was thrown in for the comfort of mundane ears afflicted
      sorely, and no point of principle pertained to the slur on a monk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Adister could have exclaimed, That shadow of the monk! had he been in
      an exclamatory mood. He said: &lsquo;They have not made a monk of you, then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick was minded to explain how that the Jesuits are a religious order
      exercising worldly weapons. The lack of precise words admonished him of
      the virtue of silence, and he retreated&mdash;with a quiet negative: &lsquo;They
      have not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, you are no Jesuit?&rsquo; he was asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking it scarcely required a response, he shrugged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would not change your religion, sir?&rsquo; said Mr. Adister in seeming
      anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick thought he would have to rise: he half fancied himself summoned to
      change his religion or depart from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not I,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not for the title of Prince?&rsquo; he was further pressed, and he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t happen to have an ambition for the title of Prince.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or any title!&rsquo; interjected Mr. Adister, &lsquo;or whatever the devil can offer!&mdash;or,&rsquo; 
      he spoke more pointedly, &lsquo;for what fools call a brilliant marriage?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My religion?&rsquo; Patrick now treated the question seriously and raised his
      head: &lsquo;I&rsquo;d not suffer myself to be asked twice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The sceptical northern-blue eyes of his host dwelt on him with their full
      repellent stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Catholic gentleman expected he might hear a frenetic zealot roar
      out: Be off!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not immediately reassured by the words &lsquo;Dead or alive, then, you
      have a father!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The spectacle of a state of excitement without a show of feeling was novel
      to Patrick. He began to see that he was not implicated in a wrath that
      referred to some great offender, and Mr. Adister soon confirmed his view
      by saying: &lsquo;You are no disgrace to your begetting, sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he quitted his chair, and hospitably proposed to conduct his
      guest over the house and grounds.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. CAROLINE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Men of the Adister family having taken to themselves brides of a very
      dusty pedigree from the Principality, there were curious rough heirlooms
      to be seen about the house, shields on the armoury walls and
      hunting-horns, and drinking-horns, and spears, and chain-belts bearing
      clasps of heads of beasts; old gold ornaments, torques, blue-stone
      necklaces, under glass-cases, were in the library; huge rings that must
      have given the wearers fearful fists; a shirt of coarse linen with a pale
      brown spot on the breast, like a fallen beech-leaf; and many sealed
      parchment-skins, very precious, for an inspection of which, as Patrick was
      bidden to understand, History humbly knocked at the Earlsfont hall-doors;
      and the proud muse made her transcripts of them kneeling. He would have
      been affected by these wonders had any relic of Adiante appeased his
      thirst. Or had there been one mention of her, it would have disengaged him
      from the incessant speculations regarding the daughter of the house, of
      whom not a word was uttered. No portrait of her was shown. Why was she
      absent from her home so long? where was she? How could her name be
      started? And was it she who was the sinner in her father&rsquo;s mind? But the
      idolatrous love between Adiante and her father was once a legend: they
      could not have been cut asunder. She had offered up her love of Philip as
      a sacrifice to it: Patrick recollected that, and now with a softer gloom
      on his brooding he released her from the burden of his grand charge of
      unfaithfulness to the truest of lovers, by acknowledging that he was in
      the presence of the sole rival of his brother. Glorious girl that she was,
      her betrayal of Philip had nothing of a woman&rsquo;s base caprice to make it
      infamous: she had sacrificed him to her reading of duty; and that was duty
      to her father; and the point of duty was in this instance rather a sacred
      one. He heard voices murmur that she might be praised. He remonstrated
      with them, assuring them, as one who knew, that a woman&rsquo;s first duty is
      her duty to her lover; her parents are her second thought. Her lover, in
      the consideration of a real soul among the shifty creatures, is her
      husband; and have we not the word of heaven directing her to submit
      herself to him who is her husband before all others? That peerless Adiante
      had previously erred in the upper sphere where she received her
      condemnation, but such a sphere is ladder and ladder and silver ladder
      high above your hair-splitting pates, you children of earth, and it is not
      for you to act on the verdict in decrying her: rather &lsquo;tis for you to
      raise hymns of worship to a saint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus did the ingenious Patrick change his ground and gain his argument
      with the celerity of one who wins a game by playing it without an
      adversary. Mr. Adister had sprung a new sense in him on the subject of the
      renunciation of the religion. No thought of a possible apostasy had ever
      occurred to the youth, and as he was aware that the difference of their
      faith had been the main cause of the division of Adiante and Philip, he
      could at least consent to think well of her down here, that is, on our
      flat surface of earth. Up there, among the immortals, he was compelled to
      shake his head at her still, and more than sadly in certain moods of
      exaltation, reprovingly; though she interested him beyond all her
      sisterhood above, it had to be confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They traversed a banqueting-hall hung with portraits, to two or three of
      which the master of Earlsfont carelessly pointed, for his guest to be
      interested in them or not as he might please. A reception-hall flung
      folding-doors on a grand drawing-room, where the fires in the grates went
      through the ceremony of warming nobody, and made a show of keeping the
      house alive. A modern steel cuirass, helmet and plume at a corner of the
      armoury reminded Mr. Adister to say that he had worn the uniform in his
      day. He cast an odd look at the old shell containing him when he was a
      brilliant youth. Patrick was marched on to Colonel Arthur&rsquo;s rooms, and to
      Captain David&rsquo;s, the sailor. Their father talked of his two sons. They
      appeared to satisfy him. If that was the case, they could hardly have
      thrown off their religion. Already Patrick had a dread of naming the
      daughter. An idea struck him that she might be the person who had been
      guilty of it over there on the Continent. What if she had done it, upon a
      review of her treatment of her lover, and gone into a convent to wait for
      Philip to come and claim her?&mdash;saying, &lsquo;Philip, I&rsquo;ve put the knife to
      my father&rsquo;s love of me; love me double&rsquo;; and so she just half swoons,
      enough to show how the dear angel looks in her sleep: a trick of kindness
      these heavenly women have, that we heathen may get a peep of their secret
      rose-enfolded selves; and dream &lsquo;s no word, nor drunken, for the blessed
      mischief it works with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supposing it so, it accounted for everything: for her absence, and her
      father&rsquo;s abstention from a mention of her, and the pretty good sort of
      welcome Patrick had received; for as yet it was unknown that she did it
      all for an O&rsquo;Donnell.
    </p>
    <p>
      These being his reflections, he at once accepted a view of her that so
      agreeably quieted his perplexity, and he leapt out of his tangle into the
      happy open spaces where the romantic things of life are as natural as the
      sun that rises and sets. There you imagine what you will; you live what
      you imagine. An Adiante meets her lover another Adiante, the phantom
      likeness of her, similar to the finger-tips, hovers to a meeting with some
      one whose heart shakes your manful frame at but a thought of it. But this
      other Adiante is altogether a secondary conception, barely descried, and
      chased by you that she may interpret the mystical nature of the happiness
      of those two, close-linked to eternity, in advance. You would learn it, if
      she would expound it; you are ready to learn it, for the sake of
      knowledge; and if you link yourself to her and do as those two are doing,
      it is chiefly in a spirit of imitation, in sympathy with the darting
      couple ahead....
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile he conversed, and seemed, to a gentleman unaware of the vaporous
      activities of his brain, a young fellow of a certain practical sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have not much to teach you in: horseflesh,&rsquo; Mr. Adister said, quitting
      the stables to proceed to the gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must look alive to keep up our breed, sir,&rsquo; said Patrick. &lsquo;We&rsquo;re
      breeding too fine: and soon we shan&rsquo;t be able to horse our troopers. I
      call that the land for horses where the cavalry&rsquo;s well-mounted on a native
      breed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have your brother&rsquo;s notions of cavalry, have you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I leave it to Philip to boast what cavalry can do on the field. He knows:
      but he knows that troopers must be mounted: and we&rsquo;re fineing more and
      more from bone: with the sales to foreigners! and the only chance of their
      not beating us is that they&rsquo;ll be so good as follow our bad example.
      Prussia&rsquo;s well horsed, and for the work it&rsquo;s intended to do, the Austrian
      light cavalry&rsquo;s a model. So I&rsquo;m told. I&rsquo;ll see for myself. Then we sit our
      horses too heavy. The Saxon trooper runs headlong to flesh. &lsquo;Tis the beer
      that fattens and swells him. Properly to speak, we&rsquo;ve no light cavalry.
      The French are studying it, and when they take to studying, they come to
      the fore. I&rsquo;ll pay a visit to their breeding establishments. We&rsquo;ve no
      studying here, and not a scrap of system that I see. All the country seems
      armed for bullying the facts, till the periodical panic arrives, and then
      it &lsquo;s for lying flat and roaring&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll drop the curtain, if you
      please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You say we,&rsquo; returned Mr. Adister. &lsquo;I hear you launched at us English by
      the captain, your cousin, who has apparently yet to learn that we are one
      people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We &lsquo;re held together and a trifle intermixed; I fancy it&rsquo;s we with him
      and with me when we&rsquo;re talking of army or navy,&rsquo; said Patrick. &lsquo;But
      Captain Con&rsquo;s a bit of a politician: a poor business, when there&rsquo;s nothing
      to be done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A very poor business!&rsquo; Mr. Adister rejoined,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you&rsquo;d have the goodness to kindle his enthusiasm, he&rsquo;d be for the
      first person plural, with his cap in the air,&rsquo; said Patrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I detest enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not obliged to adore it to give it a wakener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray, what does that mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick cast about to reply to the formal challenge for an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began on it as it surged up to him: &lsquo;Well, sir, the country that&rsquo;s got
      hold of us, if we &lsquo;re not to get loose. We don&rsquo;t count many millions in
      Europe, and there&rsquo;s no shame in submitting to force majeure, if a stand
      was once made; and we&rsquo;re mixed up, &lsquo;tis true, well or ill; and we&rsquo;re
      stronger, both of us, united than tearing to strips: and so, there, for
      the past! so long as we can set our eyes upon something to admire, instead
      of a bundle squatting fat on a pile of possessions and vowing she won&rsquo;t
      budge; and taking kicks from a big foot across the Atlantic, and shaking
      bayonets out of her mob-cap for a little one&rsquo;s cock of the eye at her: and
      she&rsquo;s all for the fleshpots, and calls the rest of mankind fools because
      they&rsquo;re not the same: and so long as she can trim her ribands and have her
      hot toast and tea, with a suspicion of a dram in it, she doesn&rsquo;t mind how
      heavy she sits: nor that &lsquo;s not the point, nor &lsquo;s the land question, nor
      the potato crop, if only she wore the right sort of face to look at, with
      a bit of brightness about it, to show an idea inside striking alight from
      the day that&rsquo;s not yet nodding at us, as the tops of big mountains do: or
      if she were only braced and gallant, and cried, Ready, though I haven&rsquo;t
      much outlook! We&rsquo;d be satisfied with her for a handsome figure. I don&rsquo;t
      know whether we wouldn&rsquo;t be satisfied with her for politeness in her
      manners. We&rsquo;d like her better for a spice of devotion to alight higher up
      in politics and religion. But the key of the difficulty&rsquo;s a sparkle of
      enthusiasm. It&rsquo;s part business, and the greater part sentiment. We want a
      rousing in the heart of us; or else we&rsquo;d be pleased with her for sitting
      so as not to overlap us entirely: we&rsquo;d feel more at home, and behold her
      more respectfully. We&rsquo;d see the policy of an honourable union, and be
      joined to you by more than a telegraphic cable. That&rsquo;s Captain Con, I
      think, and many like him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick finished his airy sketch of the Irish case in a key signifying
      that he might be one among the many, but unobtrusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stick to horses!&rsquo; observed Mr. Adister.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was pronounced as the termination to sheer maundering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick talked on the uppermost topic for the remainder of their stroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      He noticed that his host occasionally allowed himself to say, &lsquo;You Irish&rsquo;:
      and he reflected that the saying, &lsquo;You English,&rsquo; had been hinted as an
      offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He forgot to think that he had possibly provoked this alienation in a
      scornfully proud spirit. The language of metaphor was to Mr. Adister
      fool&rsquo;s froth. He conceded the use of it to the Irish and the Welsh as a
      right that stamped them for what they were by adopting it; and they might
      look on a country as a &lsquo;she,&rsquo; if it amused them: so long as they were not
      recalcitrant, they were to be tolerated, they were a part of us; doubtless
      the nether part, yet not the less a part for which we are bound to
      exercise a specially considerate care, or else we suffer, for we are
      sensitive there: this is justice but the indications by fiddle-faddle
      verbiage of anything objectionable to the whole in the part aroused an
      irritability that speedily endued him with the sense of sanity opposing
      lunacy; when, not having a wide command of the undecorated plain speech
      which enjoyed his approval, he withdrew into the entrenchments of
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick heard enough to let him understand why the lord of Earlsfont and
      Captain Con were not on the best of terms. Once or twice he had a twinge
      or suspicion of a sting from the tone of his host, though he was not
      political and was of a mood to pity the poor gentleman&rsquo;s melancholy state
      of solitariness, with all his children absent, his wife dead, only a
      niece, a young lady of twenty, to lend an air of grace and warmth to his
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a Caroline, and as he had never taken a liking to a Caroline, he
      classed her in the tribe of Carolines. To a Kathleen, an Eveleen, a Nora,
      or a Bessy, or an Alicia, he would have bowed more cordially on his
      introduction to her, for these were names with portraits and vistas
      beyond, that shook leaves of recollection of the happiest of life&mdash;the
      sweet things dreamed undesiringly in opening youth. A Caroline awakened no
      soft association of fancies, no mysterious heaven and earth. The others
      had variously tinted skies above them; their features wooed the dream, led
      it on as the wooded glen leads the eye till we are deep in richness. Nor
      would he have throbbed had one of any of his favourite names appeared in
      the place of Caroline Adister. They had not moved his heart, they had only
      stirred the sources of wonder. An Eveleen had carried him farthest to
      imagine the splendours of an Adiante, and the announcement of the coming
      of an Eveleen would perchance have sped a little wild fire, to which what
      the world calls curiosity is frozenly akin, through his veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Adister had spoken of his niece Caroline. A lacquey, receiving orders
      from his master, mentioned Miss Adister. There was but one Miss Adister
      for Patrick. Against reason, he was raised to anticipate the possible
      beholding of her, and Caroline&rsquo;s entrance into the drawing-room brought
      him to the ground. Disappointment is a poor term for the descent from an
      immoderate height, but the acknowledgment that we have shot up
      irrationally reconciles even unphilosophical youth to the necessity of the
      fall, though we must continue sensible of a shock. She was the Miss
      Adister; and how, and why? No one else accompanied them on their march to
      the dinner-table. Patrick pursued his double task of hunting his thousand
      speculations and conversing fluently, so that it is not astonishing if,
      when he retired to his room, the impression made on him by this young
      Caroline was inefficient to distinguish her from the horde of her
      baptismal sisters. And she had a pleasant face: he was able to see that,
      and some individuality in the look of it, the next morning; and then he
      remembered the niceness of her manners. He supposed her to have been
      educated where the interfusion of a natural liveliness with a veiling
      retenue gives the title of lady. She had enjoyed the advantage of having
      an estimable French lady for her governess, she informed him, as they
      sauntered together on the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A Protestant, of course,&rsquo; Patrick spoke as he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madame Dugue is a Catholic of Catholics, and the most honourable of
      women.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I&rsquo;ll believe; and wasn&rsquo;t for proselytisms,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no: she was faithful to her trust.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Save for the grand example!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That,&rsquo; said Caroline, &lsquo;one could strive to imitate without embracing her
      faith.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s my mind clear as print!&rsquo; Patrick exclaimed. &lsquo;The Faith of my
      fathers! and any pattern you like for my conduct, if it&rsquo;s a good one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline hesitated before she said: &lsquo;You have noticed my Uncle Adister&rsquo;s
      prepossession; I mean, his extreme sensitiveness on that subject.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He blazed on me, and he seemed to end by a sort of approval.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed. &lsquo;He has had cause for great unhappiness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it the colonel, or the captain? Forgive me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her head shook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it she? Is it his daughter? I must ask!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have not heard?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! then, I guessed it,&rsquo; cried Patrick, with a flash of pride in his
      arrowy sagacity. &lsquo;Not a word have I heard, but I thought it out for
      myself; because I love my brother, I fancy. And now, if you&rsquo;ll be so good,
      Miss Caroline, let me beg, it&rsquo;s just the address, or the city, or the
      country&mdash;where she is, can you tell me?&mdash;just whereabouts!
      You&rsquo;re surprised: but I want her address, to be off, to see her; I&rsquo;m
      anxious to speak to her. It&rsquo;s anywhere she may be in a ring, only show me
      the ring, I&rsquo;ll find her, for I&rsquo;ve a load; and there&rsquo;s nothing like that
      for sending you straight, though it&rsquo;s in the dark; it acts like an
      instinct. But you know the clear address, and won&rsquo;t let me be running
      blindfold. She&rsquo;s on the Continent and has been a long time, and it was the
      capital of Austria, which is a Catholic country, and they&rsquo;ve Irish blood
      in the service there, or they had. I could drop on my knees to you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The declaration was fortunately hushed by a supplicating ardour, or Mr.
      Adister would have looked more surprised than his niece. He stepped out of
      the library window as they were passing, and, evidently with a mind
      occupied by his own affairs, held up an opened letter for Caroline&rsquo;s
      perusal. She took a view of the handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any others?&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will consider that one enough for the day,&rsquo; was his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick descended the terrace and strolled by the waterside, grieved at
      their having bad news, and vexed with himself for being a stranger, unable
      to console them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later they were all three riding to the market-town, where
      Mr. Adister paid a fruitless call on his lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And never is at home! never was known to be at home when wanted!&rsquo; he
      said, springing back to the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline murmured some soothing words. They had a perverse effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His partner! yes, his partner is at home, but I do not communicate upon
      personal business with his partner; and by and by there will be, I
      suppose, a third partner. I might as well deposit my family history in the
      hands of a club. His partner is always visible. It is my belief that
      Camminy has taken a partner that he may act the independent gentleman at
      his leisure. I, meantime, must continue to be the mark for these letters.
      I shall expect soon to hear myself abused as the positive cause of the
      loss of a Crown!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Camminy will probably appear at the dinner hour,&rsquo; said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Claret attracts him: I wish I could say as much of duty,&rsquo; rejoined her
      uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick managed to restrain a bubbling remark on the respective charms of
      claret and duty, tempting though the occasion was for him to throw in a
      conversational word or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was rewarded for listening devoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Adister burst out again: &lsquo;And why not come over here to settle this
      transaction herself?&mdash;provided that I am spared the presence of her
      Schinderhannes! She could very well come. I have now received three
      letters bearing on this matter within as many months. Down to the sale of
      her hereditary jewels! I profess no astonishment. The jewels may well go
      too, if Crydney and Welvas are to go. Disrooted body and soul!&mdash;for a
      moonshine title!&mdash;a gaming-table foreign knave!&mdash;Known for a
      knave!&mdash;A young gentlewoman?&mdash;a wild Welsh...!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline put her horse to a canter, and the exclamations ended, leaving
      Patrick to shuffle them together and read the riddle they presented, and
      toss them to the wind, that they might be blown back on him by the powers
      of air in an intelligible form.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. THE PRINCESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dinner, and a little piano-music and a song closed an evening that was not
      dull to Patrick in spite of prolonged silences. The quiet course of things
      within the house appeared to him to have a listening ear for big events
      outside. He dreaded a single step in the wrong direction, and therefore
      forbore to hang on any of his conjectures; for he might perchance be
      unjust to the blessedest heroine on the surface of the earth&mdash;a truly
      awful thought! Yet her name would no longer bear the speaking of it to
      himself. It conjured up a smoky moon under confounding eclipse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who was Schinderhannes?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Adister had said, her Schinderhannes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick merely wished to be informed who the man was, and whether he had a
      title, and was much of a knave: and particularly Patrick would have liked
      to be informed of the fellow&rsquo;s religion. But asking was not easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not possible. And there was a barrel of powder to lay a fiery head
      on, for a pillow!
    </p>
    <p>
      To confess that he had not the courage to inquire was as good as an
      acknowledgment that he knew too much for an innocent questioner. And what
      did he know? His brother Philip&rsquo;s fair angel forbade him to open the door
      upon what he knew. He took a peep through fancy&rsquo;s keyhole, and delighted
      himself to think that he had seen nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a turbulent night with Schinderhannes, who let him go no earlier
      than the opening of a December day, Patrick hied away to one of the dusky
      nooks by the lake for a bracing plunge. He attributed to his desire for it
      the strange deadness of the atmosphere, and his incapacity to get an idea
      out of anything he looked on: he had not a sensation of cold till the
      stinging element gripped him. It is the finest school for the cure of
      dreamers; two minutes of stout watery battle, with the enemy close all
      round, laughing, but not the less inveterate, convinced him that, in
      winter at least, we have only to jump out of our clothes to feel the
      reality of things in a trice. The dip was sharpening; he could say that
      his prescription was good for him; his craving to get an idea ceased with
      it absolutely, and he stood in far better trim to meet his redoubtable
      adversary of overnight; but the rascal was a bandit and had robbed him of
      his purse; that was a positive fact; his vision had gone; he felt himself
      poor and empty and rejoicing in the keenness of his hunger for breakfast,
      singularly lean. A youth despoiled of his Vision and made sensible by the
      activity of his physical state that he is a common machine, is eager for
      meat, for excess of whatsoever you may offer him; he is on the highroad of
      recklessness, and had it been the bottle instead of Caroline&rsquo;s coffee-cup,
      Patrick would soon have received a priming for a delivery of views upon
      the sex, and upon love, and the fools known as lovers, acrid enough to win
      the applause of cynics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boasting was the best relief that a young man not without modesty could
      find. Mr. Adister complimented him on the robustness of his habits, and
      Patrick &lsquo;would like to hear of the temptation that could keep him from his
      morning swim.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline&rsquo;s needle-thrust was provoked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would not Arctic weather deter you, Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell?&rsquo; He hummed, and her
      eyes filled with the sparkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Short of Arctic,&rsquo; he had to say. &lsquo;But a gallop, after an Arctic bath,
      would soon spin the blood-upon an Esquimaux dog, of course,&rsquo; he pursued,
      to anticipate his critic&rsquo;s remark on the absence of horses, with a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, accepting the mental alertness he fastened on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must perforce be critics of these tear-away wits; which are, moreover,
      so threadbare to conceal the character! Caroline led him to vaunt his
      riding and his shooting, and a certain time passed before she perceived
      that though he responded naturally to her first sly attacks, his gross
      exaggerations upon them had not been the triumph of absurdity she supposed
      herself to have evoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her wish was to divert her uncle. Patrick discerned the intention and
      aided her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As for entertainment,&rsquo; he said, in answer to Mr. Adister&rsquo;s courteous
      regrets that he would have to be a prisoner in the house until his legal
      adviser thought proper to appear, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be perfectly happy if Miss
      Caroline will give me as much of her company as she can spare. It &lsquo;s
      amusing to be shot at too, by a lady who &lsquo;s a good marksman! And birds and
      hares are always willing to wait for us; they keep better alive. I forgot
      to say that I can sing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I was in the presence of a connoisseur last night,&rsquo; said Caroline.
      Mr. Adister consulted his watch and the mantelpiece clock for a minute of
      difference between them, remarking that he was a prisoner indeed, and for
      the whole day, unless Camminy should decide to come. &lsquo;There is the
      library,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;if you care for books; the best books on agriculture
      will be found there. You can make your choice in the stables, if you would
      like to explore the country. I am detained here by a man who seems to
      think my business of less importance than his pleasures. And it is not my
      business; it is very much the reverse but I am compelled to undertake it
      as my own, when I abhor the business. It is hard for me to speak of it,
      much more to act a part in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; Caroline interposed hurriedly, &lsquo;Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell would not be
      unwilling to begin the day with some duets?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick eagerly put on his shame-face to accept her invitation, protesting
      that his boldness was entirely due to his delight in music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I&rsquo;ve heard,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that the best fortification for the exercise
      of the a voice is hearty eating, so I &lsquo;ll pay court again to that
      game-pie. I&rsquo;m one with the pigs for truffles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His host thanked him for spreading the contagion of good appetite, and
      followed his example. Robust habits and heartiness were signs with him of
      a conscience at peace, and he thought the Jesuits particularly forbearing
      in the amount of harm they had done to this young man. So they were still
      at table when Mr. Camminy was announced and ushered in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man of law murmured an excuse or two; he knew his client&rsquo;s eye, and
      how to thaw it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Miss Adister, I have not breakfasted,&rsquo; he said, taking the chair
      placed for him. &lsquo;I was all day yesterday at Windlemont, engaged in
      assisting to settle the succession. Where estates are not entailed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The expectations of the family are undisciplined and certain not to be
      satisfied,&rsquo; Mr. Adister carried on the broken sentence. &lsquo;That house will
      fall! However, you have lost no time this morning.&mdash;Mr. Patrick
      O&rsquo;Donnell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Camminy bowed busily somewhere in the direction between Patrick and
      the sideboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our lawyers have us inside out, like our physicians,&rsquo; Mr. Adister
      resumed, talking to blunt his impatience for a private discussion with his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surgery&rsquo;s a little in their practice too, we think in Ireland,&rsquo; said
      Patrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Camminy assented: &lsquo;No doubt.&rsquo; He was hungry, and enjoyed the look of
      the table, but the look of his client chilled the prospect, considered in
      its genial appearance as a feast of stages; having luminous extension; so,
      to ease his client&rsquo;s mind, he ventured to say: &lsquo;I thought it might be
      urgent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is urgent,&rsquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah: foreign? domestic?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A frown replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline, in haste to have her duties over, that she might escape the
      dreaded outburst, pressed another cup of tea on Mr. Camminy and groaned to
      see him fill his plate. She tried to start a topic with Patrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The princess is well, I hope?&rsquo; Mr. Camminy asked in the voice of
      discretion. &lsquo;It concerns her Highness?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It concerns my daughter and her inheritance from her mad grandmother!&rsquo; 
      Mr. Adister rejoined loudly; and he continued like a retreating thunder:
      &lsquo;A princess with a title as empty as a skull! At best a princess of
      swamps, and swine that fight for acorns, and men that fight for swine!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick caught a glance from Caroline, and the pair rose together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They did that in our mountains a couple of thousand years ago,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Camminy, &lsquo;and the cause was not so bad, to judge by this ham. Men must
      fight: the law is only a quieter field for them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a fatter for the ravens,&rsquo; Patrick joined in softly, as if carrying on
      a song.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have at us, Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell! I&rsquo;m ashamed of my appetite, Miss Adister, but
      the morning&rsquo;s drive must be my excuse, and I&rsquo;m bounden to you for not
      forcing me to detain you. Yes, I can finish breakfast at my leisure, and
      talk of business, which is never particularly interesting to ladies&mdash;though,&rsquo; 
      Mr. Camminy turned to her uncle, &lsquo;I know Miss Adister has a head for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick hummed a bar or two of an air, to hint of his being fanatico per
      la musica, as a pretext for their departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you&rsquo;ll deign to give me a lesson,&rsquo; said he, as Caroline came away from
      pressing her lips to her uncle&rsquo;s forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I may discover that I am about to receive one,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      They quitted the room together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Camminy had seen another Miss Adister duetting with a young Irishman
      and an O&rsquo;Donnell, with lamentable results to that union of voices, and he
      permitted himself to be a little astonished at his respected client&rsquo;s
      defective memory or indifference to the admonition of identical
      circumstances.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. AT THE PIANO, CHIEFLY WITHOUT MUSIC
    </h2>
    <p>
      Barely had the door shut behind them when Patrick let his heart out: &lsquo;The
      princess?&rsquo; He had a famished look, and Caroline glided along swiftly with
      her head bent, like one musing; his tone alarmed her; she lent him her
      ear, that she might get some understanding of his excitement, suddenly as
      it seemed to have come on him; but he was all in his hungry interrogation,
      and as she reached her piano and raised the lid, she saw it on tiptoe
      straining for her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought you were aware of my cousin&rsquo;s marriage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was I?&rsquo; said Patrick, asking it of himself, for his conscience would not
      acknowledge an absolute ignorance. &lsquo;No: I fought it, I wouldn&rsquo;t have a
      blot on her be suspected. She&rsquo;s married! She&rsquo;s married to one of their
      princes!&mdash;married for a title!&mdash;and changed her religion! And
      Miss Adister, you&rsquo;re speaking of Adiante?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My cousin Adiante.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well did I hate the name! I heard it first over in France. Our people
      wrote to me of her; and it&rsquo;s a name to set you thinking: Is she tender, or
      nothing like a woman,&mdash;a stone? And I put it to my best friend there,
      Father Clement, who&rsquo;s a scholar, up in everything, and he said it was a
      name with a pretty sound and an ill meaning&mdash;far from tender; and a
      bad history too, for she was one of the forty-nine Danaides who killed
      their husbands for the sake of their father and was not likely to be the
      fiftieth, considering the name she bore. It was for her father&rsquo;s sake she
      as good as killed her lover, and the two Adiantes are like enough: they&rsquo;re
      as like as a pair of hands with daggers. So that was my brother Philip&rsquo;s
      luck! She&rsquo;s married! It&rsquo;s done; it&rsquo;s over, like death: no hope. And this
      time it&rsquo;s against her father; it&rsquo;s against her faith. There&rsquo;s the end of
      Philip! I could have prophesied it; I did; and when they broke, from her
      casting him off&mdash;true to her name! thought I. She cast him off, and
      she couldn&rsquo;t wait for him, and there&rsquo;s his heart broken. And I ready to
      glorify her for a saint! And now she must have loved the man, or his
      title, to change her religion. She gives him her soul! No praise to her
      for that: but mercy! what a love it must be. Or else it&rsquo;s a spell. But
      wasn&rsquo;t she rather one for flinging spells than melting? Except that we&rsquo;re
      all of us hit at last, and generally by our own weapon. But she loved
      Philip: she loved him down to shipwreck and drowning: she gave battle for
      him, and against her father; all the place here and the country&rsquo;s alive
      with their meetings and partings:&mdash;she can&rsquo;t have married! She
      wouldn&rsquo;t change her religion for her lover: how can she have done it for
      this prince? Why, it&rsquo;s to swear false oaths!&mdash;unless it&rsquo;s possible
      for a woman to slip out of herself and be another person after a death
      like that of a love like hers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick stopped: the idea demanded a scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s another person for me,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the worst I ever imagined
      of her!&mdash;thousands of miles and pits of sulphur beyond the worst and
      the very worst! I thought her fickle, I thought her heartless, rather a
      black fairy, perched above us, not quite among the stars of heaven. I had
      my ideas. But never that she was a creature to jump herself down into a
      gulf and be lost for ever. She&rsquo;s gone, extinguished&mdash;there she is,
      under the penitent&rsquo;s hoodcap with eyeholes, before the faggots! and that&rsquo;s
      what she has married!&mdash;a burning torment, and none of the joys of
      martyrdom. Oh! I&rsquo;m not awake. But I never dreamed of such a thing as this&mdash;not
      the hard, bare, lump-of-earth-fact:&mdash;and that&rsquo;s the only thing to
      tell me I&rsquo;m not dreaming now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He subsided again; then deeply beseeching asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you by chance a portrait of the gentleman, Miss Adister? Is there
      one anywhere?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline stood at her piano, turning over the leaves of a music-book, with
      a pressure on her eyelids. She was near upon being thrilled in spite of an
      astonishment almost petrifying: and she could nearly have smiled, so
      strange was his fraternal adoption, amounting to a vivification&mdash;of
      his brother&rsquo;s passion. He seemed quite naturally to impersonate Philip.
      She wondered, too, in the coolness of her alien blood, whether he was a
      character, or merely an Irish character. As to the unwontedness of the
      scene, Ireland was chargeable with that; and Ireland also, a little at his
      expense as a citizen of the polite world, relieved him of the extreme
      ridicule attached to his phrases and images.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied: &lsquo;We have no portrait.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I beg to know, have you seen him?&rsquo; said Patrick. Caroline shook her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there no telling what he is like, Miss Adister?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is not young.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An old man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not said that, and she wished to defend her cousin from the charge
      of contracting such an alliance, but Patrick&rsquo;s face had brightened out of
      a gloom of stupefaction; he assured her he was now ready to try his voice
      with hers, only she was to excuse a touch of hoarseness; he felt it
      slightly in his throat: and could he, she asked him, wonder at it after
      his morning&rsquo;s bath?
    </p>
    <p>
      He vindicated the saneness of the bath as well as he was able, showing
      himself at least a good reader of music. On the whole, he sang pleasantly,
      particularly French songs. She complimented him, with an emphasis on the
      French. He said, yes, he fancied he did best in French, and he had an idea
      of settling in France, if he found that he could not live quietly in his
      own country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And becoming a Frenchman?&rsquo; said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I &lsquo;m more at home with French people; they&rsquo;re mostly
      of my creed; they&rsquo;re amiable, though they weren&rsquo;t quite kind to poor Lally
      Tollendal. I like them. Yes, I love France, and when I&rsquo;m called upon to
      fix myself, as I suppose I shall be some day, I shan&rsquo;t have the bother
      over there that I should find here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke reproachfully: &lsquo;Have you no pride in the title of Englishman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I &lsquo;m an Irishman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are one nation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And it&rsquo;s one family where the dog is pulled by the collar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a retort on him: she saw, as it were, the box, but the lid would
      not open to assist her to it, and she let it go by, thinking in her
      patriotic derision, that to choose to be likened to the unwilling dog of
      the family was evidence of a want of saving pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, she could not trust to the glibness of her tongue in a contest
      with a young gentleman to whom talking was as easy as breathing, even if
      sometimes his volubility exposed him to attack. A superior position was
      offered her by her being silent and critical. She stationed herself on it:
      still she was grieved to think of him as a renegade from his country, and
      she forced herself to say: &lsquo;Captain O&rsquo;Donnell talks in that manner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Captain Con is constitutionally discontented because he&rsquo;s a bard by
      nature, and without the right theme for his harp,&rsquo; said Patrick. &lsquo;He has a
      notion of Erin as the unwilling bride of Mr. Bull, because her lord is not
      off in heroics enough to please her, and neglects her, and won&rsquo;t let her
      be mistress of her own household, and she can&rsquo;t forget that he once had
      the bad trick of beating her: she sees the marks. And you mayn&rsquo;t believe
      it, but the Captain&rsquo;s temper is to praise and exalt. It is. Irony in him
      is only eulogy standing on its head: a sort of an upside down; a
      perversion: that&rsquo;s our view of him at home. All he desires is to have us
      on the march, and he&rsquo;d be perfectly happy marching, never mind the banner,
      though a bit of green in it would put him in tune, of course. The banner
      of the Cid was green, Miss Adister: or else it&rsquo;s his pennon that was. And
      there&rsquo;s a quantity of our blood in Spain too. We&rsquo;ve watered many lands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor young English lady&rsquo;s brain started wildly on the effort to be
      with him, and to understand whether she listened to humour or emotion: she
      reposed herself as well as she could in the contemplation of an
      electrically-flashing maze, where every line ran losing itself in another.
    </p>
    <p>
      He added: &lsquo;Old Philip!&rsquo; in a visible throb of pity for his brother; after
      the scrupulous dubitation between the banner and the pennon of the Cid!
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have comforted her to laugh. She was closer upon tears, and
      without any reason for them in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a position brings the hesitancy which says that the sitting is at an
      end.
    </p>
    <p>
      She feared, as she laid aside her music-books, that there would be more to
      come about Adiante, but he spared her. He bowed to her departing, and
      strolled off by himself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. A CONSULTATION: WITH OPINIONS UPON WELSHWOMEN AND THE CAMBRIAN
      RACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Later in the day she heard that he was out scouring the country on one of
      her uncle&rsquo;s horses. She had too many distressing matters to think of for
      so singular a young man to have any other place than that which is given
      to the fantastical in a troubled and serious mind. He danced there like
      the whimsy sunbeam of a shaken water below. What would be his opinion of
      Adiante if he knew of her determination to sell the two fair estates she
      inherited from a grandmother whom she had venerated; that she might
      furnish arms to her husband to carry out an audacious enterprise likely to
      involve both of them in blood and ruin? Would he not bound up aloft and
      quiver still more wildly? She respected, quaint though it was, his
      imaginative heat of feeling for Adiante sufficiently to associate him with
      her so far; and she lent him in fancy her own bewilderment and grief at
      her cousin&rsquo;s conduct, for the soothing that his exaggeration of them
      afforded her. She could almost hear his outcry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The business of the hour demanded more of her than a seeking for
      refreshment. She had been invited to join the consultation of her uncle
      with his lawyer. Mr. Adister tossed her another letter from Vienna, of
      that morning&rsquo;s delivery. She read it with composure. It became her task to
      pay no heed to his loss of patience, and induce him to acquiesce in his
      legal adviser&rsquo;s view which was, to temporise further, present an array of
      obstacles, and by all possible suggestions induce the princess to come
      over to England, where her father&rsquo;s influence with her would have a chance
      of being established again; and it might then be hoped that she, who had
      never when under sharp temptation acted disobediently to his wishes at
      home, and who certainly would not have dreamed of contracting the abhorred
      alliance had she been breathing the air of common sense peculiar to her
      native land, would see the prudence, if not the solemn obligation, of
      retaining to herself these family possessions. Caroline was urgent with
      her uncle to act on such good counsel. She marvelled at his opposition,
      though she detected the principal basis of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Adister had no ground of opposition but his own intemperateness. The
      Welsh grandmother&rsquo;s legacy of her estates to his girl, overlooking her
      brothers, Colonel Arthur and Captain David, had excessively vexed him,
      despite the strong feeling he entertained for Adiante; and not simply
      because of the blow he received in it unexpectedly from that old lady, as
      the last and heaviest of the long and open feud between them, but also,
      chiefly, that it outraged and did permanent injury to his ideas of the
      proper balance of the sexes. Between himself and Mrs. Winnion Rhys the
      condition of the balance had been a point of vehement disputation, she
      insisting to have it finer up to equality, and he that the naturally
      lighter scale should continue to kick the beam. Behold now the consequence
      of the wilful Welshwoman&rsquo;s insanest of legacies! The estates were left to
      Adiante Adister for her sole use and benefit, making almost a man of her,
      and an unshackled man, owing no dues to posterity. Those estates in the
      hands of a woman are in the hands of her husband; and the husband a
      gambler and a knave, they are in the hands of the Jews&mdash;or gone to
      smoke. Let them go. A devilish malignity bequeathed them: let them go back
      to their infernal origin. And when they were gone, his girl would soon
      discover that there was no better place to come to than her home; she
      would come without an asking, and alone, and without much prospect of the
      intrusion of her infamous Hook-nose in pursuit of her at Earlsfont. The
      money wasted, the wife would be at peace. Here she would have leisure to
      repent of all the steps she had taken since that fatal one of the
      acceptance of the invitation to the Embassy at Vienna. Mr. Adister had
      warned her both against her going and against the influence of her friend
      Lady Wenchester, our Ambassadress there, another Welsh woman, with the
      weathervane head of her race. But the girl would accept, and it was not
      for him to hold out. It appeared to be written that the Welsh,
      particularly Welsh women, were destined to worry him up to the end of his
      days. Their women were a composition of wind and fire. They had no reason,
      nothing solid in their whole nature. Englishmen allied to them had to
      learn that they were dealing with broomstick witches and irresponsible
      sprites. Irishwomen were models of propriety beside them: indeed
      Irishwomen might often be patterns to their English sisterhood. Mr.
      Adister described the Cambrian ladies as a kind of daughters of the Fata
      Morgana, only half human, and deceptive down to treachery, unless you had
      them fast by their spinning fancy. They called it being romantic. It was
      the ante-chamber of madness. Mad, was the word for them. You pleased them
      you knew not how, and just as little did you know how you displeased them.
      And you were long hence to be taught that in a certain past year, and a
      certain month, and on a certain day of the month, not forgetting the hour
      of the day to the minute of the hour, and attendant circumstances to swear
      loud witness to it, you had mortally offended them. And you receive your
      blow: you are sure to get it: the one passion of those women is for
      vengeance. They taste a wound from the lightest touch, and they nurse the
      venom for you. Possibly you may in their presence have had occasion to
      praise the military virtues of the builder of Carnarvon Castle. You are by
      and by pierced for it as hard as they can thrust. Or you have incidentally
      compared Welsh mutton with Southdown:&mdash;you have not highly esteemed
      their drunken Bards:&mdash;you have asked what the Welsh have done in the
      world; you are supposed to have slighted some person of their family&mdash;a
      tenth cousin!&mdash;anything turns their blood. Or you have once looked
      straight at them without speaking, and you discover years after that they
      have chosen to foist on you their idea of your idea at the moment; and
      they have the astounding presumption to account this misreading of your
      look to the extent of a full justification, nothing short of righteous,
      for their treachery and your punishment! O those Welshwomen!
    </p>
    <p>
      The much-suffering lord of Earlsfont stretched forth his open hand, palm
      upward, for a testifying instrument to the plain truth of his catalogue of
      charges. He closed it tight and smote the table. &lsquo;Like mother&mdash;and
      grandmother too&mdash;like daughter!&rsquo; he said, and generalised again to
      preserve his dignity: &lsquo;They&rsquo;re aflame in an instant. You may see them
      quiet for years, but it smoulders. You dropped the spark, and they time
      the explosion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline said to Mr. Camminy: &lsquo;You are sure you can give us the day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All of it,&rsquo; he replied, apologising for some show of restlessness. &lsquo;The
      fact is, Miss Adister, I married a lady from over the borders, and though
      I have never had to complain of her yet, she may have a finale in store.
      It&rsquo;s true that I love wild Wales.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so do I&rsquo; Caroline raised her eyes to imagined mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will pardon me, Camminy,&rsquo; said Mr. Adister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer cracked his back to bow to the great gentleman so magnanimously
      humiliating himself. &lsquo;Sir! Sir!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Yes, Welsh blood is queer
      blood, I own. They find it difficult to forgive; and trifles offend; and
      they are unhappily just as secretive as they are sensitive. The pangs we
      cause them, without our knowing it, must be horrible. They are born, it
      would seem, with more than the common allowance of kibes for treading on:
      a severe misfortune for them. Now for their merits: they have poetry in
      them; they are valiant; they are hospitable to teach the Arab a lesson: I
      do believe their life is their friend&rsquo;s at need&mdash;seriously, they
      would lay it down for him: or the wherewithal, their money, their
      property, excepting the three-stringed harp of three generations back,
      worth now in current value sixpence halfpenny as a curiosity, or three
      farthings for firewood; that they&rsquo;ll keep against their own desire to heap
      on you everything they have&mdash;if they love you, and you at the same
      time have struck their imaginations. Offend them, however, and it&rsquo;s war,
      declared or covert. And I must admit that their best friend can too easily
      offend them. I have lost excellent clients, I have never understood why;
      yet I respect the remains of their literature, I study their language, I
      attend their gatherings and subscribe the expenses; I consume Welsh mutton
      with relish; I enjoy the Triads, and can come down on them with a
      quotation from Catwg the Wise: but it so chanced that I trod on a kibe,
      and I had to pay the penalty. There&rsquo;s an Arabian tale, Miss Adister, of a
      peaceful traveller who ate a date in the desert and flung away the stone,
      which hit an invisible son of a genie in the eye, and the poor traveller
      suffered for it. Well, you commit these mortal injuries to the invisible
      among the Welsh. Some of them are hurt if you call them Welsh. They scout
      it as the original Saxon title for them. No, they are Cymry, Cambrians!
      They have forgiven the Romans. Saxon and Norman are still their enemies.
      If you stir their hearts you find it so. And, by the way, if King Edward
      had not trampled them into the mire so thoroughly, we should hear of it at
      times even now. Instead of penillions and englyns, there would be days for
      fiery triplets. Say the worst of them, they are soundheaded. They have a
      ready comprehension for great thoughts. The Princess Nikolas, I remember,
      had a special fondness for the words of Catwg the Wise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Adiante,&rsquo; had murmured Caroline, to correct his indiscretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nikolas!&rsquo; Mr. Adister thundered. &lsquo;Hold back that name in this house,
      title and all, if you speak of my daughter. I refuse admission to it here.
      She has given up my name, and she must be known by the one her
      feather-brained grandmother proposed for her, to satisfy her pleasure in a
      fine sound. English Christian names are my preference. I conceded Arthur
      to her without difficulty. She had a voice in David, I recollect; with
      very little profit to either of the boys. I had no voice in Adiante; but I
      stood at my girl&rsquo;s baptism, and Adiante let her be. At least I saved the
      girl from the addition of Arianrod. It was to have been Adiante Arianrod.
      Can you credit it? Prince-pah! Nikolas? Have you a notion of the sort of
      prince that makes an English lady of the best blood of England his
      princess?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer had a precise notion of the sort of prince appearing to Mr.
      Adister in the person of his foreign son-in-law. Prince Nikolas had been
      described to him before, with graphic touches upon the quality of the
      reputation he bore at the courts and in the gambling-saloons of Europe.
      Dreading lest his client&rsquo;s angry heat should precipitate him on the prince
      again, to the confusion of a lady&rsquo;s ears, Mr. Camminy gave an emphatic and
      short affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know what he is like?&rsquo; said Mr. Adister, with a face of disgust
      reflected from the bare thought of the hideous likeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Camminy assured him that the description of the prince&rsquo;s lineaments
      would not be new. It was, as he was aware, derived from a miniature of her
      husband, transmitted by the princess, on its flight out of her father&rsquo;s
      loathing hand to the hearthstone and under his heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assisted by Caroline, he managed to check the famous delineation of the
      adventurer prince in which a not very worthy gentleman&rsquo;s chronic fever of
      abomination made him really eloquent, quick to unburden himself in the
      teeth of decorum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And my son-in-law! My son-in-law!&rsquo; ejaculated Mr. Adister, tossing his
      head higher, and so he stimulated his amazement and abhorrence of the
      portrait he rather wondered at them for not desiring to have sketched for
      their execration of it, alluringly foul as it was: while they in concert
      drew him back to the discussion of his daughter&rsquo;s business, reiterating
      prudent counsel, with a knowledge that they had only to wait for the
      ebbing of his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let her be informed, sir, that by coming to England she can settle the
      business according to her wishes in one quarter of the time it would take
      a Commission sent out to her&mdash;if we should be authorised to send out
      one,&rsquo; said Mr. Camminy. &lsquo;By committing the business to you, I fancy I
      perceive your daughter&rsquo;s disposition to consider your feelings: possibly
      to a reluctance to do the deed unsanctioned by her father. It would appear
      so to a cool observer, notwithstanding her inattention to your
      remonstrances.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The reply was: &lsquo;Dine here and sleep here. I shall be having more of these
      letters,&rsquo; Mr. Adister added, profoundly sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline slipped away to mark a conclusion to the debate; and Mr. Camminy
      saw his client redden fast and frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; he spoke in a husky voice, descending upon a subject hateful,
      &lsquo;she tells me to-day she is not in a state to travel! Do you hear? Make
      what you can of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The proud and injured gentleman had the aspect of one who receives a blow
      that it is impossible for him to resent. He could not speak the shame he
      felt: it was literally in his flesh. But the cause had been sufficiently
      hinted to set the lawyer staring as men do when they encounter situations
      of grisly humour, where certain of the passions of man&rsquo;s developed nature
      are seen armed and furious against our mild prevailing ancient mother
      nature; and the contrast is between our utter wrath and her simple
      exposition of the circumstances and consequences forming her laws. There
      are situations which pass beyond the lightly stirred perceptive wits to
      the quiet court of the intellect, to be received there as an addition to
      our acquaintance with mankind. We know not of what substance to name them.
      Humour in its intense strain has a seat somewhere about the mouth of
      tragedy, giving it the enigmatical faint wry pull at a corner visible at
      times upon the dreadful mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Mr. Adister should be astonished at such a communication from the
      princess, after a year of her marriage: and that he should take it for a
      further outrage of his paternal sentiments, should actually redden and be
      hoarse in alluding to it: the revelation of such points in our human
      character set the humane old lawyer staring at the reserve space within
      himself apart from his legal being, whereon he by fits compared his own
      constitution with that of the individuals revealed to him by their acts
      and confidential utterances. For him, he decided that he would have
      rejoiced at the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      Granting the prince a monster, however, as Mr. Adister unforcedly
      considered him, it was not so cheering a piece of intelligence that
      involved him yet closer with that man&rsquo;s rank blood: it curdled his own.
      The marriage had shocked and stricken him, cleaving, in his love for his
      daughter, a goodly tree and withering many flowers. Still the marriage was
      but Adiante&rsquo;s gulf: he might be called father-in-law of her spangled
      ruffian; son-in-law, the desperado-rascal would never be called by him.
      But the result of the marriage dragged him bodily into the gulf: he became
      one of four, numbering the beast twice among them. The subtlety of his
      hatred so reckoned it; for he could not deny his daughter in the father&rsquo;s
      child; he could not exclude its unhallowed father in the mother&rsquo;s: and of
      this man&rsquo;s child he must know and own himself the grandfather. If ever he
      saw the child, if drawn to it to fondle it, some part of the little animal
      not his daughter&rsquo;s would partake of his embrace. And if neither of his
      boys married, and his girl gave birth to a son! darkness rolled upon that
      avenue of vision. A trespasser and usurper-one of the demon&rsquo;s brood chased
      his very name out of Earlsfont!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Camminy, you must try to amuse yourself,&rsquo; he said briskly. &lsquo;Anything you
      may be wanting at home shall be sent for. I must have you here to make
      sure that I am acting under good advice. You can take one of the keepers
      for an hour or two of shooting. I may join you in the afternoon. You will
      find occupation for your gun in the north covers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He wandered about the house, looking into several rooms, and only
      partially at rest when he discovered Caroline in one, engaged upon some of
      her aquarelle sketches. He asked where the young Irishman was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you in search of him?&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;You like him, uncle? He is out
      riding, they tell me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The youngster is used to south-western showers in that climate of his,&rsquo; 
      Mr. Adister replied. &lsquo;I dare say we could find the Jesuit in him
      somewhere. There&rsquo;s the seed. His cousin Con O&rsquo;Donnell has filled him with
      stuff about Ireland and England: the man has no better to do than to train
      a parrot. What do you think of him, my love?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The judgement was not easily formed for expression. &lsquo;He is not quite like
      what I remember of his brother Philip. He talks much more, does he not? He
      seems more Irish than his brother. He is very strange. His feelings are
      strong; he has not an idea of concealing them. For a young man educated by
      the Jesuits, he is remarkably open.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Jesuits might be of service to me just now!&rsquo; Mr. Adister addressed
      his troubled soul, and spoke upon another conception of them: &lsquo;How has he
      shown his feelings?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline answered quickly: &lsquo;His love of his brother. Anything that
      concerns his brother moves him; it is like a touch on a musical
      instrument. Perhaps I should say a native one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Concerns his brother?&rsquo; Mr. Adister inquired, and his look requesting
      enlightenment told her she might speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Adiante,&rsquo; she said softly. She coloured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her uncle mused awhile in a half-somnolent gloom. &lsquo;He talks of this at
      this present day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not dead to him. He really appears to have hoped... he is
      extraordinary. He had not heard before of her marriage. I was a witness of
      the most singular scene this morning, at the piano. He gathered it from
      what he had heard. He was overwhelmed by it. I could not exaggerate. It
      was impossible to help being a little touched, though it was curious, very
      strange.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her uncle&rsquo;s attentiveness incited her to describe the scene, and as it
      visibly relieved his melancholy, she did it with a few vivid indications
      of the quaint young Irishman&rsquo;s manner of speech. She concluded: &lsquo;At last
      he begged to see a portrait of her husband.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not of her?&rsquo; said Mr. Adister abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; only of her husband.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Show him her portrait.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A shade of surprise was on Caroline&rsquo;s forehead. &lsquo;Shall I?&rsquo; She had a dim
      momentary thought that the sight of the beautiful face would not be good
      for Patrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; let him see the woman who could throw herself away on that branded
      villain called a prince, abjuring her Church for a little fouler than
      hangman to me and every gentleman alive. I desire that he should see it.
      Submission to the demands of her husband&rsquo;s policy required it of her, she
      says! Show it him when he returns; you have her miniature in your keeping.
      And to-morrow take him to look at the full-length of her before she left
      England and ceased to be a lady of our country. I will order it to be
      placed in the armoury. Let him see the miniature of her this day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Adister resolved at the same time that Patrick should have his
      portrait of the prince for a set-off to the face of his daughter. He
      craved the relief it would be to him to lay his colours on the prince for
      the sparkling amazement of one whom, according to Caroline&rsquo;s description,
      he could expect to feel with him acutely, which neither his niece nor his
      lawyer had done: they never did when he painted the prince. He was
      unstrung, heavily plunged in the matter of his chagrin and grief: his
      unhealed wound had been scraped and strewn with salt by his daughter&rsquo;s
      letter; he had a thirst for the kind of sympathy he supposed he would find
      in the young Irishman&rsquo;s horror at the husband of the incomparable beauty
      now past redemption degraded by her hideous choice; lost to England and to
      her father and to common respect. For none, having once had the picture of
      the man, could dissociate them; they were like heaven and its reverse,
      everlastingly coupled in the mind by their opposition of characters and
      aspects. Her father could not, and he judged of others by himself. He had
      been all but utterly solitary since her marriage, brooded on it until it
      saturated him; too proud to speak of the thing in sadness, or claim
      condolence for this wound inflicted on him by the daughter he had idolised
      other than through the indirect method of causing people to wonder at her
      chosen yoke-fellow. Their stupefaction refreshed him. Yet he was a
      gentleman capable of apprehending simultaneously that he sinned against
      his pride in the means he adopted to comfort his nature. But the wound was
      a perpetual sickness needing soul-medicine. Proud as he was, and
      unbending, he was not stronger than his malady, and he could disguise, he
      could not contain, the cry of immoderate grief. Adiante had been to him
      something beyond a creature beloved; she had with her glorious beauty and
      great-heartedness been the sole object which had ever inspirited his
      imagination. He could have thought no man, not the most illustrious,
      worthy of her. And there she was, voluntarily in the hands of a monster!
      &lsquo;Husband!&rsquo; Mr. Adister broke away from Caroline, muttering: &lsquo;Her husband&rsquo;s
      policy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was used to his interjections; she sat thinking more of the strange
      request to her to show Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell the miniature of Adiante. She had
      often thought that her uncle regretted his rejection of Philip. It
      appeared so to her now, though not by any consecutive process of
      reasoning. She went to fetch the miniature, and gazing on it, she tried to
      guess at Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s thoughts when doing the same; for who so
      inflammable as he? And who, woman or man, could behold this lighted face,
      with the dark raised eyes and abounding auburn tresses, where the contrast
      of colours was in itself thrilling, and not admire, or more, half worship,
      or wholly worship? She pitied the youth: she fancied that he would not
      continue so ingenuously true to his brother&rsquo;s love of Adiante after seeing
      it; unless one might hope that the light above beauty distinguishing its
      noble classic lines, and the energy of radiance, like a morning of
      chivalrous promise, in the eyes, would subdue him to distant admiration.
      These were her flitting thoughts under the spell of her queenly cousin&rsquo;s
      visage. She shut up the miniature-case, and waited to hand it to young Mr.
      O&rsquo;Donnell.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. THE MINIATURE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Patrick returned to Earlsfont very late; he had but ten minutes to dress
      for dinner; a short allowance after a heated ride across miry tracks,
      though he would have expended some of them, in spite of his punctilious
      respect for the bell of the house entertaining him, if Miss Adister had
      been anywhere on the stairs or corridors as he rushed away to his room. He
      had things to tell; he had not been out over the country for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for his good social principles, the butler at Earlsfont was a
      wary supervisor of his man; great guest or little guest; Patrick&rsquo;s linen
      was prepared for him properly studded; he had only to spring out of one
      suit into another; and still more fortunately the urgency for a rapid
      execution of the manoeuvre prevented his noticing a large square envelope
      posted against the looking-glass of his toilette-table. He caught sight of
      it first when pulling down his shirt-cuffs with an air of recovered ease,
      not to say genial triumph, to think that the feat of grooming himself,
      washing, dressing and stripping, the accustomed persuasive final sweep of
      the brush to his hair-crop, was done before the bell had rung. His name
      was on the envelope; and under his name, in smaller letters,
    </p>
    <p>
      Adiante.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I?&rsquo; said he, doing the thing he asked himself about doing tearing
      open the paper cover of the portrait of her who had flitted in his head
      for years unseen. And there she was, remote but present.
    </p>
    <p>
      His underlip dropped; he had the look of those who bate breath and swarm
      their wits to catch a sound. At last he remembered that the summoning bell
      had been in his ears a long time back, without his having been sensible of
      any meaning in it. He started to and fro. The treasure he held declined to
      enter the breast-pocket of his coat, and the other pockets he perhaps, if
      sentimentally, justly discarded as being beneath the honour of serving for
      a temporary casket. He locked it up, with a vow to come early to rest.
      Even then he had thoughts whether it might be safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who spoke, and what they uttered at the repast, and his own remarks, he
      was unaware of. He turned right and left a brilliant countenance that had
      the glitter of frost-light; it sparkled and was unreceptive. No wonder
      Miss Adister deemed him wilder and stranger than ever. She necessarily
      supposed the excess of his peculiarities to be an effect of the portrait,
      and would have had him, according to her ideas of a young man of some
      depth of feeling, dreamier. On the contrary, he talked sheer commonplace.
      He had ridden to the spur of the mountains, and had put up the mare, and
      groomed and fed her, not permitting another hand to touch her: all very
      well, and his praises of the mare likewise, but he had not a syllable for
      the sublime of the mountains. He might have careered over midland flats
      for any susceptibility that he betrayed to the grandeur of the scenery she
      loved. Ultimately she fancied the miniature had been overlooked in his
      hurry to dress, and that he was now merely excited by his lively gallop to
      a certain degree of hard brightness noticeable in hunting men at their
      dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elixir in Patrick carried him higher than mountain crests. Adiante
      illumined an expanded world for him, miraculous, yet the real one, only
      wanting such light to show its riches. She lifted it out of darkness with
      swift throbs of her heavenliness as she swam to his eyelids, vanished and
      dazzled anew, and made these gleams of her and the dark intervals his
      dream of the winged earth on her flight from splendour to splendour,
      secresy to secresy;&mdash;follow you that can, the youth whose heart is an
      opened mine, whose head is an irradiated sky, under the spell of imagined
      magical beauty. She was bugle, banner, sunrise, of his inmost ambition and
      rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      And without a warning, she fled; her features were lost; his power of
      imagining them wrestled with vapour; the effort contracted his outlook.
      But if she left him blind of her, she left him with no lessened bigness of
      heart. He frankly believed in her revelation of a greater world and a
      livelier earth, a flying earth and a world wealthier than grouped history
      in heroic marvels: he fell back on the exultation of his having seen her,
      and on the hope for the speedy coming of midnight, when the fountain of
      her in the miniature would be seen and drunk of at his full leisure, and
      his glorious elation of thrice man almost up to mounting spirit would be
      restored to make him worthy of the vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Caroline had withdrawn and the lord of Earlsfont was fretting at
      his theme. He had decided not to be a party in the sale of either of his
      daughter&rsquo;s estates: let her choose other agents: if the iniquity was
      committed, his hands would be clean of it. Mr. Adister spoke by way of
      prelude to the sketch of &lsquo;this prince&rsquo; whose title was a lurid delusion.
      Patrick heard of a sexagenarian rake and Danube adventurer, in person a
      description of falcon-Caliban, containing his shagginess in a frogged
      hussar-jacket and crimson pantaloons, with hook-nose, fox-eyes, grizzled
      billow of frowsy moustache, and chin of a beast of prey. This fellow,
      habitually one of the dogs lining the green tables of the foreign Baths,
      snapping for gold all day and half the night, to spend their winnings in
      debauchery and howl threats of suicide, never fulfilled early enough, when
      they lost, claimed his princedom on the strength of his father&rsquo;s murder of
      a reigning prince and sitting in his place for six months, till a merited
      shot from another pretender sent him to his account. &lsquo;What do you say to
      such a nest of assassins, and one of them, an outcast and blackleg, asking
      an English gentleman to acknowledge him as a member of his family! I
      have,&rsquo; said Mr. Adister, &lsquo;direct information that this gibbet-bird is
      conspiring to dethrone&mdash;they call it&mdash;the present reigning
      prince, and the proceeds of my daughter&rsquo;s estates are, by her desire&mdash;if
      she has not written under compulsion of the scoundrel&mdash;intended to
      speed their blood-mongering. There goes a Welshwoman&rsquo;s legacy to the sea,
      with a herd of swine with devils in them!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Camminy kept his head bent, his hand on his glass of port. Patrick
      stared, and the working of his troubled brows gave the unhappy gentleman
      such lean comfort as he was capable of taking. Patrick in sooth was
      engaged in the hard attempt at the same time to do two of the most
      difficult things which can be proposed to the ingenuity of sensational
      youth: he was trying to excuse a respected senior for conduct that he
      could not approve, while he did inward battle to reconcile his feelings
      with the frightful addition to his hoard of knowledge: in other words, he
      sought strenuously to mix the sketch of the prince with the dregs of the
      elixir coming from the portrait of Adiante; and now she sank into
      obscurity behind the blackest of brushes, representing her incredible
      husband; and now by force of some natural light she broke through the ugly
      mist and gave her adored the sweet lines and colours of the features he
      had lost. There was an ebb and flow of the struggle, until, able to say to
      himself that he saw her clearly as though the portrait was in the palm of
      his hand, the battle of the imagination ceased and she was fairer for him
      than if her foot had continued pure of its erratic step: fairer, owing to
      the eyes he saw with; he had shaken himself free of the exacting senses
      which consent to the worship of women upon the condition of their
      possessing all the precious and the miraculous qualities; among others,
      the gift of an exquisite fragility that cannot break; in short, upon terms
      flattering to the individual devotee. Without knowing it he had done it
      and got some of the upholding strength of those noblest of honest men who
      not merely give souls to women&mdash;an extraordinary endowment of them&mdash;but
      also discourse to them with their souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick accepted Adiante&rsquo;s husband: the man was her husband. Hideous (for
      there was no combating her father&rsquo;s painting of him), he was almost
      interesting through his alliance:&mdash;an example of how much earth the
      worshipper can swallow when he is quite sincere. Instead of his going
      under eclipse, the beauty of his lady eclipsed her monster. He believed in
      her right to choose according to her pleasure since her lover was denied
      her. Sitting alone by his fire, he gazed at her for hours and bled for
      Philip. There was a riddle to be answered in her cutting herself away from
      Philip; he could not answer it; her face was the vindication and the
      grief. The usual traverses besetting true lovers were suggested to him,
      enemies and slanders and intercepted letters. He rejected them in the
      presence of the beautiful inscrutable. Small marvel that Philip had loved
      her. &lsquo;Poor fellow&rsquo; Patrick cried aloud, and drooped on a fit of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sleep he had was urgently dream-ridden to goals that eluded him and
      broadened to fresh races and chases waving something to be won which never
      was won, albeit untiringly pursued amid a series of adventures, tragic
      episodes; wild enthusiasm. The whole of it was featureless, a shifting
      agitation; yet he must have been endowed to extricate a particular meaning
      applied to himself out of the mass of tumbled events, and closely in
      relation to realities, for he quitted his bed passionately regretting that
      he had not gone through a course of drill and study of the military art.
      He remembered Mr. Adister&rsquo;s having said that military training was good
      for all gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could join the French Foreign Legion,&rsquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adiante was as beautiful by day as by night. He looked. The riddle of her
      was more burdensome in the daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed, and on another surging of his admiration launched the resolve
      that he would serve her blindly, without one question. How, when, where,
      and the means and the aim, he did not think of. There was she, and here
      was he, and heaven and a great heart would show the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adiante at eighteen, the full length of her, fresh in her love of Philip,
      was not the same person to him, she had not the same secret; she was
      beautiful differently. By right he should have loved the portrait best:
      but he had not seen it first; he had already lived through a life of
      emotions with the miniature, and could besides clasp the frame; and
      moreover he fondled an absurd notion that the miniature would be entrusted
      to him for a time, and was almost a possession. The pain of the thought of
      relinquishing it was the origin of this foolishness. And again, if it be
      fair to prove him so deeply, true to his brother though he was (admiration
      of a woman does thus influence the tides of our blood to render the
      noblest of us guilty of some unconscious wavering of our loyalty), Patrick
      dedicated the full-length of Adiante to Philip, and reserved the other,
      her face and neck, for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obediently to Mr. Adister&rsquo;s order, the portrait had been taken from one of
      his private rooms and placed in the armoury, the veil covering the canvas
      of late removed. Guns and spears and swords overhead and about, the
      youthful figure of Adiante was ominously encompassed. Caroline stood with
      Patrick before the portrait of her cousin; she expected him to show a sign
      of appreciation. He asked her to tell him the Church whose forms of faith
      the princess had embraced. She answered that it was the Greek Church. &lsquo;The
      Greek,&rsquo; said he, gazing harder at the portrait. Presently she said: &lsquo;It
      was a perfect likeness.&rsquo; She named the famous artist who had painted it.
      Patrick&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ah&rsquo; was unsatisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;think it a living image of her as she was then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He would not be instigated to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do not admire it, Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell?&rsquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, but I do. That&rsquo;s how she looked when she was drawing on her gloves
      with good will to go out to meet him. You can&rsquo;t see her there and not be
      sure she had a heart. She part smiles; she keeps her mouth shut, but
      there&rsquo;s the dimple, and it means a thought, like a bubble bursting up from
      the heart in her breast. She&rsquo;s tall. She carries herself like a great
      French lady, and nothing beats that. It&rsquo;s the same colour, dark eyebrows
      and fair hair. And not thinking of her pride. She thinks of her walk, and
      the end of it, where he&rsquo;s waiting. The eyes are not the same.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The same?&rsquo; said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As this.&rsquo; He tapped on the left side. She did not understand it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The bit of work done in Vienna,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She blushed. &lsquo;Do you admire that so much?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We consider it not to be compared to this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps not. I like it better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why do you like that better?&rsquo; said Caroline, deeming it his
      wilfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick put out a finger. &lsquo;The eyes there don&rsquo;t seem to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m yours to
      make a hero of you.&rdquo; But look,&rsquo; he drew forth from under his waistcoat the
      miniature, &lsquo;what don&rsquo;t they say here! It&rsquo;s a bright day for the Austrian
      capital that has her by the river Danube. Yours has a landscape; I&rsquo;ve made
      acquaintance with the country, I caught the print of it on my ride
      yesterday; and those are your mountains. But mine has her all to herself
      while she&rsquo;s thinking undisturbed in her boudoir. I have her and her
      thoughts; that&rsquo;s next to her soul. I&rsquo;ve an idea it ought to be given to
      Philip.&rsquo; He craned his head round to woo some shadow of assent to the
      daring suggestion. &lsquo;Just to break the shock &lsquo;twill be to my brother, Miss
      Adister. If I could hand him this, and say, &ldquo;Keep it, for you&rsquo;ll get
      nothing more of her; and that&rsquo;s worth a kingdom.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline faltered: &lsquo;Your brother does not know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pity him. His blow &lsquo;s to come. He can&rsquo;t or he &lsquo;d have spoken of it to me.
      I was with him a couple of hours and he never mentioned a word of it, nor
      did Captain Con. We talked of Ireland, and the service, and some French
      cousins we have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ladies?&rsquo; Caroline inquired by instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And charming,&rsquo; said Patrick, &lsquo;real dear girls. Philip might have one, if
      he would, and half my property, to make it right with her parents. There&rsquo;d
      be little use in proposing it. He was dead struck when the shaft struck
      him. That&rsquo;s love! So I determined the night after I&rsquo;d shaken his hand I&rsquo;d
      be off to Earlsfont and try my hardest for him. It&rsquo;s hopeless now. Only he
      might have the miniature for his bride. I can tell him a trifle to help
      him over his agony. She would have had him, she would, Miss Adister, if
      she hadn&rsquo;t feared he&rsquo;d be talked of as Captain Con has been&mdash;about
      the neighbourhood, I mean, because he,&rsquo; Patrick added hurriedly, &lsquo;he
      married an heiress and sank his ambition for distinction like a man who
      has finished his dinner. I&rsquo;m certain she would. I have it on authority.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What authority?&rsquo; said Caroline coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her own old nurse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jenny Williams?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The one! I had it from her. And how she loves her darling Miss Adiante!
      She won&rsquo;t hear of &ldquo;princess.&rdquo; She hates that marriage. She was all for my
      brother Philip. She calls him &ldquo;Our handsome lieutenant.&rdquo; She&rsquo;ll keep the
      poor fellow a subaltern all his life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You went to Jenny&rsquo;s inn?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Earlsfont Arms, I went to. And Mrs. Jenny at the door, watching the
      rain. Destiny directed me. She caught the likeness to Philip on a lift of
      her eye, and very soon we sat conversing like old friends. We were soon
      playing at old cronies over past times. I saw the way to bring her out, so
      I set to work, and she was up in defence of her darling, ready to tell me
      anything to get me to think well of her. And that was the main reason, she
      said, why Miss Adiante broke with him and went abroad her dear child
      wouldn&rsquo;t have Mr. Philip abused for fortune-hunting. As for the religion,
      they could each have practised their own: her father would have consented
      to the fact, when it came on him in that undeniable shape of two made one.
      She says, Miss Adiante has a mighty soul; she has brave ideas. Miss
      Deenly, she calls her. Ay, and so has Philip: though the worst is, they&rsquo;re
      likely to drive him out of the army into politics and Parliament; and an
      Irishman there is a barrow trolling a load of grievances. Ah, but she
      would have kept him straight. Not a soldier alive knows the use of cavalry
      better than my brother. He wanted just that English wife to steady him and
      pour drops of universal fire into him; to keep him face to face with the
      world, I mean; letting him be true to his country in a fair degree, but
      not an old rainpipe and spout. She would have held him to his profession.
      And, Oh dear! She&rsquo;s a friend worth having, lost to Ireland. I see what she
      could have done there. Something bigger than an island, too, has to be
      served in our days: that is, if we don&rsquo;t forget our duty at home. Poor
      Paddy, and his pig, and his bit of earth! If you knew what we feel for
      him! I&rsquo;m a landlord, but I&rsquo;m one with my people about evictions. We Irish
      take strong root. And honest rent paid over to absentees, through an
      agent, if you think of it, seems like flinging the money that&rsquo;s the sweat
      of the brow into a stone conduit to roll away to a giant maw hungry as the
      sea. It&rsquo;s the bleeding to death of our land! Transactions from hand to
      hand of warm human flesh-nothing else will do: I mean, for men of our
      blood. Ah! she would have kept my brother temperate in his notions and his
      plans. And why absentees, Miss Adister? Because we&rsquo;ve no centre of home
      life: the core has been taken out of us; our country has no hearth-fire.
      I&rsquo;m for union; only there should be justice, and a little knowledge to
      make allowance for the natural cravings of a different kind of people.
      Well, then, and I suppose that inter-marriages are good for both. But here
      comes a man, the boldest and handsomest of his race, and he offers himself
      to the handsomest and sweetest of yours, and she leans to him, and the
      family won&rsquo;t have him. For he&rsquo;s an Irishman and a Catholic. Who is it then
      opposed the proper union of the two islands? Not Philip. He did his best;
      and if he does worse now he&rsquo;s not entirely to blame. The misfortune is,
      that when he learns the total loss of her on that rock-promontory, he&rsquo;ll
      be dashing himself upon rocks sure to shiver him. There&rsquo;s my fear. If I
      might take him this...?&rsquo; Patrick pleaded with the miniature raised like
      the figure of his interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caroline&rsquo;s inward smile threw a soft light of humour over her features at
      the simple cunning of his wind-up to the lecture on his country&rsquo;s case,
      which led her to perceive a similar cunning simplicity in his
      identification of it with Philip&rsquo;s. It startled her to surprise, for the
      reason that she&rsquo;d been reviewing his freakish hops from Philip to Ireland
      and to Adiante, and wondering in a different kind of surprise, how and by
      what profitless ingenuity he contrived to weave them together. Nor was she
      unmoved, notwithstanding her fancied perception of his Jesuitry: his look
      and his voice were persuasive; his love of his brother was deep; his
      change of sentiment toward Adiante after the tale told him by her old
      nurse Jenny, stood for proof of a generous manliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she had replied, her uncle entered the armoury, and Patrick was
      pleading still, and she felt herself to be a piece of damask, a very fiery
      dye.
    </p>
    <p>
      To disentangle herself, she said on an impulse, desperately
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell begs to have the miniature for his brother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick swung instantly to Mr. Adister. &lsquo;I presumed to ask for it, sir, to
      carry it to Philip. He is ignorant about the princess as yet; he would
      like to have a bit of the wreck. I shan&rsquo;t be a pleasant messenger to him.
      I should be glad to take him something. It could be returned after a time.
      She was a great deal to Philip&mdash;three parts of his life. He has
      nothing of her to call his own.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That!&rsquo; said Mr. Adister. He turned to the virgin Adiante, sat down and
      shut his eyes, fetching a breath. He looked vacantly at Patrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When you find a man purely destructive, you think him a devil, don&rsquo;t
      you?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A good first cousin to one,&rsquo; Patrick replied, watchful for a hint to
      seize the connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you think of hunting to-day, we have not many minutes to spare before
      we mount. The meet is at eleven, five miles distant. Go and choose your
      horse. Caroline will drive there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick consulted her on a glance for counsel. &lsquo;I shall be glad to join
      you, sir, for to-morrow I must be off to my brother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take it,&rsquo; Mr. Adister waved his hand hastily. He gazed at his idol of
      untouched eighteen. &lsquo;Keep it safe,&rsquo; he said, discarding the sight of the
      princess. &lsquo;Old houses are doomed to burnings, and a devil in the family
      may bring us to ashes. And some day...!&rsquo; he could not continue his thought
      upon what he might be destined to wish for, and ran it on to, &lsquo;Some day I
      shall be happy to welcome your brother, when it pleases him to visit me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick bowed, oppressed by the mighty gift. &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t the word to thank
      you with, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Adister did not wait for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I owe this to you, Miss Adister,&rsquo; said Patrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice shook: &lsquo;My uncle loves those who loved her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He could see she was trembling. When he was alone his ardour of
      gratefulness enabled him to see into her uncle&rsquo;s breast: the inflexible
      frigidity; lasting regrets and remorse; the compassion for Philip in
      kinship of grief and loss; the angry dignity; the stately generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw too, for he was clear-eyed when his feelings were not over-active,
      the narrow pedestal whereon the stiff figure of a man of iron pride must
      accommodate itself to stand in despite of tempests without and within; and
      how the statue rocks there, how much more pitiably than the common sons of
      earth who have the broad common field to fall down on and our good
      mother&rsquo;s milk to set them on their legs again.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. CAPTAIN CON AND MRS. ADISTER O&rsquo;DONNELL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Riding homeward from the hunt at the leisurely trot of men who have
      steamed their mounts pretty well, Mr. Adister questioned Patrick
      familiarly about his family, and his estate, and his brother&rsquo;s prospects
      in the army, and whither he intended first to direct his travels:
      questions which Patrick understood to be kindly put for the sake of
      promoting conversation with a companion of unripe age by a gentleman who
      had wholesomely excited his blood to run. They were answered, except the
      last one. Patrick had no immediate destination in view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave Europe behind you,&rsquo; said Mr. Adister warming, to advise him, and
      checking the trot of his horse. &lsquo;Try South America.&rsquo; The lordly gentleman
      plotted out a scheme of colonisation and conquest in that region with the
      coolness of a practised freebooter. &lsquo;No young man is worth a job,&rsquo; he
      said, &lsquo;who does not mean to be a leader, and as leader to have dominion.
      Here we are fettered by ancestry and antecedents. Had I to recommence
      without those encumbrances, I would try my fortune yonder. I stood
      condemned to waste my youth in idle parades, and hunting the bear and
      buffalo. The estate you have inherited is not binding on you. You can
      realise it, and begin by taking over two or three hundred picked Irish and
      English&mdash;have both races capable of handling spade and musket;
      purchasing some thousands of acres to establish a legal footing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You increase your colony from the mother country in the ratio of your
      prosperity, until your power is respected, and there is a necessity for
      the extension of your territory. When you are feared you will be on your
      mettle. They will favour you with provocation. I should not doubt the
      result, supposing myself to have under my sole command a trained body of
      men of English blood&mdash;and Irish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Owners of the soil,&rsquo; rejoined Patrick, much marvelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Undoubtedly, owners of the soil, but owing you service.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They fight sir&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is hardly to be specified in the calculation, knowing them. Soldiery
      who have served their term, particularly old artillerymen, would be my
      choice: young fellows and boys among them. Women would have to be taken.
      Half-breeds are the ruin of colonists. Our men are born for conquest. We
      were conquerors here, and it is want of action and going physically
      forward that makes us a rusty people. There are&mdash;Mr. Adister&rsquo;s
      intonation told of his proposing a wretched alternative,&mdash;&lsquo;the
      Pacific Islands, but they will soon be snapped up by the European and
      North American Governments, and a single one of them does not offer space.
      It would require money and a navy.&rsquo; He mused. &lsquo;South America is the
      quarter I should decide for, as a young man. You are a judge of horses;
      you ride well; you would have splendid pastures over there; you might
      raise a famous breed. The air is fine; it would suit our English stock. We
      are on ground, Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell, which my forefathers contested sharply and
      did not yield.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The owners of the soil had to do that,&rsquo; said Patrick. &lsquo;I can show the
      same in my country, with a difference.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Considerably to your benefit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everything has been crushed there barring the contrary opinion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could expect such a remark from a rebel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m only interpreting the people, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jump out of that tinder-box as soon as you can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I was in South America, it astonished me that no Englishman had cast
      an eye on so inviting a land. Australia is not comparable with it. And
      where colonisations have begun without system, and without hard fighting
      to teach the settlers to value good leadership and respect their chiefs,
      they tumble into Republics.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick would have liked to fling a word in about the Englishman&rsquo;s cast of
      his eye upon inviting lands, but the trot was resumed, the lord of
      Earlsfont having delivered his mind, and a minute made it happily too late
      for the sarcastic bolt. Glad that his tongue had been kept from wagging,
      he trotted along beside his host in the dusky evening over the once
      contested land where the gentleman&rsquo;s forefathers had done their deeds and
      firmly fixed their descendants. A remainder of dull red fire prolonged the
      half-day above the mountain strongholds of the former owners of the soil,
      upon which prince and bard and priest, and grappling natives never wanting
      for fierceness, roared to-arms in the beacon-flames from ridge to peak:
      and down they poured, and back they were pushed by the inveterate
      coloniser&mdash;stationing at threatened points his old &lsquo;artillerymen&rsquo; of
      those days and so it ends, that bard and priest and prince; holy poetry,
      and divine prescription, and a righteous holding; are as naught against
      him. They go, like yonder embers of the winter sunset before advancing
      night: and to morrow the beacon-heaps are ashes, the conqueror&rsquo;s foot
      stamps on them, the wind scatters them; strangest of all, you hear
      victorious lawlessness appealing solemnly to God the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick was too young to philosophise upon his ideas; or else the series
      of pictures projected by the troops of sensations running through him were
      not of a solidity to support any structure of philosophy. He reverted,
      though rather in name than in spirit, to the abstractions, justice,
      consistency, right. They were too hard to think of, so he abandoned the
      puzzle of fitting them to men&rsquo;s acts and their consciences, and he put
      them aside as mere titles employed for the uses of a police and a tribunal
      to lend an appearance of legitimacy to the decrees of them that have got
      the upper hand. An insurrectionary rising of his breast on behalf of his
      country was the consequence. He kept it down by turning the whole hubbub
      within him to the practical contemplation of a visionary South America as
      the region for him and a fighting tenantry. With a woman, to crown her
      queen there, the prospect was fair. But where dwelt the woman possessing
      majesty suitable to such a dream in her heart or her head? The best he had
      known in Ireland and in France, preferred the charms of society to bold
      adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the same, thought he, it&rsquo;s queer counsel, that we should set to work
      by buying a bit of land to win a clean footing to rob our neighbours: and
      his brains took another shot at Mr. Adister, this time without
      penetrating. He could very well have seen the matter he disliked in a man
      that he disliked; but the father of Adiante had touched him with the gift
      of the miniature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick was not asked to postpone his departure from Earlsfont, nor was he
      invited to come again. Mr. Adister drove him to the station in the early
      morning, and gave him a single nod from the phaeton-box for a good-bye.
      Had not Caroline assured him at the leave-taking between them that he had
      done her uncle great good by his visit, the blank of the usual ceremonial
      phrases would have caused him to fancy himself an intruder courteously
      dismissed, never more to enter the grand old Hall. He was further
      comforted by hearing the stationmaster&rsquo;s exclamation of astonishment and
      pleasure at the sight of the squire &lsquo;in his place&rsquo; handling the reins,
      which had not been witnessed for many a day and so it appeared that the
      recent guest had been exceptionally complimented. &lsquo;But why not a warm
      word, instead of turning me off to decipher a bit of Egyptian on baked
      brick,&rsquo; he thought, incurably Celtic as he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment when he beheld Mr. Adister&rsquo;s phaeton mounting a hill that
      took the first leap for the Cambrian highlands, up to his arrival in
      London, scarcely one of his &lsquo;ideas&rsquo; darted out before Patrick, as they
      were in the habit of doing, like the enchanted bares of fairyland,
      tempting him to pursue, and changing into the form of woman ever, at some
      turn of the chase. For as he had travelled down to Earlsfont in the state
      of ignorance and hopefulness, bearing the liquid brains of that young
      condition, so did his acquisition of a particular fact destructive of hope
      solidify them about it as he travelled back: in other words, they were
      digesting what they had taken in. Imagination would not have stirred for a
      thousand fleeting hares: and principally, it may be, because he was
      conscious that no form of woman would anywhere come of them. Woman was
      married; she had the ring on her finger! He could at his option look on
      her in the miniature, he could think of her as being in the city where she
      had been painted; but he could not conjure her out of space; she was
      nowhere in the ambient air. Secretly she was a feeling that lay half
      slumbering very deep down within him, and he kept the secret, choosing to
      be poor rather than call her forth. He was in truth digesting with
      difficulty, as must be the case when it is allotted to the brains to
      absorb what the soul abhors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor old Philip!&rsquo; was his perpetual refrain. &lsquo;Philip, the girl you loved
      is married; and here&rsquo;s her portrait taken in her last blush; and the man
      who has her hasn&rsquo;t a share in that!&rsquo; Thus, throwing in the ghost of a sigh
      for sympathy, it seemed to Patrick that the intelligence would have to be
      communicated. Bang is better, thought he, for bad news than snapping fire
      and feinting, when you&rsquo;re bound half to kill a fellow, and a manly fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Determined that bang it should be, he hurried from the terminus to
      Philip&rsquo;s hotel, where he had left him, and was thence despatched to the
      house of Captain Con O&rsquo;Donnell, where he created a joyful confusion,
      slightly dashed with rigour on the part of the regnant lady; which is not
      to be wondered at, considering that both the gentlemen attending her,
      Philip and her husband, quitted her table with shouts at the announcement
      of his name, and her husband hauled him in unwashed before her, crying
      that the lost was found, the errant returned, the Prodigal Pat recovered
      by his kinsman! and she had to submit to the introduction of the
      disturber: and a bedchamber had to be thought of for the unexpected guest,
      and the dinner to be delayed in middle course, and her husband corrected
      between the discussions concerning the bedchamber, and either the guest
      permitted to appear at her table in sooty day-garb, or else a great gap
      commanded in the service of her dishes, vexatious extreme for a lady
      composed of orderliness. She acknowledged Patrick&rsquo;s profound salute and
      his excuses with just so many degrees in the inclining of her head as the
      polite deem a duty to themselves when the ruffling world has disarranged
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Con!&rsquo; she called to her chattering husband, &lsquo;we are in England, if you
      please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure, madam,&rsquo; said the captain, &lsquo;and so &lsquo;s Patrick, thanks to the
      stars. We fancied him gone, kidnapped, burned, made a meal of and
      swallowed up, under the earth or the water; for he forgot to give us his
      address in town; he stood before us for an hour or so, and then the fellow
      vanished. We&rsquo;ve waited for him gaping. With your permission I&rsquo;ll venture
      an opinion that he&rsquo;ll go and dabble his hands and sit with us as he is,
      for the once, as it happens.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let it be so,&rsquo; she rejoined, not pacified beneath her dignity. She named
      the bedchamber to a footman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I&rsquo;ll accompany the boy to hurry him on,&rsquo; said the captain, hurrying
      Patrick on as he spoke, till he had him out of the dining-room, when he
      whispered: &lsquo;Out with your key, and if we can scramble you into your
      evening-suit quick we shall heal the breach in the dinner. You dip your
      hands and face, I&rsquo;ll have out the dress. You&rsquo;ve the right style for her,
      my boy: and mind, she is an excellent good woman, worthy of all respect:
      but formality&rsquo;s the flattery she likes: a good bow and short speech. Here
      we are, and the room&rsquo;s lighted. Off to the basin, give me the key; and
      here&rsquo;s hot water in tripping Mary&rsquo;s hands. The portmanteau opens easy.
      Quick! the door&rsquo;s shut on rosy Mary. The race is for domestic peace, my
      boy. I sacrifice everything I can for it, in decency. &lsquo;Tis the secret of
      my happiness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick&rsquo;s transformation was rapid enough to satisfy the impatient
      captain, who said: &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll tell her you couldn&rsquo;t sit down in her presence
      undressed. I married her at forty, you know, when a woman has reached her
      perfect development, and leans a trifle more to ceremonies than to
      substance. And where have you been the while?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you by and by,&rsquo; said Patrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me now, and don&rsquo;t be smirking at the glass; your necktie&rsquo;s as neat
      as a lady&rsquo;s company-smile, equal at both ends, and warranted not to relax
      before the evening &lsquo;s over. And mind you don&rsquo;t set me off talking
      over-much downstairs. I talk in her presence like the usher of the Court
      to the judge. &lsquo;Tis the secret of my happiness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are those rascally dress-boots of mine?&rsquo; cried Patrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Con pitched the contents of the portmanteau right and left. &lsquo;Never
      mind the boots, my boy. Your legs will be under the table during dinner,
      and we&rsquo;ll institute a rummage up here between that and the procession to
      the drawing-room, where you&rsquo;ll be examined head to foot, devil a doubt of
      it. But say, where have you been? She&rsquo;ll be asking, and we&rsquo;re in a mess
      already, and may as well have a place to name to her, somewhere, to excuse
      the gash you&rsquo;ve made in her dinner. Here they are, both of &lsquo;m, rolled in a
      dirty shirt!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick seized the boots and tugged them on, saying &lsquo;Earlsfont, then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been visiting Earlsfont? Whack! but that&rsquo;s the saving of us! Talk
      to her of her brother he sends her his love. Talk to her of the ancestral
      hall&mdash;it stands as it was on the day of its foundation. Just wait
      about five minutes to let her punish us, before you out with it. &lsquo;Twill
      come best from you. What did you go down there for? But don&rsquo;t stand
      answering questions; come along. Don&rsquo;t heed her countenance at the going
      in: we&rsquo;ve got the talisman. As to the dressing, it&rsquo;s a perfect trick of
      harlequinade, and she&rsquo;ll own it after a dose of Earlsfont. And, by the
      way, she&rsquo;s not Mrs. Con, remember; she&rsquo;s Mrs. Adister O&rsquo;Donnell: and
      that&rsquo;s best rolled out to Mistress. She&rsquo;s a worthy woman, but she was
      married at forty, and I had to take her shaped as she was, for moulding
      her at all was out of the question, and the soft parts of me had to be the
      sufferers, to effect a conjunction, for where one won&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t, poor t&rsquo; 
      other must, or the union&rsquo;s a mockery. She was cast in bronze at her birth,
      if she wasn&rsquo;t cut in bog-root. Anyhow, you&rsquo;ll study her. Consider her for
      my sake. Madam, it should be&mdash;madam, call her, addressing her, madam.
      She hasn&rsquo;t a taste for jokes, and she chastises absurdities, and England&rsquo;s
      the foremost country of the globe, indirect communication with heaven, and
      only to be connected with such a country by the tail of it is a special
      distinction and a comfort for us; we&rsquo;re that part of the kite!&mdash;but,
      Patrick, she&rsquo;s a charitable soul; she&rsquo;s a virtuous woman and an
      affectionate wife, and doesn&rsquo;t frown to see me turn off to my place of
      worship while she drum-majors it away to her own; she entertains Father
      Boyle heartily, like the good woman she is to good men; and unfortunate
      females too have a friend in her, a real friend&mdash;that they have; and
      that &lsquo;s a wonder in a woman chaste as ice. I do respect her; and I&rsquo;d like
      to see the man to favour me with an opportunity of proving it on him! So
      you&rsquo;ll not forget, my boy; and prepare for a cold bath the first five
      minutes. Out with Earlsfont early after that. All these things are trifles
      to an unmarried man. I have to attend to &lsquo;m, I have to be politic and give
      her elbow-room for her natural angles. &lsquo;Tis the secret of my happiness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Priming his kinsman thus up to the door of the diningroom, Captain Con
      thrust him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistress Adister O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s head rounded as by slow attraction to the
      clock. Her disciplined husband signified an equal mixture of contrition
      and astonishment at the passing of time. He fell to work upon his plate in
      obedience to the immediate policy dictated to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unbending English lady contrasted with her husband so signally that
      the oddly united couple appeared yoked in a common harness for a perpetual
      display of the opposition of the races. She resembled her brother, the
      lord of Earlsfont, in her remarkable height and her calm air of authority
      and self-sustainment. From beneath a head-dress built of white curls and
      costly lace, half enclosing her high narrow forehead, a pale, thin,
      straight bridge of nose descended prominently over her sunken cheeks to
      thin locked lips. Her aspect suggested the repose of a winter landscape,
      enjoyable in pictures, or on skates, otherwise nipping.... Mental
      directness, of no greater breadth than her principal feature, was the
      character it expressed; and candour of spirit shone through the
      transparency she was, if that mild taper could be said to shine in proof
      of a vitality rarely notified to the outer world by the opening of her
      mouth; chiefly then, though not malevolently to command: as the portal of
      some snow-bound monastery opens to the outcast, bidding it be known that
      the light across the wolds was not deceptive and a glimmer of light
      subsists among the silent within. The life sufficed to her. She was like a
      marble effigy seated upright, requiring but to be laid at her length for
      transport to the cover of the tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Captain Con was by nature ruddy as an Indian summer flushed in all its
      leaves. The corners of his face had everywhere a frank ambush, or child&rsquo;s
      hiding-place, for languages and laughter. He could worm with a smile quite
      his own the humour out of men possessing any; and even under rigorous law,
      and it could not be disputed that there was rigour in the beneficent laws
      imposed upon him by his wife, his genius for humour and passion for sly
      independence came up and curled away like the smoke of the illicit still,
      wherein the fanciful discern fine sprites indulging in luxurious grimaces
      at a government long-nosed to no purpose. Perhaps, as Patrick said of him
      to Caroline Adister, he was a bard without a theme. He certainly was a man
      of speech, and the having fearfully to contain himself for the greater
      number of the hours of the day, for the preservation of the domestic
      felicity he had learnt to value, fathered the sentiment of revolt in his
      bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, long after five minutes had elapsed, the frost presiding at
      the table was fast withering Captain Con; and he was irritable to hear why
      Patrick had gone off to Earlsfont, and what he had done there, and the
      adventures he had tasted on the road; anything for warmth. His efforts to
      fish the word out of Patrick produced deeper crevasses in the
      conversation, and he cried to himself: Hats and crape-bands! mightily
      struck by an idea that he and his cousins were a party of hired mourners
      over the meat they consumed. Patrick was endeavouring to spare his brother
      a mention of Earlsfont before they had private talk together. He answered
      neither to a dip of the hook nor to a pull.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The desert where you &lsquo;ve come from &lsquo;s good,&rsquo; said the captain, sharply
      nodding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Adister O&rsquo;Donnell ejaculated: &lsquo;Wine!&rsquo; for a heavy comment upon one of
      his topics, and crushed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip saw that Patrick had no desire to spread, and did not trouble him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good horses in the stable too,&rsquo; said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick addressed Mrs. Adister: &lsquo;I have hardly excused myself to you,
      madam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her head was aloft in dumb apostrophe of wearifulness over another of her
      husband&rsquo;s topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not excuse yourself at all,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain shivered. He overhauled his plotting soul publicly: &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t
      you out with it yourself!&rsquo; and it was wonderful why he had not done so,
      save that he was prone to petty conspiracy, and had thought reasonably
      that the revelation would be damp, gunpowder, coming from him. And for
      when he added: &lsquo;The boy&rsquo;s fresh from Earlsfont; he went down to look at
      the brav old house of the Adisters, and was nobly welcomed and
      entertained, and made a vast impression,&rsquo; his wife sedately remarked to
      Patrick, &lsquo;You have seen my brother Edward.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And brings a message of his love to you, my dear,&rsquo; the Captain bit his
      nail harder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have a message for me?&rsquo; she asked; and Patrick replied: &lsquo;The captain
      is giving a free translation. I was down there, and I took the liberty of
      calling on Mr. Adister, and I had a very kind reception. We hunted, we had
      a good day with the hounds. I think I remember hearing that you go there
      at Christmas, madam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our last Christmas at Earlsfont was a sad meeting for the family. My
      brother Edward is well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had the happiness to be told that I had been of a little service in
      cheering him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can believe it,&rsquo; said Mrs. Adister, letting her eyes dwell on the young
      man; and he was moved by the silvery tremulousness of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She resumed: &lsquo;You have the art of dressing in a surprisingly short time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; exclaimed Captain Con: for no man can hear the words which prove
      him a prophet without showing excitement. &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say so? Patrick&rsquo;s a
      hero for love or war, my dear. He stood neat and trim from the silk socks
      to the sprig of necktie in six minutes by my watch. And that&rsquo;s witness to
      me that you may count on him for what the great Napoleon called
      two-o&rsquo;clock-in-the-morning courage; not too common even in his immortal
      army:&mdash;when it&rsquo;s pitch black and frosty cold, and you&rsquo;re buried
      within in a dream of home, and the trumpet springs you to your legs in a
      trice, boots and trowsers, coat and sword-belt and shako, and one twirl to
      the whiskers, and away before a second snap of the fingers to where the
      great big bursting end of all things for you lies crouching like a
      Java-Tiger&mdash;a ferocious beast painted undertaker&rsquo;s colour&mdash;for a
      leap at you in particular out of the dark;&mdash;never waiting an instant
      to ask what&rsquo;s the matter and pretend you don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s rare, Philip;
      that&rsquo;s bravery; Napoleon knew the thing; and Patrick has it; my hand&rsquo;s on
      the boy&rsquo;s back for that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain was permitted to discourse as he pleased: his wife was wholly
      given to the recent visitor to Earlsfont, whom she informed that Caroline
      was the youngest daughter of General Adister, her second brother, and an
      excellent maiden, her dear Edward&rsquo;s mainstay in his grief. At last she
      rose, and was escorted to the door by all present. But Captain Con rather
      shame-facedly explained to Patrick that it was a sham departure; they had
      to follow without a single spin to the claretjug: he closed the door
      merely to state his position; how at half-past ten he would be a free man,
      according to the convention, to which his wife honourably adhered, so he
      had to do likewise, as regarded his share of it. Thereupon he apologised
      to the brothers, bitterly regretting that, with good wine in the cellar,
      his could be no house for claret; and promising them they should sit in
      their shirts and stretch their legs, and toast the old country and open
      their hearts, no later than the minute pointing to the time for his
      deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Adister accepted her husband&rsquo;s proffered arm unhesitatingly at the
      appointed stroke of the clock. She said: &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; in agreement with him, as
      if she had never heard him previously enunciate the formula, upon his
      pious vociferation that there should be no trifling with her hours of
      rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can find your way to my cabin,&rsquo; he said to Philip over his shoulder,
      full of solicitude for the steps of the admirable lady now positively
      departing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the brothers were alone, Philip laid his hand on Patrick,
      asking him, &lsquo;What does it mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick fired his cannon-shot: &lsquo;She&rsquo;s married!&rsquo; Consulting his feelings
      immediately after, he hated himself for his bluntness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip tossed his head. &lsquo;But why did you go down there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I went,&rsquo; said Patrick, &lsquo;well, I went.... I thought you looked wretched,
      and I went with an idea of learning where she was, and seeing if I
      couldn&rsquo;t do something. It&rsquo;s too late now; all&rsquo;s over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear boy, I&rsquo;ve worse than that to think of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mind it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s old news, Patrick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t care for her any more, Philip?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have me caring for a married woman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has a perfect beast for a husband.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry she didn&rsquo;t make a better choice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a prince.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I hear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! And what worse, Philip, can you be having to think of?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Affairs,&rsquo; Philip replied, and made his way to the cabin of Captain Con,
      followed in wonderment by Patrick, who would hardly have been his dupe to
      suppose him indifferent and his love of Adiante dead, had not the thought
      flashed on him a prospect of retaining the miniature for his own, or for
      long in his custody.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. THE CAPTAIN&rsquo;S CABIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Patrick left his brother at the second flight of stairs to run and fling
      on a shooting-jacket, into which he stuffed his treasure, after one peep
      that eclipsed his little dream of being allowed to keep it; and so he saw
      through Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain&rsquo;s cabin was the crown of his house-top, a builder&rsquo;s addition
      to the roof, where the detestable deeds he revelled in, calling them
      liberty, could be practised, according to the convention, and no one save
      rosy Mary, in her sense of smell, when she came upon her morning business
      to clean and sweep, be any the wiser of them, because, as it is known to
      the whole world, smoke ascends, and he was up among the chimneys. Here, he
      would say to his friends and fellow-sinners, you can unfold, unbosom,
      explode, do all you like, except caper, and there &lsquo;s a small square of
      lead between the tiles outside for that, if the spirit of the jig comes
      upon you with violence, as I have had it on me, and eased myself mightily
      there, to my own music; and the capital of the British Empire below me.
      Here we take our indemnity for subjection to the tyrannical female ear,
      and talk like copious rivers meandering at their own sweet will. Here we
      roll like dogs in carrion, and no one to sniff at our coats. Here we sing
      treason, here we flout reason, night is out season at half-past ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      This introductory ode to Freedom was his throwing off of steam, the
      foretaste of what he contained. He rejoined his cousins, chirping
      variations on it, and attired in a green silken suit of airy Ottoman
      volume, full of incitement to the legs and arms to swing and set him up
      for a Sultan. &lsquo;Now Phil, now Pat,&rsquo; he cried, after tenderly pulling the
      door to and making sure it was shut, &lsquo;any tale you&rsquo;ve a mind for&mdash;infamous
      and audacious! You&rsquo;re licensed by the gods up here, and may laugh at them
      too, and their mothers and grandmothers, if the fit seizes ye, and the
      heartier it is the greater the exemption. We&rsquo;re pots that knock the lid
      and must pour out or boil over and destroy the furniture. My praties are
      ready for peelin&rsquo;, if ever they were in this world! Chuck wigs from
      sconces, and off with your buckram. Decency&rsquo;s a dirty petticoat in the
      Garden of Innocence. Naked we stand, boys! we&rsquo;re not afraid of nature.
      You&rsquo;re in the annexe of Erin, Pat, and devil a constable at the keyhole;
      no rats; I&rsquo;ll say that for the Government, though it&rsquo;s a despotism with an
      iron bridle on the tongue outside to a foot of the door. Arctic to freeze
      the boldest bud of liberty! I&rsquo;d like a French chanson from ye, Pat, to put
      us in tune, with a right revolutionary hurling chorus, that pitches Kings&rsquo; 
      heads into the basket like autumn apples. Or one of your hymns in Gaelic
      sung ferociously to sound as horrid to the Saxon, the wretch. His reign &lsquo;s
      not for ever; he can&rsquo;t enter here. You&rsquo;re in the stronghold defying him.
      And now cigars, boys, pipes; there are the boxes, there are the bowls. I
      can&rsquo;t smoke till I have done steaming. I&rsquo;ll sit awhile silently for the
      operation. Christendom hasn&rsquo;t such a man as your cousin Con for feeling
      himself a pig-possessed all the blessed day, acting the part of somebody
      else, till it takes me a quarter of an hour of my enfranchisement and
      restoration of my natural man to know myself again. For the moment, I&rsquo;m
      froth, scum, horrid boiling hissing dew of the agony of transformation; I
      am; I&rsquo;m that pig disgorging the spirit of wickedness from his poor
      stomach.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain drooped to represent the state of the self-relieving victim of
      the evil one; but fearful lest either of his cousins should usurp the
      chair and thwart his chance of delivering himself, he rattled away
      sympathetically with his posture in melancholy: &lsquo;Ay, we&rsquo;re poor creatures;
      pigs and prophets, princes and people, victors and vanquished, we &lsquo;re
      waves of the sea, rolling over and over, and calling it life! There&rsquo;s no
      life save the eternal. Father Boyle&rsquo;s got the truth. Flesh is less than
      grass, my sons; &lsquo;tis the shadow that crosses the grass. I love the grass.
      I could sit and watch grassblades for hours. I love an old turf mound,
      where the grey grass nods and seems to know the wind and have a whisper
      with it, of ancient times maybe and most like; about the big chief lying
      underneath in the last must of his bones that a breath of air would
      scatter. They just keep their skeleton shape as they are; for the turf
      mound protects them from troubles: &lsquo;tis the nurse to that delicate old
      infant!&mdash;Waves of the sea, did I say? We&rsquo;re wash in a hog-trough for
      Father Saturn to devour; big chief and suckling babe, we all go into it,
      calling it life! And what hope have we of reading the mystery? All we can
      see is the straining of the old fellow&rsquo;s hams to push his old snout deeper
      into the gobble, and the ridiculous curl of a tail totally devoid of
      expression! You&rsquo;ll observe that gluttons have no feature; they&rsquo;re jaws and
      hindquarters; which is the beginning and end of &lsquo;m; and so you may say to
      Time for his dealing with us: so let it be a lesson to you not to bother
      your wits, but leave the puzzle to the priest. He understands it, and why?
      because he was told. There &lsquo;s harmony in his elocution, and there&rsquo;s none
      in the modern drivel about where we&rsquo;re going and what we came out of. No
      wonder they call it an age of despair, when you see the big wigs filing up
      and down the thoroughfares with a great advertisement board on their
      shoulders, proclaiming no information to the multitude, but a blank note
      of interrogation addressed to Providence, as if an answer from above would
      be vouchsafed to their impudence! They haven&rsquo;t the first principles of
      good manners. And some of &lsquo;m in a rage bawl the answer for themselves.
      Hear that! No, Phil; No, Pat, no: devotion&rsquo;s good policy.&mdash;You&rsquo;re not
      drinking! Are you both of ye asleep? why do ye leave me to drone away like
      this, when it &lsquo;s conversation I want, as in the days of our first parents,
      before the fig-leaf?&mdash;and you might have that for scroll and figure
      on the social banner of the hypocritical Saxon, who&rsquo;s a gormandising
      animal behind his decency, and nearer to the Arch-devourer Time than
      anything I can imagine: except that with a little exertion you can elude
      him. The whisky you&rsquo;ve got between you &lsquo;s virgin of the excise. I&rsquo;ll pay
      double for freepeaty any day. Or are you for claret, my lads? No? I&rsquo;m
      fortified up here to stand a siege in my old round tower, like the son of
      Eremon that I am. Lavra Con! Con speaks at last! I don&rsquo;t ask you, Pat,
      whether you remember Maen, who was born dumb, and had for his tutors
      Ferkelne the bard and Crafting the harper, at pleasant Dinree: he was
      grandson of Leary Lore who was basely murdered by his brother Cova, and
      Cova spared the dumb boy, thinking a man without a tongue harmless, as
      fools do: being one of their savings-bank tricks, to be repaid them, their
      heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns at compound interest, have
      no fear. So one day Maen had an insult put on him; and &lsquo;twas this for
      certain: a ruffian fellow of the Court swore he couldn&rsquo;t mention the name
      of his father; and in a thundering fury Maen burst his tongue-tie, and the
      Court shouted Lavra Maen: and he had to go into exile, where he married in
      the middle of delicious love-adventures the beautiful Moira through the
      cunning of Craftine the harper. There&rsquo;s been no harper in my instance but
      plenty of ruffians to swear I&rsquo;m too comfortable to think of my country.&rsquo; 
      The captain holloaed. &lsquo;Do they hear that? Lord! but wouldn&rsquo;t our old
      Celtic fill the world with poetry if only we were a free people to give
      our minds to &lsquo;t, instead of to the itch on our backs from the Saxon
      horsehair shirt we&rsquo;re forced to wear. For, Pat, as you know, we&rsquo;re a
      loving people, we&rsquo;re a loyal people, we burn to be enthusiastic, but when
      our skins are eternally irritated, how can we sing? In a freer Erin I&rsquo;d be
      the bard of the land, never doubt it. What am I here but a discontented
      idle lout crooning over the empty glories of our isle of Saints! You feel
      them, Pat. Phil&rsquo;s all for his British army, his capabilities of British
      light cavalry. Write me the history of the Enniskillens. I&rsquo;ll read it.
      Aha, my boy, when they &lsquo;re off at the charge! And you&rsquo;ll oblige me with
      the tale of Fontenoy. Why, Phil has an opportunity stretching forth a hand
      to him now more than halfway that comes to a young Irishman but once in a
      century: backed by the entire body of the priesthood of Ireland too! and
      if only he was a quarter as full of the old country as you and I, his hair
      would stand up in fire for the splendid gallop at our head that&rsquo;s proposed
      to him. His country&rsquo;s gathered up like a crested billow to roll him into
      Parliament; and I say, let him be there, he &lsquo;s the very man to hurl his
      gauntlet, and tell &lsquo;m, Parliament, so long as you are parliamentary, which
      means the speaking of our minds, but if you won&rsquo;t have it, then-and it &lsquo;s
      on your heads before Europe and the two Americas. We&rsquo;re dying like a nun
      that &lsquo;d be out of her cloister, we&rsquo;re panting like the wife who hears of
      her husband coming home to her from the field of honour, for that young
      man. And there he is; or there he seems to be; but he&rsquo;s dead: and the
      fisherman off the west coast after dreaming of a magical haul, gets more
      fish than disappointment in comparison with us when we cast the net for
      Philip. Bring tears of vexation at the emptiness we pull back for our
      pains. Oh, Phil! and to think of your youth! We had you then. At least we
      had your heart. And we should have had the length and strength of you,
      only for a woman fatal to us as the daughter of Rhys ap Tudor, the
      beautiful Nesta:&mdash;and beautiful she was to match the mother of the
      curses trooping over to Ireland under Strongbow, that I&rsquo;ll grant you. But
      she reined you in when you were a real warhorse ramping and snorting flame
      from your nostrils, challenging any other to a race for Ireland; ay, a
      Cuchullin you were, Philip, Culann&rsquo;s chain-bound: but she unmanned you.
      She soaked the woman into you and squeezed the hero out of you. All for
      Adiante! or a country left to slavery! that&rsquo;s the tale. And what are you
      now? A paltry captain of hussars on the General&rsquo;s staff! One O&rsquo;Donnell in
      a thousand! And what is she?&mdash;you needn&rsquo;t frown, Phil; I&rsquo;m her
      relative by marriage, and she &lsquo;s a lady. More than that, she shot a dart
      or two into my breast in those days, she did, I&rsquo;ll own it: I had the catch
      of the breath that warns us of convulsions. She was the morning star for
      beauty, between night and day, and the best colour of both. Welshmen and
      Irishmen and Englishmen tumbled into the pit, which seeing her was, and
      there we jostled for a glimpse quite companionably; we were too hungry for
      quarrelling; and to say, I was one of &lsquo;m, is a title to subsequent
      friendship. True; only mark me, Philip, and you, Patrick: they say she has
      married a prince, and I say no; she&rsquo;s took to herself a husband in her
      cradle; she&rsquo;s married ambition. I tell you, and this prince of hers is
      only a step she has taken, and if he chases her first mate from her bosom,
      he&rsquo;ll prove himself cleverer than she, and I dare him to the trial. For
      she&rsquo;s that fiery dragon, a beautiful woman with brains&mdash;which Helen
      of Troy hadn&rsquo;t, combustible as we know her to have been: but brains are
      bombshells in comparison with your old-fashioned pine-brands for kindling
      men and cities. Ambition&rsquo;s the husband of Adiante Adister, and all who
      come nigh her are steps to her aim. She never consulted her father about
      Prince Nikolas; she had begun her march and she didn&rsquo;t mean to be
      arrested. She simply announced her approaching union; and as she couldn&rsquo;t
      have a scion of one of the Royal House of Europe, she put her foot on
      Prince Nikolas. And he &lsquo;s not to fancy he &lsquo;s in for a peaceful existence;
      he&rsquo;s a stone in a sling, and probably mistaken the rocking that&rsquo;s to
      launch him through the air for a condition of remarkable ease, perfectly
      remarkable in its lullaby motion; ha! well, and I&rsquo;ve not heard of ambition
      that didn&rsquo;t kill its votary: somehow it will; &lsquo;tis sure to. There she
      lies!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The prophetic captain pointed at the spot. He then said: &lsquo;And now I&rsquo;m for
      my pipe, and the blackest clay of the party, with your permission. I&rsquo;ll
      just go to the window to see if the stars are out overhead. They&rsquo;re my
      blessed guardian angels.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. Philip broke from a brown study to glance at his
      brother. Patrick made a queer face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fun and good-fellowship to-night, Con,&rsquo; said Philip, as the captain sadly
      reported no star visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have I ever flown a signal to the contrary?&rsquo; retorted the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No politics, and I &lsquo;ll thank you,&rsquo; said Philip: &lsquo;none of your early
      recollections. Be jovial.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You should have seen me here the other night about a month ago; I
      smuggled up an old countrywoman of ours, with the connivance of rosy
      Mary,&rsquo; said Captain Con, suffused in the merriest of grins. &lsquo;She sells
      apples at a stall at a corner of a street hard by, and I saw her sitting
      pulling at her old pipe in the cold October fog morning and evening for
      comfort, and was overwhelmed with compassion and fraternal sentiment; and
      so I invited her to be at the door of the house at half-past ten, just to
      have a roll with her in Irish mud, and mend her torn soul with a stitch or
      two of rejoicing. She told me stories; and one was pretty good, of a
      relative of hers, or somebody&rsquo;s&mdash;I should say, a century old, but she
      told it with a becoming air of appropriation that made it family history,
      for she&rsquo;s come down in the world, and this fellow had a stain of red upon
      him, and wanted cleaning; and, &ldquo;What!&rdquo; says the good father, &ldquo;Mika! you
      did it in cold blood?&rdquo; And says Mika, &ldquo;Not I, your Riverence. I got myself
      into a passion &lsquo;fore I let loose.&rdquo; I believe she smoked this identical
      pipe. She acknowledged the merits of my whisky, as poets do hearing fine
      verses, never clapping hands, but with the expressiveness of grave
      absorption. That&rsquo;s the way to make good things a part of you. She was a
      treat. I got her out and off at midnight, rosy Mary sneaking her down, and
      the old girl quiet as a mouse for the fun&rsquo;s sake. The whole intrigue was
      exquisitely managed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You run great risks,&rsquo; Philip observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do,&rsquo; said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called on the brothers to admire the &lsquo;martial and fumial&rsquo; decorations
      of his round tower, buzzing over the display of implements, while Patrick
      examined guns and Philip unsheathed swords. An ancient clay pipe from the
      bed of the Thames and one from the bed of the Boyne were laid side by
      side, and strange to relate, the Irish pipe and English immediately, by
      the mere fact of their being proximate, entered into rivalry; they all but
      leapt upon one another. The captain judicially decided the case against
      the English pipe, as a newer pipe of grosser manufacture, not so curious
      by any means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This,&rsquo; Philip held up the reputed Irish pipe, and scanned as he twirled
      it on his thumb, &lsquo;This was dropped in Boyne Water by one of William&rsquo;s
      troopers. It is an Orange pipe. I take it to be of English make.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I thought that, I&rsquo;d stamp my heel on the humbug the neighbour minute,&rsquo; 
      said Captain Con. &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the sign of English marks?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The pipes resemble one another,&rsquo; said Philip, &lsquo;like tails of Shannon-bred
      retrievers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Maybe they &lsquo;re both Irish, then?&rsquo; the captain caught at analogy to rescue
      his favourite from reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Both of them are Saxon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit of it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look at the clay.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I look, and I tell you, Philip, it&rsquo;s of a piece with your lukewarmness
      for the country, or you wouldn&rsquo;t talk like that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no record of pipe manufactories in Ireland at the period you
      name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is: and the jealousy of rulers caused them to be destroyed by
      decrees, if you want historical evidence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your opposition to the Saxon would rob him of his pipe, Con!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let him go to the deuce with as many pipes as he can carry; but he shan&rsquo;t
      have this one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a toss-up of difference is to be seen in the pair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Use your eyes. The Irish bowl is broken, and the English has an inch
      longer stem!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O the Irish bowl is broken!&rsquo; Philip sang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve the heart of a renegade-foreigner not to see it!&rsquo; cried the
      captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick intervened saying: &lsquo;I suspect they&rsquo;re Dutch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and that &lsquo;s possible.&rsquo; Captain Con scrutinised them to calm his
      temper: &lsquo;there&rsquo;s a Dutchiness in the shape.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He offered Philip the compromise of &lsquo;Dutch&rsquo; rather plaintively, but it was
      not accepted, and the pipes would have mingled their fragments on the
      hearthstone if Patrick had not stayed his arm, saying: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I won&rsquo;t,&rsquo; the captain shook his hand gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But will Philip O&rsquo;Donnell tell me that Ireland should lie down with
      England on the terms of a traveller obliged to take a bedfellow? Come! He
      hasn&rsquo;t an answer. Put it to him, and you pose him. But he &lsquo;ll not stir,
      though he admits the antagonism. And Ireland is asked to lie down with
      England on a couch blessed by the priest! Not she. Wipe out our
      grievances, and then we&rsquo;ll begin to talk of policy. Good Lord!&mdash;love?
      The love of Ireland for the conquering country will be the celebrated
      ceremony in the concluding chapter previous to the inauguration of the
      millennium. Thousands of us are in a starving state at home this winter,
      Patrick. And it&rsquo;s not the fault of England?&mdash;landlordism &lsquo;s not? Who
      caused the ruin of all Ireland&rsquo;s industries? You might as well say that it
      &lsquo;s the fault of the poor beggar to go limping and hungry because his cruel
      master struck him a blow to cripple him. We don&rsquo;t want half and half
      doctoring, and it&rsquo;s too late in the day for half and half oratory. We want
      freedom, and we&rsquo;ll have it, and we won&rsquo;t leave it to the Saxon to think
      about giving it. And if your brother Philip won&rsquo;t accept this blazing fine
      offer, then I will, and you&rsquo;ll behold me in a new attitude. The fellow
      yawns! You don&rsquo;t know me yet, Philip. They tell us over here we ought to
      be satisfied. Fall upon our list of wrongs, and they set to work yawning.
      You can only move them by popping at them over hedges and roaring on
      platforms. They&rsquo;re incapable of understanding a complaint a yard beyond
      their noses. The Englishman has an island mind, and when he&rsquo;s out of it
      he&rsquo;s at sea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mad, you mean,&rsquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I repeat my words, Captain Philip O&rsquo;Donnell, late of the staff of the
      General commanding in Canada.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Irishman too has an island mind, and when he&rsquo;s out of it he&rsquo;s at sea,
      and unable to manage his craft,&rsquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find more craft in him when he&rsquo;s buffeted than you reckoned on,&rsquo; 
      his cousin flung back. &lsquo;And if that isn&rsquo;t the speech of a traitor sold to
      the enemy, and now throwing off the mask, traitors never did mischief in
      Ireland! Why, what can you discover to admire in these people? Isn&rsquo;t their
      army such a combination of colours in the uniforms, with their yellow
      facings on red jackets, I never saw out of a doll-shop, and never saw
      there. And their Horse Guards, weedy to a man! fit for a doll-shop they
      are, by my faith! And their Foot Guards: Have ye met the fellows marching?
      with their feet turned out, flat as my laundress&rsquo;s irons, and the muscles
      of their calves depending on the joints to get &lsquo;m along, for elasticity
      never gave those bones of theirs a springing touch; and their bearskins
      heeling behind on their polls; like pot-house churls daring the dursn&rsquo;t to
      come on. Of course they can fight. Who said no? But they &lsquo;re not the only
      ones: and they &lsquo;ll miss their ranks before they can march like our Irish
      lads. The look of their men in line is for all the world to us what
      lack-lustre is to the eye. The drill they &lsquo;ve had hasn&rsquo;t driven Hodge out
      of them, it has only stiffened the dolt; and dolt won&rsquo;t do any longer; the
      military machine requires intelligence in all ranks now. Ay, the time for
      the Celt is dawning: I see it, and I don&rsquo;t often spy a spark where there
      isn&rsquo;t soon a blaze. Solidity and stupidity have had their innings: a
      precious long innings it has been; and now they&rsquo;re shoved aside like clods
      of earth from the risin flower. Off with our shackles! We&rsquo;ve only to
      determine it to be free, and we&rsquo;ll bloom again; and I&rsquo;ll be the first to
      speak the word and mount the colours. Follow me! Will ye join in the toast
      to the emblem of Erin&mdash;the shamrock, Phil and Pat?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, certainly,&rsquo; said Philip. &lsquo;What &lsquo;s that row going on?&rsquo; Patrick also
      called attention to the singular noise in the room. &lsquo;I fancy the time for
      the Celt is not dawning, but setting,&rsquo; said Philip, with a sharp smile;
      and Patrick wore an artful look.
    </p>
    <p>
      A corner of the room was guilty of the incessant alarum. Captain Con gazed
      in that direction incredulously and with remonstrance. &lsquo;The tinkler it
      is!&rsquo; he sighed. &lsquo;But it can&rsquo;t be midnight yet?&rsquo; Watches were examined.
      Time stood at half-past the midnight. He groaned: &lsquo;I must go. I haven&rsquo;t
      heard the tinkler for months. It signifies she&rsquo;s cold in her bed. The
      thing called circulation&rsquo;s unknown to her save by the aid of outward
      application, and I &lsquo;m the warming pan, as legitimately I should be, I&rsquo;m
      her husband and her Harvey in one. Goodbye to my hop and skip. I ought by
      rights to have been down beside her at midnight. She&rsquo;s the worthiest woman
      alive, and I don&rsquo;t shirk my duty. Be quiet!&rsquo; he bellowed at the alarum; &lsquo;I
      &lsquo;m coming. Don&rsquo;t be in such a fright, my dear,&rsquo; he admonished it as his
      wife, politely. &lsquo;Your hand&rsquo;ll take an hour to warm if you keep it out on
      the spring that sets the creature going.&rsquo; He turned and informed his
      company: &lsquo;Her hand&rsquo;ll take an hour to warm. Dear! how she runs ahead: d&rsquo; 
      ye hear? That&rsquo;s the female tongue, and once off it won&rsquo;t stop. And this
      contrivance for fetching me from my tower to her bed was my own
      suggestion, in a fit of generosity! Ireland all over! I must hurry and
      wash my hair, for she can&rsquo;t bear a perfume to kill a stink; she carries
      her charitable heart that far. Good-night, I&rsquo;ll be thinking of ye while
      I&rsquo;m warming her. Sit still, I can&rsquo;t wait; &lsquo;tis the secret of my
      happiness.&rsquo; He fled. Patrick struck his knee on hearing the expected
      ballad-burden recur.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. THE BROTHERS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &lsquo;Con has learnt one secret,&rsquo; said Philip, quitting his chair.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Patrick went up to him, and, &lsquo;Give us a hug,&rsquo; he said, and the hug was
      given.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were of an equal height, tall young men, alert, nervously braced from
      head to foot, with the differences between soldier and civilian marked by
      the succintly military bearing of the elder brother, whose movements were
      precise and prompt, and whose frame was leopardlike in indolence. Beside
      him Patrick seemed cubbish, though beside another he would not have
      appeared so. His features were not so brilliantly regular, but were a
      fanciful sketch of the same design, showing a wider pattern of the long
      square head and the forehead, a wavering at the dip of the nose, livelier
      nostrils: the nostrils dilated and contracted, and were exceeding alive.
      His eyelids had to do with the look of his eyes, and were often seen
      cutting the ball. Philip&rsquo;s eyes were large on the pent of his brows, open,
      liquid, and quick with the fire in him. Eyes of that quality are the
      visible mind, animated both to speak it and to render it what comes within
      their scope. They were full, unshaded direct, the man himself, in action.
      Patrick&rsquo;s mouth had to be studied for an additional index to the
      character. To symbolise them, they were as a sword-blade lying beside
      book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men would have thought Patrick the slippery one of the two: women would
      have inclined to confide in him the more thoroughly; they bring feeling to
      the test, and do not so much read a print as read the imprinting on
      themselves; and the report that a certain one of us is true as steel, must
      be unanimous at a propitious hour to assure them completely that the steel
      is not two-edged in the fully formed nature of a man whom they have not
      tried. They are more at home with the unformed, which lends itself to
      feeling and imagination. Besides Patrick came nearer to them; he showed
      sensibility. They have it, and they deem it auspicious of goodness, or of
      the gentleness acceptable as an equivalent. Not the less was Philip the
      one to inspire the deeper and the wilder passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you&rsquo;ve been down there?&rsquo; said Philip. &lsquo;Tell us of your welcome. Never
      mind why you went: I think I see. You&rsquo;re the Patrick of fourteen, who
      tramped across Connaught for young Dermot to have a sight of you before he
      died, poor lad. How did Mr. Adister receive you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick described the first interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip mused over it. &lsquo;Yes, those are some of his ideas: gentlemen are to
      excel in the knightly exercises. He used to fence excellently, and he was
      a good horseman. The Jesuit seminary would have been hard for him to
      swallow once. The house is a fine old house: lonely, I suppose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick spoke of Caroline Adister and pursued his narrative. Philip was
      lost in thought. At the conclusion, relating to South America, he raised
      his head and said: &lsquo;Not so foolish as it struck you, Patrick. You and I
      might do that,&mdash;without the design upon the original owner of the
      soil! Irishmen are better out of Europe, unless they enter one of the
      Continental services.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it Con O&rsquo;Donnell proposes to you?&rsquo; Patrick asked him earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be a speaking trumpet in Parliament. And to put it first among the
      objections, I haven&rsquo;t an independence; not above two hundred a year.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make it a thousand,&rsquo; said Patrick, &lsquo;that is, if my people can pay.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Secondly, I don&rsquo;t want to give up my profession. Thirdly, fourthly,
      fifthly, once there, I should be boiling with the rest. I never could go
      half way. This idea of a commencement gives me a view of the finish. Would
      you care to try it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I&rsquo;m no wiser after two or three years of the world I mean to make a
      better acquaintance with,&rsquo; Patrick replied. &lsquo;Over there at home one
      catches the fever, you know. They have my feelings, and part of my
      judgement, and whether that&rsquo;s the weaker part I can&rsquo;t at present decide.
      My taste is for quiet farming and breeding.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Friendship, as far as possible; union, if the terms are fair,&rsquo; said
      Philip. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only the name of union now; supposing it a concession that
      is asked of them; say, sacrifice; it might be made for the sake of what
      our people would do to strengthen the nation. But they won&rsquo;t try to
      understand our people. Their laws, and their rules, their systems are
      forced on a race of an opposite temper, who would get on well enough, and
      thrive, if they were properly consulted. Ireland &lsquo;s the sore place of
      England, and I&rsquo;m sorry for it. We ought to be a solid square, with Europe
      in this pickle. So I say, sitting here. What should I be saying in
      Parliament?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Con at all likely, do you think, Philip?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He might: and become the burlesque Irishman of the House. There must be
      one, and the lot would be safe to fall on him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t he serious about it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite, I fancy; and that will be the fun. A serious fellow talking
      nonsense with lively illustrations, is just the man for House of Commons
      clown. Your humorous rogue is not half so taking. Con would be the
      porpoise in a fish tank there, inscrutably busy on his errand and watched
      for his tumblings. Better I than he; and I should make a worse of it&mdash;at
      least for myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t the secret of his happiness interfere?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he has the secret inside his common sense. The bulk of it I suspect to
      be, that he enjoys his luxuries and is ashamed of his laziness; and so the
      secret pulls both ways. One day a fit of pride may have him, or one of his
      warm impulses, and if he&rsquo;s taken in the tide of it, I shall grieve for the
      secret.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You like his wife, Philip?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I respect her. They came together,&mdash;I suppose, because they were
      near together, like the two islands, in spite of the rolling waves
      between. I would not willingly see the union disturbed. He warms her, and
      she houses him. And he has to control the hot blood that does the warming,
      and she to moderate the severity of her principles, which are an essential
      part of the housing. Oh! shiver politics, Patrice. I wish I had been bred
      in France: a couple of years with your Pere Clement, and I could have met
      Irishmen and felt to them as an Irishman, whether they were disaffected or
      not. I wish I did. When I landed the other day, I thought myself passably
      cured, and could have said that rhetoric is the fire-water of our country,
      and claptrap the springboard to send us diving into it. I like my
      comrades-in-arms, I like the character of British officers, and the men
      too&mdash;I get on well with them. I declare to you, Patrice, I burn to
      live in brotherhood with them, not a rift of division at heart! I never
      show them that there is one. But our early training has us; it comes on us
      again; three or four days with Con have stirred me; I don&rsquo;t let him see
      it, but they always do: these tales of starvations and shootings, all the
      old work just as when I left, act on me like a smell of powder. I was
      dipped in &ldquo;Ireland for the Irish&rdquo;; and a contented Irishman scarcely seems
      my countryman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose it &lsquo;s like what I hear of as digesting with difficulty,&rsquo; 
      Patrick referred to the state described by his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And not the most agreeable of food,&rsquo; Philip added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be the secret of our happiness to discover how to make the best
      of it, if we had to pay penance for the discovery by living in an
      Esquimaux shanty,&rsquo; said Patrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With a frozen fish of admirable principles for wife,&rsquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, you give me shudders!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And it&rsquo;s her guest who talks of her in that style! and I hope to be
      thought a gentleman!&rsquo; Philip pulled himself up. &lsquo;We may be all in the
      wrong. The way to begin to think so, is to do them an injury and forget
      it. The sensation&rsquo;s not unpleasant when it&rsquo;s other than a question of good
      taste. But politics to bed, Patrice. My chief is right&mdash;soldiers have
      nothing to do with them. What are you fiddling at in your coat there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something for you, my dear Philip.&rsquo; Patrick brought out the miniature. He
      held it for his brother to look. &lsquo;It was the only thing I could get. Mr.
      Adister sends it. The young lady, Miss Caroline, seconded me. They think
      more of the big portrait: I don&rsquo;t. And it &lsquo;s to be kept carefully, in case
      of the other one getting damaged. That&rsquo;s only fair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip drank in the face upon a swift shot of his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Adister sends it?&rsquo; His tone implied wonder at such a change in
      Adiante&rsquo;s father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And an invitation to you to visit him when you please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That he might do,&rsquo; said Philip: it was a lesser thing than to send her
      likeness to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick could not help dropping his voice: &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it very like?&rsquo; For
      answer the miniature had to be inspected closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was a Spartan for keeping his feelings under.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, after an interval quick with fiery touches on the history
      of that face and his life. &lsquo;Older, of course. They are the features, of
      course. The likeness is not bad. I suppose it resembles her as she is now,
      or was when it was painted. You &lsquo;re an odd fellow to have asked for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought you would wish to have it, Philip.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a good boy, Patrice. Light those candles we&rsquo;ll go to bed. I want a
      cool head for such brains as I have, and bumping the pillow all night is
      not exactly wholesome. We&rsquo;ll cross the Channel in a few days, and see the
      nest, and the mother, and the girls.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not St. George&rsquo;s Channel. Mother would rather you would go to France and
      visit the De Reuils. She and the girls hope you will keep out of Ireland
      for a time: it&rsquo;s hot. Judge if they&rsquo;re anxious, when it&rsquo;s to stop them
      from seeing you, Philip!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-night, dear boy.&rsquo; Philip checked the departing Patrick. &lsquo;You can
      leave that.&rsquo; He made a sign for the miniature to be left on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick laid it there. His brother had not touched it, and he could have
      defended himself for having forgotten to leave it, on the plea that it
      might prevent his brother from having his proper share of sleep; and also,
      that Philip had no great pleasure in the possession of it. The two pleas,
      however, did not make one harmonious apology, and he went straight to the
      door in an odd silence, with the step of a decorous office-clerk, keeping
      his shoulders turned on Philip to conceal his look of destitution.

      CHAPTER XI. INTRODUCING A NEW CHARACTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Letters and telegrams and morning journals lay on the breakfast-table,
      awaiting the members of the household with combustible matter. Bad news
      from Ireland came upon ominous news from India. Philip had ten words of
      mandate from his commanding officer, and they signified action, uncertain
      where. He was the soldier at once, buckled tight and buttoned up over his
      private sentiments. Vienna shot a line to Mrs. Adister O&rsquo;Donnell. She
      communicated it: &lsquo;The Princess Nikolas has a son!&rsquo; Captain Con tossed his
      newspaper to the floor, crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-day the city&rsquo;ll be a chimney on fire, with the blacks in everybody&rsquo;s
      faces; but I must go down. It&rsquo;s hen and chicks with the director of a City
      Company. I must go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you say, madam?&rsquo; Patrick inquired. &lsquo;A son,&rsquo; said Mrs. Adister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the military holloaing for reinforcements,&rsquo; exclaimed Con. &lsquo;Pheu!
      Phil!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what it comes to,&rsquo; was Philip&rsquo;s answer. &lsquo;Precautionary measures,
      eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can make them provocative.&rsquo; &lsquo;Will you beg for India?&rsquo; &lsquo;I shall hear
      in an hour.&rsquo; &lsquo;Have we got men?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Always the question with us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a country!&rsquo; sighed the captain. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d compose ye a song of old
      Drowsylid, except that it does no good to be singing it at the only time
      when you can show her the consequences of her sluggery. A country of
      compromise goes to pieces at the first cannon-shot of the advance, and
      while she&rsquo;s fighting on it&rsquo;s her poor business to be putting herself
      together again: So she makes a mess of the beginning, to a certainty. If
      it weren&rsquo;t that she had the army of Neptune about her&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The worst is she may some day start awake to discover that her protecting
      deity &lsquo;s been napping too.&mdash;A boy or girl did you say, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife replied: &lsquo;A son.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! more births.&rsquo; The captain appeared to be computing. &lsquo;But this one&rsquo;s
      out of England: and it&rsquo;s a prince I suppose they&rsquo;ll call him: and princes
      don&rsquo;t count in the population for more than finishing touches, like the
      crossing of t&rsquo;s and dotting of i&rsquo;s, though true they&rsquo;re the costliest,
      like some flowers and feathers, and they add to the lump on Barney&rsquo;s back.
      But who has any compassion for a burdened donkey? unless when you see him
      standing immortal meek! Well, and a child of some sort must have been
      expected? Because it&rsquo;s no miracle after marriage: worse luck for the
      crowded earth!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Things may not be expected which are profoundly distasteful,&rsquo; Mrs.
      Adister remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True,&rsquo; said her sympathetic husband. &lsquo; &lsquo;Tis like reading the list of the
      dead after a battle where you&rsquo;ve not had the best of it&mdash;each name &lsquo;s
      a startling new blow. I&rsquo;d offer to run to Earlsfont, but here&rsquo;s my company
      you would have me join for the directoring of it, you know, my dear, to
      ballast me, as you pretty clearly hinted; and all &lsquo;s in the city to-day
      like a loaf with bad yeast, thick as lead, and sour to boot. And a howl
      and growl coming off the wilds of Old Ireland! We&rsquo;re smitten to-day in our
      hearts and our pockets, and it &lsquo;s a question where we ought to feel it
      most, for the sake of our families.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you not observe that your cousins are not eating?&rsquo; said his wife,
      adding, to Patrick: &lsquo;I entertain the opinion that a sound
      breakfast-appetite testifies to the proper vigour of men.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Better than a doctor&rsquo;s pass: and to their habits likewise,&rsquo; Captain Con
      winked at his guests, begging them to steal ten minutes out of the fray
      for the inward fortification of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eggs in the shell, and masses of eggs, bacon delicately thin and curling
      like Apollo&rsquo;s locks at his temples, and cutlets, caviar, anchovies in the
      state of oil, were pressed with the captain&rsquo;s fervid illustrations upon
      the brothers, both meditatively nibbling toast and indifferent to the
      similes he drew and applied to life from the little fish which had their
      sharpness corrected but not cancelled by the improved liquid they swam in.
      &lsquo;Like an Irishman in clover,&rsquo; he said to his wife to pay her a compliment
      and coax an acknowledgement: &lsquo;just the flavour of the salt of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mind was on her brother Edward, and she could not look sweet-oily, as
      her husband wooed her to do, with impulse to act the thing he was
      imagining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And there is to-morrow&rsquo;s dinner-party to the Mattocks: I cannot travel to
      Earlsfont,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Patrick is a disengaged young verderer, and knows the route, and has a
      welcome face there, and he might go, if you&rsquo;re for having it performed by
      word of mouth. But, trust me, my dear, bad news is best communicated by
      telegraph, which gives us no stupid articles and particles to quarrel
      with. &ldquo;Boy born Vienna doctor smiling nurse laughing.&rdquo; That tells it all,
      straight to the understanding, without any sickly circumlocutory stuff;
      and there&rsquo;s nothing more offensive to us when we&rsquo;re hurt at intelligence.
      For the same reason, Colonel Arthur couldn&rsquo;t go, since you&rsquo;ll want him to
      meet the Mattocks?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Con&rsquo;s underlip shone with a roguish thinness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arthur must be here,&rsquo; said Mrs. Adister. &lsquo;I cannot bring myself to write
      it. I disapprove of telegrams.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was asking to be assisted, so her husband said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take Patrick for a secretary. Dictate. He has a bold free hand and&rsquo;ll
      supply all the fiorituri and arabesques necessary to the occasion
      running.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at Patrick as if to intimate that he might be enlisted, and
      said: &lsquo;It will be to Caroline. She will break it to her uncle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Right, madam, on the part of a lady I &lsquo;ve never known to be wrong! And
      so, my dear, I must take leave of you, to hurry down to the tormented
      intestines of that poor racked city, where the winds of panic are
      violently engaged in occupying the vacuum created by knocking over what
      the disaster left standing; and it &lsquo;ll much resemble a colliery accident
      there, I suspect, and a rescue of dead bodies. Adieu, my dear.&rsquo; He pressed
      his lips on her thin fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick placed himself at Mrs. Adister&rsquo;s disposal as her secretary. She
      nodded a gracious acceptance of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I recommended the telegraph because it&rsquo;s my wife&rsquo;s own style, and comes
      better from wires,&rsquo; said the captain, as they were putting on their
      overcoats in the hall. &lsquo;You must know the family. &ldquo;Deeds not words&rdquo; would
      serve for their motto. She hates writing, and doesn&rsquo;t much love talking.
      Pat &lsquo;ll lengthen her sentences for her. She&rsquo;s fond of Adiante, and she
      sympathises with her brother Edward made a grandfather through the
      instrumentality of that foreign hooknose; and Patrick must turn the two
      dagger sentiments to a sort of love-knot and there&rsquo;s the task he&rsquo;ll have
      to work out in his letter to Miss Caroline. It&rsquo;s fun about Colonel Arthur
      not going. He&rsquo;s to meet the burning Miss Mattock, who has gold on her
      crown and a lot on her treasury, Phil, my boy! but I&rsquo;m bound in honour not
      to propose it. And a nice girl, a prize; afresh healthy girl; and brains:
      the very girl! But she&rsquo;s jotted down for the Adisters, if Colonel Arthur
      can look lower than his nose and wag his tongue a bit. She&rsquo;s one to be a
      mother of stout ones that won&rsquo;t run up big doctors&rsquo; bills or ask
      assistance in growing. Her name&rsquo;s plain Jane, and she &lsquo;s a girl to breed
      conquerors; and the same you may say of her brother John, who &lsquo;s a mighty
      fit man, good at most things, though he counts his fortune in millions,
      which I&rsquo;ve heard is lighter for a beggar to perform than in pounds, but he
      can count seven, and beat any of us easy by showing them millions! We
      might do something for them at home with a million or two, Phil. It all
      came from the wedding of a railway contractor, who sprang from the wedding
      of a spade and a clod&mdash;and probably called himself Mattock at his
      birth, no shame to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re for the city,&rsquo; said Philip, after they had walked down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not I,&rsquo; said Con. &lsquo;Let them play Vesuvius down there. I&rsquo;ve got another in
      me: and I can&rsquo;t stop their eruption, and they wouldn&rsquo;t relish mine. I know
      a little of Dick Martin, who called on the people to resist, and housed
      the man Liffey after his firing the shot, and I&rsquo;m off to Peter M&rsquo;Christy,
      his brother-in-law. I&rsquo;ll see Distell too. I must know if it signifies the
      trigger, or I&rsquo;m agitated about nothing. Dr. Forbery&rsquo;ll be able to tell how
      far they mean going for a patriotic song.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;For we march in ranks to the laurelled banks,
        On the bright horizon shining,
        Though the fields between run red on the green,
        And many a wife goes pining.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Will you come, Phil?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I &lsquo;m under orders.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t engage yourself by coming.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m in for the pull if I join hands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why not?&mdash;inside the law, of course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;While your Barney skirmishes outside!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And when the poor fellow&rsquo;s cranium&rsquo;s cracking to fling his cap in the
      air, and physician and politician are agreed it&rsquo;s good for him to do it,
      or he&rsquo;ll go mad and be a dangerous lunatic! Phil, it must be a blow now
      and then for these people over here, else there&rsquo;s no teaching their
      imaginations you&rsquo;re in earnest; for they&rsquo;ve got heads that open only to
      hard raps, these English; and where injustice rules, and you&rsquo;d spread a
      light of justice, a certain lot of us must give up the ghost&mdash;naturally
      on both sides. Law&rsquo;s law, and life&rsquo;s life, so long as you admit that the
      law is bad; and in that case, it&rsquo;s big misery and chronic disease to let
      it be and at worst a jump and tumble into the next world, of a score or
      two of us if we have a wrestle with him. But shake the old villain; hang
      on him and shake him. Bother his wig, if he calls himself Law. That &lsquo;s how
      we dust the corruption out of him for a bite or two in return. Such is
      humanity, Phil: and you must allow for the roundabout way of moving to get
      into the straight road at last. And I see what you&rsquo;re for saying: a
      roundabout eye won&rsquo;t find it! You&rsquo;re wrong where there are dozens of
      corners. Logic like yours, my boy, would have you go on picking at the
      Gordian Knot till it became a jackasses&rsquo; race between you and the rope
      which was to fall to pieces last.&mdash;There &lsquo;s my old girl at the stall,
      poor soul! See her!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip had signalled a cabman to stop. He stood facing his cousin with a
      close-lipped smile that summarised his opinion and made it readable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no time for an introduction to her this morning,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t drop in on Distell to hear the latest brewing? And, by the by,
      Phil, tell us, could you give us a hint for packing five or six hundred
      rifles and a couple of pieces of cannon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip stared; he bent a lowering frown on his cousin, with a twitch at
      his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! easy!&rsquo; Con answered the look; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s for another place and harder to
      get at.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was eyed suspiciously and he vowed the military weapons were for
      another destination entirely, the opposite Pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, you wouldn&rsquo;t be in for a crazy villainy like that!&rsquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, nor wink to it,&rsquo; said Con. &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s a question about packing cannon
      and small arms; and you might be useful in dropping a hint or two. The
      matter&rsquo;s innocent. It&rsquo;s not even a substitution of one form of Government
      for another: only a change of despots, I suspect. And here&rsquo;s Mr. John
      Mattock himself, who&rsquo;ll corroborate me, as far as we can let you into the
      secret before we&rsquo;ve consulted together. And he&rsquo;s an Englishman and a
      member of Parliament, and a Liberal though a landlord, a thorough stout
      Briton and bulldog for the national integrity, not likely to play at arms
      and ammunition where his country&rsquo;s prosperity &lsquo;s concerned. How d&rsquo; ye do,
      Mr. Mattock&mdash;and opportunely, since it&rsquo;s my cousin, Captain Philip
      O&rsquo;Donnell, aide-de-camp to Sir Charles, fresh from Canada, of whom you&rsquo;ve
      heard, I&rsquo;d like to make you acquainted with, previous to your meeting at
      my wife&rsquo;s table tomorrow evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip bowed to a man whose notion of the ceremony was to nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Con took him two steps aside and did all the talking. Mr. Mattock listened
      attentively the first half-minute, after which it could be perceived that
      the orator was besieging a post, or in other words a Saxon&rsquo;s mind made up
      on a point of common sense. His appearance was redolently marine; his
      pilot coat, flying necktie and wideish trowsers, a general airiness of
      style on a solid frame, spoke of the element his blue eyes had dipped
      their fancy in, from hereditary inclination. The colour of a sandpit was
      given him by hair and whiskers of yellow-red on a ruddy face. No one could
      express a negative more emphatically without wording it, though he neither
      frowned nor gesticulated to that effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Con, abruptly coming to an end after an eloquent appeal. &lsquo;And I
      think I&rsquo;m of your opinion: and the sea no longer dashes at the rock, but
      makes itself a mirror to the same. She&rsquo;ll keep her money and nurse her
      babe, and not be trying risky adventures to turn him into a reigning
      prince. Only this: you&rsquo;ll have to persuade her the thing is impossible.
      She&rsquo;ll not take it from any of us. She looks on you as Wisdom in the
      uniform of a great commander, and if you say a thing can be done it &lsquo;s
      done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The reverse too, I hope,&rsquo; said Mr. Mattock, nodding and passing on his
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I am not so sure of,&rsquo; Con remarked to himself. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a change in
      a man through a change in his position! Six months or so back, Phil, that
      man came from Vienna, the devoted slave of the Princess Nikolas. He&rsquo;d been
      there on his father&rsquo;s business about one of the Danube railways, and he
      was ready to fill the place of the prince at the head of his phantom body
      of horse and foot and elsewhere. We talked of his selling her estates for
      the purchase of arms and the enemy&mdash;as many as she had money for. We
      discussed it as a matter of business. She had bewitched him: and would
      again, I don&rsquo;t doubt, if she were here to repeat the dose. But in the
      interim his father dies, he inherits; and he enters Parliament, and now,
      mind you, the man who solemnly calculated her chances and speculates on
      the transmission of rifled arms of the best manufacture and latest
      invention by his yacht and with his loads of rails, under the noses of the
      authorities, like a master rebel, and a chivalrous gentleman to boot, pooh
      poohs the whole affair. You saw him. Grave as an owl, the dead contrary of
      his former self!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought I heard you approve him,&rsquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I do. But the poor girl has ordered her estates to be sold to cast
      the die, and I &lsquo;m taking the view of her disappointment, for she believes
      he can do anything; and if I know the witch, her sole comfort lying in the
      straw is the prospect of a bloody venture for a throne. The truth is, to
      my thinking, it&rsquo;s the only thing she has to help her to stomach her
      husband.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s rank idiocy to suppose she can smuggle cannon!&rsquo; cried Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But that man Mattock&rsquo;s not an idiot and he thought she could. And it &lsquo;s
      proof he was under a spell. She can work one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The country hasn&rsquo;t a port.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Round the Euxine and up the Danube, with the British flag at the stern. I
      could rather enjoy the adventure. And her prince is called for. He&rsquo;s
      promised a good reception when he drops down the river, they say. A bit of
      a scrimmage on the landing-pier may be, and the first field or two, and
      then he sits himself, and he waits his turn. The people change their
      sovereigns as rapidly as a London purse. Two pieces of artillery and two
      or three hundred men and a trumpet alter the face of the land there.
      Sometimes a trumpet blown by impudence does it alone. They&rsquo;re enthusiastic
      for any new prince. He&rsquo;s their Weekly Journal or Monthly Magazine. Let
      them make acquaintance with Adiante Adister, I&rsquo;d not swear she wouldn&rsquo;t
      lay fast hold of them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip signalled to his driver, and Captain Con sang out his dinner-hour
      for a reminder to punctuality, thoughtful of the feelings of his wife.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. MISS MATTOCK
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Adister O&rsquo;Donnell, in common with her family, had an extreme dislike
      of the task of composing epistles, due to the circumstance that she was
      unable, unaided, to conceive an idea disconnected with the main theme of
      her communication, and regarded, as an art of conjuring, the use of words
      independent of ideas. Her native superiority caused her to despise the
      art, but the necessity for employing it at intervals subjected her to fits
      of admiration of the conjurer, it being then evident that a serviceable
      piece of work, beyond her capacity to do, was lightly performed by
      another. The lady&rsquo;s practical intelligence admitted the service, and at
      the same time her addiction to the practical provoked disdain of so flimsy
      a genius, which was identified by her with the genius of the Irish race.
      If Irishmen had not been notoriously fighters, famous for their chivalry,
      she would have looked on them as a kind of footmen hired to talk and
      write, whose volubility might be encouraged and their affectionateness
      deserved by liberal wages. The promptitude of Irish blood to deliver the
      war-cry either upon a glove flung down or taken up, raised them to a first
      place in her esteem: and she was a peaceful woman abhorring sanguinary
      contention; but it was in her own blood to love such a disposition against
      her principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      She led Patrick to her private room, where they both took seats and he
      selected a pen. Mr. Patrick supposed that his business would be to listen
      and put her words to paper; a mechanical occupation permitting the
      indulgence of personal phantasies; and he was flying high on them until
      the extraordinary delicacy of the mind seeking to deliver itself forced
      him to prick up all his apprehensiveness. She wished to convey that she
      was pleased with the news from Vienna, and desired her gratification to be
      imparted to her niece Caroline, yet not so as to be opposed to the
      peculiar feelings of her brother Edward, which had her fullest sympathy;
      and yet Caroline must by no means be requested to alter a sentence
      referring to Adiante, for that would commit her and the writer jointly to
      an insincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must be the whole truth, madam,&rsquo; said Patrick, and he wrote: &lsquo;My dear
      Caroline,&rsquo; to get the start. At once a magnificently clear course for the
      complicated letter was distinguished by him. &lsquo;Can I write on and read it
      to you afterward? I have the view,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Adister waved to him to write on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick followed his &lsquo;My dear Caroline&rsquo; with greetings very warm, founded
      on a report of her flourishing good looks. The decision of Government to
      send reinforcements to Ireland was mentioned as a prelude to the
      information from Vienna of the birth of a son to the Princess Nikolas: and
      then; having conjoined the two entirely heterogeneous pieces of
      intelligence, the composer adroitly interfused them by a careless
      transposition of the prelude and the burden that enabled him to play ad
      libitum on regrets and rejoicings; by which device the lord of Earlsfont
      might be offered condolences while the lady could express her strong
      contentment, inasmuch as he deplored the state of affairs in the sister
      island, and she was glad of a crisis concluding a term of suspense thus
      the foreign-born baby was denounced and welcomed, the circumstances
      lamented and the mother congratulated, in a breath, all under cover of the
      happiest misunderstanding, as effective as the cabalism of Prospero&rsquo;s wand
      among the Neapolitan mariners, by the skilful Irish development on a grand
      scale of the rhetorical figure anastrophe, or a turning about and about.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read it out to her, enjoying his composition and pleased with his
      reconcilement of differences. &lsquo;So you say what you feel yourself, madam,
      and allow for the feelings on the other side,&rsquo; he remarked. &lsquo;Shall I fold
      it?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a smoothness in the letter particularly agreeable to her
      troubled wits, but with an awful taste. She hesitated to assent: it seemed
      like a drug that she was offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick sketched a series of hooked noses on the blotter. He heard a
      lady&rsquo;s name announced at the door, and glancing up from his work he beheld
      a fiery vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Adister addressed her affectionately: &lsquo;My dear Jane!&rsquo; Patrick was
      introduced to Miss Mattock.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first impression was that the young lady could wrestle with him and
      render it doubtful of his keeping his legs. He was next engaged in
      imagining that she would certainly burn and be a light in the dark.
      Afterwards he discovered her feelings to be delicate, her looks pleasant.
      Thereupon came one of the most singular sensations he had ever known: he
      felt that he was unable to see the way to please her. She confirmed it by
      her remarks and manner of speaking. Apparently she was conducting a
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re right, my dear Mrs. Adister, I&rsquo;m on my way to the Laundry, and I
      called to get Captain Con to drive there with me and worry the manageress
      about the linen they turn out: for gentlemen are complaining of their
      shirt-fronts, and if we get a bad name with them it will ruin us. Women
      will listen to a man. I hear he has gone down to the city. I must go and
      do it alone. Our accounts are flourishing, I&rsquo;m glad to say, though we
      cannot yet afford to pay for a secretary, and we want one. John and I
      verified them last night. We&rsquo;re aiming at steam, you know. In three or
      four years we may found a steam laundry on our accumulated capital. If
      only we can establish it on a scale to let us give employment to at least
      as many women as we have working now! That is what I want to hear of. But
      if we wait for a great rival steam laundry to start ahead of us, we shall
      be beaten and have to depend on the charitable sentiments of rich people
      to support the Institution. And that won&rsquo;t do. So it&rsquo;s a serious question
      with us to think of taking the initiative: for steam must come. It &lsquo;s a
      scandal every day that it doesn&rsquo;t while we have coal. I&rsquo;m for grand
      measures. At the same time we must not be imprudent: turning off hands,
      even temporarily, that have to feed infants, would be quite against my
      policy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her age struck Patrick as being about twenty-three.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Could my nephew Arthur be of any use to you?&rsquo; said Mrs. Adister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Colonel Adister?&rsquo; Miss Mattock shook her head. &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arthur can be very energetic when he takes up a thing.&rsquo; &lsquo;Can he? But,
      Mrs. Adister, you are looking a little troubled. Sometimes you confide in
      me. You are so good to us with your subscriptions that I always feel in
      your debt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick glanced at his hostess for a signal to rise and depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave none, but at once unfolded her perplexity, and requested Miss
      Mattock to peruse the composition of Mr. Patrick O&rsquo;Donnell and deliver an
      opinion upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady took the letter without noticing its author. She read it
      through, handed it back, and sat with her opinion evidently formed within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think of it?&rsquo; she was asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rank jesuitry,&rsquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feared so!&rsquo; sighed Mrs. Adister. &lsquo;Yet it says everything I wish to have
      said. It spares my brother and it does not belie me. The effect of a
      letter is often most important. I cannot but consider this letter very
      ingenious. But the moment I hear it is jesuitical I forswear it. But then
      my dilemma remains. I cannot consent to give pain to my brother Edward:
      nor will I speak an untruth, though it be to save him from a wound. I am
      indeed troubled. Mr. Patrick, I cannot consent to despatch a jesuitical
      letter. You are sure of your impression, my dear Jane?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perfectly,&rsquo; said Miss Mattock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick leaned to her. &lsquo;But if the idea in the mind of the person supposed
      to be writing the letter is accurately expressed? Does it matter, if we
      call it jesuitical, if the emotion at work behind it happens to be a
      trifle so, according to your definition?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She rejoined: &lsquo;I should say, distinctly it matters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you&rsquo;d not express the emotions at all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He flashed a comical look of astonishment as he spoke. She was not to be
      diverted; she settled into antagonism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should write what I felt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it might be like discharging a bullet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If your writing in that way wounded the receiver.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I should endeavour not to wound!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And there the bit of jesuitry begins. And it&rsquo;s innocent while it &lsquo;s no
      worse than an effort to do a disagreeable thing as delicately as you can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged as delicately as she could:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We cannot possibly please everybody in life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No: only we may spare them a shock: mayn&rsquo;t we?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sophistries of any description, I detest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But sometimes you smile to please, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you detect falseness in that?&rsquo; she answered, after the demurest of
      pauses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No: but isn&rsquo;t there a soupcon of sophistry in it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should say that it comes under the title of common civility.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And on occasion a little extra civility is permitted!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps: when we are not seeking a personal advantage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On behalf of the Steam Laundry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mattock grew restless: she was too serious in defending her position
      to submit to laugh, and his goodhumoured face forbade her taking offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, perhaps, for that is in the interest of others.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the interests of poor and helpless females. And I agree with you with
      all my heart. But you would not be so considerate for the sore feelings of
      a father hearing what he hates to hear as to write a roundabout word to
      soften bad news to him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She sought refuge in the reply that nothing excused jesuitry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Except the necessities of civilisation,&rsquo; said Patrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Politeness is one thing,&rsquo; she remarked pointedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And domestic politeness is quite as needful as popular, you&rsquo;ll admit. And
      what more have we done in the letter than to be guilty of that? And people
      declare it&rsquo;s rarer: as if we were to be shut up in families to tread on
      one another&rsquo;s corns! Dear me! and after a time we should be having rank
      jesuitry advertised as the specific balsam for an unhappy domesticated
      population treading with hard heels from desperate habit and not the
      slightest intention to wound.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Jane,&rsquo; Mrs. Adister interposed while the young lady sat between
      mildly staring and blinking, &lsquo;you have, though still of a tender age, so
      excellent a head that I could trust to your counsel blindfolded. It is
      really deep concern for my brother. I am also strongly in sympathy with my
      niece, the princess, that beautiful Adiante: and my conscience declines to
      let me say that I am not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We might perhaps presume to beg for Miss Mattock&rsquo;s assistance in the
      composition of a second letter more to her taste,&rsquo; Patrick said slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect was prompt: she sprang from her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Mrs. Adister! I leave it to you. I am certain you and Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell
      know best. It&rsquo;s too difficult and delicate for me. I am horribly blunt.
      Forgive me if I seemed to pretend to casuistry. I am sure I had no such
      meaning. I said what I thought. I always do. I never meant that it was not
      a very clever letter; and if it does exactly what you require it should be
      satisfactory. To-morrow evening John and I dine with you, and I look
      forward to plenty of controversy and amusement. At present I have only a
      head for work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I had that,&rsquo; said Patrick devoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dropped her eyes on him, but without letting him perceive that he was
      a step nearer to the point of pleasing her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. THE DINNER-PARTY
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Miss Mattock ventured on a prediction in her mind:
    </h3>
    <p>
      She was sure the letter would go. And there was not much to signify if it
      did. But the curious fatality that a person of such a native uprightness
      as Mrs. Adister should have been drawn in among Irishmen, set her thoughts
      upon the composer of the letter, and upon the contrast of his ingenuous
      look with the powerful cast of his head. She fancied a certain danger
      about him; of what kind she could not quite distinguish, for it had no
      reference to woman&rsquo;s heart, and he was too young to be much of a
      politician, and he was not in the priesthood. His transparency was of a
      totally different order from Captain Con&rsquo;s, which proclaimed itself
      genuine by the inability to conceal a shoal of subterfuges. The younger
      cousin&rsquo;s features carried a something invisible behind them, and she was
      just perceptive enough to spy it, and it excited her suspicions. Irishmen
      both she and her brother had to learn to like, owing to their bad repute
      for stability: they are, moreover, Papists: they are not given to ideas:
      that one of the working for the future has not struck them. In fine, they
      are not solid, not law-supporting, not disposed to be (humbly be it said)
      beneficent, like the good English. These were her views, and as she held
      it a weakness to have to confess that Irishmen are socially more
      fascinating than the good English, she was on her guard against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the letter had gone. She heard of it before the commencement of
      the dinner, after Mrs. Adister had introduced Captain Philip O&rsquo;Donnell to
      her, and while she was exchanging a word or two with Colonel Adister, who
      stood ready to conduct her to the table. If he addressed any remarks to
      the lady under his charge, Miss Mattock did not hear him; and she listened&mdash;who
      shall say why? His unlike likeness to his brother had struck her. Patrick
      opposite was flowing in speech. But Captain Philip O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s taciturnity
      seemed no uncivil gloom: it wore nothing of that look of being beneath the
      table, which some of our good English are guilty of at their social
      festivities, or of towering aloof a Matterhorn above it, in the style of
      Colonel Adister. Her discourse with the latter amused her passing
      reflections. They started a subject, and he punctuated her observations,
      or she his, and so they speedily ran to earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;you were in Egypt this time last winter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He supplies her with a comma: &lsquo;Rather later.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he carries on the line. &lsquo;Dull enough, if you don&rsquo;t have the right
      sort of travelling crew in your boat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Naturally,&rsquo; she puts her semicolon, ominous of the full stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fancy you have never been in Egypt?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There it is; for the tone betrays no curiosity about Egypt and her Nile,
      and he is led to suppose that she has a distaste for foreign places.
    </p>
    <p>
      Condescending to attempt to please, which he has reason to wish to succeed
      in doing, the task of pursuing conversational intercourse devolves upon
      him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I missed Parlatti last spring. What opinion have you formed of her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know her only by name at present.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, I fancy you are indifferent to Opera.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all; I enjoy it. I was as busy then as I am now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Meetings? Dorcas, so forth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not Dorcas, I assure you. You might join if you would.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your most obliged.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A period perfectly rounded. At the same time Miss Mattock exchanged a
      smile with her hostess, of whose benignant designs in handing her to the
      entertaining officer she was not conscious. She felt bound to look happy
      to gratify an excellent lady presiding over the duller half of a table of
      eighteen. She turned slightly to Captain O&rsquo;Donnell. He had committed
      himself to speech at last, without tilting his shoulders to exclude the
      company by devoting himself to his partner, and as he faced the table Miss
      Mattock&rsquo;s inclination to listen attracted him. He cast his eyes on her: a
      quiet look, neither languid nor frigid seeming to her both open and
      uninviting. She had the oddest little shiver, due to she knew not what. A
      scrutiny she could have borne, and she might have read a signification;
      but the look of those mild clear eyes which appeared to say nothing save
      that there was fire behind them, hit on some perplexity, or created it;
      for she was aware of his unhappy passion for the beautiful Miss Adister;
      the whole story had been poured into her ears; she had been moved by it.
      Possibly she had expected the eyes of such a lover to betray melancholy,
      and his power of containing the expression where the sentiment is imagined
      to be most transparent may have surprised her, thrilling her as melancholy
      orbs would not have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Con could have thumped his platter with vexation. His wife&rsquo;s
      diplomacy in giving the heiress to Colonel Adister for the evening had
      received his cordial support while he manoeuvred cleverly to place Philip
      on the other side of her; and now not a step did the senseless fellow
      take, though she offered him his chance, dead sick of her man on the
      right; not a word did he have in ordinary civility; he was a burning
      disgrace to the chivalry of Erin. She would certainly be snapped up by a
      man merely yawning to take the bite. And there&rsquo;s another opportunity gone
      for the old country!&mdash;one&rsquo;s family to boot!
    </p>
    <p>
      Those two were in the middle of the table, and it is beyond mortal, beyond
      Irish, capacity, from one end of a table of eighteen to whip up the whole
      body of them into a lively unanimous froth, like a dish of cream fetched
      out of thickness to the airiest lightness. Politics, in the form of a
      firebrand or apple of Discord, might knead them together and cut them in
      batches, only he had pledged his word to his wife to shun politics as the
      plague, considering Mr. Mattock&rsquo;s presence. And yet it was tempting: the
      recent Irish news had stung him; he could say sharp things from the heart,
      give neat thrusts; and they were fairly divided and well matched. There
      was himself, a giant; and there was an unrecognised bard of his country,
      no other than himself too; and there was a profound politician, profoundly
      hidden at present, like powder in a mine&mdash;the same person. And
      opposite to him was Mr. John Mattock, a worthy antagonist, delightful to
      rouse, for he carried big guns and took the noise of them for the
      shattering of the enemy, and this champion could be pricked on to a point
      of assertion sure to fire the phlegm in Philip; and then young Patrick
      might be trusted to warm to the work. Three heroes out skirmishing on our
      side. Then it begins to grow hot, and seeing them at it in earnest,
      Forbery glows and couches his gun, the heaviest weight of the Irish light
      brigade. Gallant deeds! and now Mr. Marbury Dyke opens on Forbery&rsquo;s flank
      to support Mattock hardpressed, and this artillery of English Rockney
      resounds, with a similar object: the ladies to look on and award the crown
      of victory, Saxon though they be, excepting Rockney&rsquo;s wife, a sure
      deserter to the camp of the brave, should fortune frown on them, for a
      punishment to Rockney for his carrying off to himself a flower of the
      Green Island and holding inveterate against her native land in his black
      ingratitude. Oh! but eloquence upon a good cause will win you the hearts
      of all women, Saxon or other, never doubt of it. And Jane Mattock there,
      imbibing forced doses of Arthur Adister, will find her patriotism
      dissolving in the natural human current; and she and Philip have a pretty
      wrangle, and like one another none the worse for not agreeing:
      patriotically speaking, she&rsquo;s really unrooted by that half-thawed colonel,
      a creature snow-bound up to his chin; and already she&rsquo;s leaping to be
      transplanted. Jane is one of the first to give her vote for the Irish
      party, in spite of her love for her brother John: in common justice, she
      says, and because she hopes for complete union between the two islands.
      And thereupon we debate upon union. On the whole, yes: union, on the
      understanding that we have justice, before you think of setting to work to
      sow the land with affection:&mdash;and that &lsquo;s a crop in a clear soil will
      spring up harvest-thick in a single summer night across St. George&rsquo;s
      Channel, ladies!...
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed a goodly vision of strife and peace: but, politics forbidden, it
      was entirely a dream, seeing that politics alone, and a vast amount of
      blowing even on the topic of politics, will stir these English to enter
      the arena and try a fall. You cannot, until you say ten times more than
      you began by meaning, and have heated yourself to fancy you mean more
      still, get them into any state of fluency at all. Forbery&rsquo;s anecdote now
      and then serves its turn, but these English won&rsquo;t take it up as a start
      for fresh pastures; they lend their ears and laugh a finale to it; you see
      them dwelling on the relish, chewing the cud, by way of mental note for
      their friends to-morrow, as if they were kettles come here merely for
      boiling purposes, to make tea elsewhere, and putting a damper on the fire
      that does the business for them. They laugh, but they laugh
      extinguishingly, and not a bit to spread a general conflagration and
      illumination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case appeared hopeless to Captain Con, bearing an eye on Philip. He
      surveyed his inanimate eights right and left, and folded his combative
      ardour around him, as the soldier&rsquo;s martial cloak when he takes his rest
      on the field. Mrs. Marbury Dyke, the lady under his wing, honoured wife of
      the chairman of his imagined that a sigh escaped him, and said in
      sympathy: &lsquo;Is the bad news from India confirmed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He feared it was not bright, and called to Philip for the latest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing that you have not had already in the newspapers,&rsquo; Philip replied,
      distinctly from afar, but very bluntly, as through a trumpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mattock was attentive. She had a look as good as handsome when she
      kindled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain persevered to draw his cousin out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your chief has his orders?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a rumour to that effect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fellow&rsquo;s training for diplomacy,&rsquo; Con groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip spoke to Miss Mattock: he was questioned and he answered, and
      answered dead as a newspaper telegraphic paragraph, presenting simply the
      corpse of the fact, and there an end. He was a rival of Arthur Adister for
      military brevity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your nephew is quite the diplomatist,&rsquo; said Mrs. Dyke, admiring Philip&rsquo;s
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cousin, ma&rsquo;am. Nephews I might drive to any market to make the most of
      them. Cousins pretend they&rsquo;re better than pigs, and diverge bounding from
      the road at the hint of the stick. You can&rsquo;t get them to grunt more than
      is exactly agreeable to them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My belief is that if our cause is just our flag will triumph,&rsquo; Miss Grace
      Barrow, Jane Mattock&rsquo;s fellow-worker and particular friend, observed to
      Dr. Forbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may be enjoying an original blessing that we in Ireland missed in the
      cradle,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She emphasised: &lsquo;I speak of the just cause; it must succeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The stainless flag&rsquo;ll be in the ascendant in the long run,&rsquo; he assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it the flag of Great Britain you&rsquo;re speaking of, Forbery?&rsquo; the captain
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a harp or two in it,&rsquo; he responded pacifically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dyke was not pleased with the tone. &lsquo;And never will be out of it!&rsquo; 
      she thumped her interjection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or where &lsquo;s your music?&rsquo; said the captain, twinkling for an adversary
      among the males, too distant or too dull to distinguish a note of
      challenge. &lsquo;You&rsquo;d be having to mount your drum and fife in their places,
      ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw no fear of the necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the fife&rsquo;s a pretty instrument,&rsquo; he suggested, and with a candour
      that seduced the unwary lady to think dubiously whether she quite liked
      the fife. Miss Barrow pronounced it cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, and martial!&rsquo; he exclaimed, happy to have caught Rockney&rsquo;s deliberate
      gaze. &lsquo;The effect of it, I&rsquo;m told in the provinces is astonishing for
      promoting enlistment. Hear it any morning in your London parks, at the
      head of a marching regiment of your giant foot-Guards. Three bangs of the
      drum, like the famous mountain, and the fife announces himself to be born,
      and they follow him, left leg and right leg and bearskin. And what if he&rsquo;s
      a small one and a trifle squeaky; so &lsquo;s a prince when the attendant
      dignitaries receive him submissively and hear him informing the nation of
      his advent. It &lsquo;s the idea that &lsquo;s grand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The idea is everything in military affairs,&rsquo; a solemn dupe, a Mr.
      Rumford, partly bald, of benevolent aspect, and looking more copious than
      his flow, observed to the lady beside him. &lsquo;The flag is only an idea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She protested against the barbarism of war, and he agreed with her, but
      thought it must be: it had always been: he deplored the fatality.
      Nevertheless, he esteemed our soldiers, our sailors too. A city man
      himself and a man of peace, he cordially esteemed and hailed the victories
      of a military body whose idea was Duty instead of Ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One thing,&rsquo; said Mrs. Dyke, evading the ambiguous fife, &lsquo;patriotic as I
      am, I hope, one thing I confess; I never have yet brought myself to
      venerate thoroughly our Royal Standard. I dare say it is because I do not
      understand it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A strong fraternal impulse moved Mr. Rumford to lean forward and show her
      the face of one who had long been harassed by the same incapacity to
      digest that one thing. He guessed it at once, without a doubt of the
      accuracy of the shot. Ever since he was a child the difficulty had haunted
      him; and as no one hitherto had even comprehended his dilemma, he beamed
      like a man preparing to embrace a recovered sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Unicorn!&rsquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the Unicorn!&rsquo; she sighed. &lsquo;The Lion is noble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Unicorn, if I may speak by my own feelings, certainly does not
      inspire attachment, that is to say, the sense of devotion, which we should
      always be led to see in national symbols,&rsquo; Mr. Rumford resumed, and he
      looked humorously rueful while speaking with some earnestness; to show
      that he knew the subject to be of the minor sort, though it was not enough
      to trip and jar a loyal enthusiasm in the strictly meditative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Saxon should carry his White Horse, I suppose,&rsquo; Dr. Forbery said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how do we account for the horn on his forehead?&rsquo; Mr. Rumford sadly
      queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Two would have been better for the harmony of the Unicorn&rsquo;s appearance,&rsquo; 
      Captain Con remarked, desirous to play a floundering fish, and tender to
      the known simple goodness of the ingenuous man. &lsquo;What do you say, Forbery?
      The poor brute had a fall on his pate and his horn grew of it, and it &lsquo;s
      to prove that he has got something in his head, and is dangerous both fore
      and aft, which is not the case with other horses, who&rsquo;re usually wicked at
      the heels alone. That&rsquo;s it, be sure, or near it. And his horn&rsquo;s there to
      file the subject nation&rsquo;s grievances for the Lion to peruse at his
      leisure. And his colour&rsquo;s prophetic of the Horse to come, that rides over
      all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lion and Unicorn signify the conquest of the two hemispheres, Matter and
      Mind,&rsquo; said Dr. Forbery. &lsquo;The Lion there&rsquo;s no mistake about. The Unicorn
      sets you thinking. So it&rsquo;s a splendid Standard, and means the more for not
      being perfectly intelligible at a glance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if the Lion, as they&rsquo;ve whispered of late, Forbery, happens to be
      stuffed with straw or with what&rsquo;s worse, with sawdust, a fellow bearing a
      pointed horn at close quarters might do him mortal harm; and it must be a
      situation trying to the patience of them both. The Lion seems to say &ldquo;No
      prancing!&rdquo; as if he knew his peril; and the Unicorn to threaten a playful
      dig at his flank, as if he understood where he&rsquo;s ticklish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rumford drank some champagne and murmured with a shrug to the
      acquiescent lady beside him: &lsquo;Irishmen!&rsquo; implying that the race could not
      be brought to treat serious themes as befitted the seriousness of the
      sentiments they stir in their bosoms. He was personally a little hurt,
      having unfolded a shy secret of his feelings, which were keenly patriotic
      in a phlegmatic frame, and he retired within himself, assuring the lady
      that he accepted our standard in its integrity; his objection was not
      really an objection; it was, he explained to her, a ridiculous desire to
      have a perfect comprehension of the idea in the symbol. But where there
      was no seriousness everything was made absurd. He could, he said, laugh as
      well as others on the proper occasion. As for the Lion being stuffed, he
      warned England&rsquo;s enemies for their own sakes not to be deluded by any such
      patent calumny. The strong can afford to be magnanimous and forbearing.
      Only let not that be mistaken for weakness. A wag of his tail would
      suffice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady agreed. But women are volatile. She was the next moment laughing
      at something she had heard with the largest part of her ear, and she
      thought the worthy gentleman too simple, though she knew him for one who
      had amassed wealth. Captain Con and Dr. Forbery had driven the Unicorn to
      shelter, and were now baiting the Lion. The tremendous import of that wag
      of his tail among the nations was burlesqued by them, and it came into
      collision with Mr. Rumford&rsquo;s legendary forefinger threat. She excused
      herself for laughing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are so preposterous!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, I can laugh,&rsquo; said he, soberly performing the act: and Mr.
      Rumford covered the wound his delicate sensations had experienced under an
      apology for Captain Con, that would redound to the credit of his
      artfulness were it not notorious our sensations are the creatures and born
      doctors of art in discovering unguents for healing their bruises.
      &lsquo;O&rsquo;Donnell has a shrewd head for business. He is sound at heart. There is
      not a drop of gout in his wine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady laughed again, as we do when we are fairly swung by the tide, and
      underneath her convulsion she quietly mused on the preference she would
      give to the simple English citizen for soundness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What can they be discussing down there?&rsquo; Miss Mattock said to Philip,
      enviously as poor Londoners in November when they receive letters from the
      sapphire Riviera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will venture to guess at nonsense,&rsquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing political, then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That scarcely follows; but a host at his own table may be trusted to
      shelve politics.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should not object.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To controversy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Temperately conducted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One would go a long way to see the exhibition.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why cannot men be temperate in their political arguments?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The questions raised are too close about the roots of us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That sounds very pessimist.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More duels come from politics than from any other source.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear it is true. Then women might set you an example.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By avoiding it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you have been out of England for some time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been in America.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are not exactly on the pattern of the Americans.&rsquo; Philip hinted a bow.
      He praised the Republican people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but in our own way we are working out our own problems over here,&rsquo; 
      said she. &lsquo;We have infinitely more to contend with: old institutions,
      monstrous prejudices, and a slower-minded people, I dare say: much slower,
      I admit. We are not shining to advantage at present. Still, that is not
      the fault of English women.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are they so spirited?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Spirited was hardly the word Miss Mattock would have chosen to designate
      the spirit in them. She hummed a second or two, deliberating; it flashed
      through her during the pause that he had been guilty of irony, and she
      reddened: and remembering a foregoing strange sensation she reddened more.
      She had been in her girlhood a martyr to this malady of youth; it had tied
      her to the stake and enveloped her in flames for no accountable reason,
      causing her to suffer cruelly and feel humiliated. She knew the pangs of
      it in public, and in private as well. And she had not conquered it yet.
      She was angered to find herself such a merely physical victim of the
      rushing blood: which condition of her senses did not immediately restore
      her natural colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They mean nobly,&rsquo; she said, to fill an extending gap in the conversation
      under a blush; and conscious of an ultra-swollen phrase, she snatched at
      it nervously to correct it: &lsquo;They are becoming alive to the necessity for
      action.&rsquo; But she was talking to a soldier! &lsquo;I mean, their heads are
      opening.&rsquo; It sounded ludicrous. &lsquo;They are educating themselves
      differently.&rsquo; Were they? &lsquo;They wish to take their part in the work of the
      world.&rsquo; That was nearer the proper tone, though it had a ring of claptrap
      rhetoric hateful to her: she had read it and shrunk from it in reports of
      otherwise laudable meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, spirited, yes. I think they are. I believe they are. One has need
      to hope so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip offered a polite affirmative, evidently formal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a sign had he shown of noticing her state of scarlet. His grave liquid
      eyes were unalterable. She might have been grateful, but the reflection
      that she had made a step to unlock the antechamber of her dearest deepest
      matters to an ordinary military officer, whose notions of women were
      probably those of his professional brethren, impelled her to transfer his
      polished decorousness to the burden of his masculine antagonism-plainly
      visible. She brought the dialogue to a close. Colonel Adister sidled an
      eye at a three-quarter view of her face. &lsquo;I fancy you&rsquo;re feeling the heat
      of the room,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane acknowledged a sensibility to some degree of warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel was her devoted squire on the instant for any practical
      service. His appeal to his aunt concerning one of the windows was answered
      by her appeal to Jane&rsquo;s countenance for a disposition to rise and leave
      the gentlemen. Captain Con, holding the door for the passage of his wife
      and her train of ladies, received the injunction:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ten,&rsquo; from her, and remarked: &lsquo;Minutes,&rsquo; as he shut it. The shortness of
      the period of grace proposed dejection to him on the one hand, and on the
      other a stimulated activity to squeeze it for its juices without any
      delay. Winding past Dr. Forbery to the vacated seat of the hostess he
      frowned forbiddingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s I, is it!&rsquo; cried the doctor. Was it ever he that endangered the
      peace and placability of social gatherings! He sat down prepared rather
      for a bout with Captain Con than with their common opponents,
      notwithstanding that he had accurately read the mock thunder of his brows.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. OF ROCKNEY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Battles have been won and the streams of History diverted to new channels
      in the space of ten minutes. Ladies have been won, a fresh posterity
      founded, and grand financial schemes devised, revolts arranged, a yoke
      shaken off, in less of mortal time. Excepting an inspired Epic song and an
      original Theory of the Heavens, almost anything noteworthy may be
      accomplished while old Father Scythe is taking a trot round a courtyard;
      and those reservations should allow the splendid conception to pass for
      the performance, when we bring to mind that the conception is the
      essential part of it, as a bard poorly known to fame was constantly
      urging. Captain Con had blown his Epic bubbles, not to speak of his
      projected tuneful narrative of the adventures of the great Cuchullin, and
      his Preaching of St. Patrick, and other national triumphs. He could own,
      however, that the world had a right to the inspection of the Epic books
      before it awarded him his crown. The celestial Theory likewise would have
      to be worked out to the last figure by the illustrious astronomers to whom
      he modestly ranked himself second as a benefactor of his kind, revering
      him. So that, whatever we may think in our own hearts, Epic and Theory
      have to remain the exception. Battles indeed have been fought, but when
      you survey the field in preparation for them you are summoned to observe
      the preluding courtesies of civilised warfare in a manner becoming a
      chivalrous gentleman. It never was the merely flinging of your leg across
      a frontier, not even with the abrupt Napoleon. You have besides to drill
      your men; and you have often to rouse your foe with a ringing slap, if
      he&rsquo;s a sleepy one or shamming sleepiness. As here, for example: and that
      of itself devours more minutes than ten. Rockney and Mattock could be
      roused; but these English, slow to kindle, can&rsquo;t subside in a twinkling;
      they are for preaching on when they have once begun; betray the past
      engagement, and the ladies are chilled, and your wife puts you the pungent
      question: &lsquo;Did you avoid politics, Con?&rsquo; in the awful solitude of domestic
      life after a party. Now, if only there had been freedom of discourse
      during the dinner hour, the ten disembarrassed minutes allotted to close
      it would have afforded time sufficient for hearty finishing blows and a
      soothing word or so to dear old innocent Mr. Rumford, and perhaps a kindly
      clap of the shoulder to John Mattock, no bad fellow at bottom. Rockney too
      was no bad fellow in his way. He wanted no more than a beating and a
      thrashing. He was a journalist, a hard-headed rascal, none of your good
      old-fashioned order of regimental scribes who take their cue from their
      colonel, and march this way and that, right about face, with as little
      impediment of principles to hamper their twists and turns as the straw he
      tosses aloft at midnight to spy the drift of the wind to-morrow. Quite the
      contrary; Rockney was his own colonel; he pretended to think
      independently, and tried to be the statesman of a leading article, and
      showed his intention to stem the current of liberty, and was entirely
      deficient in sympathy with the oppressed, a fanatical advocate of force;
      he was an inveterate Saxon, good-hearted and in great need of a drubbing.
      Certain lines Rockney had written of late about Irish affairs recurred to
      Captain Con, and the political fires leaped in him; he sparkled and said:
      &lsquo;Let me beg you to pass the claret over to Mr. Rockney, Mr. Rumford; I
      warrant it for the circulating medium of amity, if he&rsquo;ll try it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo; &lsquo;Tis the Comet Margaux,&rsquo; said Dr. Forbery, topping anything Rockney might
      have had to say, and anything would have served. The latter clasped the
      decanter, poured and drank in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&lsquo;Tis the doctor&rsquo;s antidote, and best for being antedated,&rsquo; Captain Con
      rapped his friend&rsquo;s knuckles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As long as you&rsquo;re contented with not dating in double numbers,&rsquo; retorted
      the doctor, absolutely scattering the precious minutes to the winds, for
      he hated a provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a golden mean, is there!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is; there&rsquo;s a way between magnums of good wine and gout, and it&rsquo;s
      generally discovered too late.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At the physician&rsquo;s door, then! where the golden mean is generally
      discovered to be his fee. I&rsquo;ve heard of poor souls packed off by him
      without an obolus to cross the ferry. Stripped they were in all
      conscience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You remind me of a fellow in Dublin who called on me for medical advice,
      and found he&rsquo;d forgotten his purse. He offered to execute a deed to
      bequeath me his body, naked and not ashamed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;d a right to cut him up at once, Forbery. Any Jury &lsquo;d have pronounced
      him guilty of giving up the ghost before he called.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I let him go, body and all. I never saw him again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fellow was not a lunatic. As for your golden mean, there&rsquo;s a saying:
      Prevention is better than cure: and another that caps it: Drink deep or
      taste not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the Pierian Spring.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what is the wine on my table, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exhaustless if your verses come of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And pure, you may say of the verses and the fount.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And neither heady nor over-composed; with a blush like Diana confessing
      her love for the young shepherd: it&rsquo;s one of your own comparisons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; Con could have roared his own comparisons out of hearing. He was
      angry with Forbery for his obstructive dulness and would not taste the
      sneaking compliment. What could Forbery mean by paying compliments and
      spoiling a game! The ten minutes were dancing away like harmless
      wood-nymphs when the Satyr slumbers. His eyes ranged over his guests
      despondently, and fixed in desperation on Mr. Rumford, whom his
      magnanimous nature would have spared but for the sharp necessity to
      sacrifice him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wine in Rumford at any rate let loose his original nature, if it
      failed to unlock the animal in these other unexcitable Saxons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the way, now I think of it, Mr. Rumford, the interpretation of your
      Royal Standard, which perplexes you so much, strikes me as easy if you &lsquo;ll
      examine the powerfully different colours of the two beasts in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rumford protested that he had abandoned his inquiry: it was a piece of
      foolishness: he had no feeling in it whatever, none.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was a perfect snail&rsquo;s horn for coyness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstances did not permit of his being suffered to slip away: and
      his complexion showed that he might already be classed among the roast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your Lion:&mdash;Mr. Rumford, you should know, is discomposed, as a
      thoughtful patriot, by the inexplicable presence of the Unicorn in the
      Royal Standard, and would be glad to account for his one horn and the
      sickly appearance of the beast. I&rsquo;m prepared to say he&rsquo;s there to
      represent the fair one half of the population.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your Lion, my dear sir, may have nothing in his head, but his tawniness
      tells us he imbibes good sound stuff, worthy of the reputation of a noble
      brewery. Whereas your Unicorn, true to the character of the numberless
      hosts he stands for, is manifestly a consumer of doctor&rsquo;s drugs. And there
      you have the symbolism of your country. Right or left of the shield, I
      forget which, and it is of no importance to the point&mdash;you have
      Grandgosier or Great Turk in all his majesty, mane and tail; and on the
      other hand, you behold, as the showman says, Dyspepsia. And the pair are
      intended to indicate that you may see yourselves complete by looking at
      them separately; and so your Royal Standard is your national mirror; and
      when you gaze on it fondly you&rsquo;re playing the part of a certain Mr.
      Narcissus, who got liker to the Lion than to the Unicorn in the act. Now
      will that satisfy you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite as you please, quite as you please,&rsquo; Mr. Rumford replied. &lsquo;One
      loves the banner of one&rsquo;s country&mdash;that is all.&rsquo; He rubbed his hands.
      &lsquo;I for one am proud of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Far be it from me to blame you, my dear sir. Or there&rsquo;s the alternative
      of taking him to stand for your sole great festival holiday, and
      worshipping him as the personification of your Derbyshire race.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A glittering look was in Captain Con&rsquo;s eye to catch Rockney if he would
      but rise to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That doughty Saxon had been half listening, half chatting to Mr. Mattock,
      and wore on his drawn eyelids and slightly drawn upper lip a look of
      lambent pugnacity awake to the challenge, indifferent to the antagonist,
      and disdainful of the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have too little of your enthusiasm for the flag,&rsquo; Philip said to Mr.
      Rumford to soothe him, in a form of apology for his relative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely no! not in England?&rsquo; said Mr. Rumford, tempted to open his heart,
      for he could be a bellicose gentleman by deputy of the flag. He
      recollected that the speaker was a cousin of Captain Con&rsquo;s, and withdrew
      into his wound for safety. &lsquo;Here and there, perhaps; not when we are
      roused; we want rousing, we greatly prefer to live at peace with the
      world, if the world will let us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at any price?&rsquo; Philip fancied his tone too quakerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed I am not one of that party!&rsquo; said Mr. Rumford, beginning to glow;
      but he feared a snare, and his wound drew him in again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When are you ever at peace!&rsquo; quoth his host, shocked by the inconsiderate
      punctuality of Mrs. Adister O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s household, for here was the coffee
      coming round, and Mattock and Rockney escaping without a scratch. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
      hardly a day in the year when your scarlet mercenaries are not popping at
      niggers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rockney had the flick on the cheek to his manhood now, it might be hoped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our what?&rsquo; asked Mr. Rumford, honestly unable to digest the opprobrious
      term.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Paid soldiery, hirelings, executioners, whom you call volunteers, by a
      charming euphemism, and send abroad to do the work of war while you
      propound the doctrines of peace at home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rockney&rsquo;s forehead was exquisitely eruptive, red and swelling. Mattock
      lurched on his chair. The wine was in them, and the captain commended the
      spiriting of it, as Prospero his Ariel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who should intervene at this instant but the wretched Philip, pricked on
      the point of honour as a soldier! Are we inevitably to be thwarted by our
      own people?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose we all work for pay,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;It seems to me a cry of the
      streets to call us by hard names. The question is what we fight for.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with a witless moderation that was most irritating, considering
      the latest news from the old country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You fight to subjugate, to enslave,&rsquo; said Con, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doing,
      and at the same time your journals are venting their fine irony at the
      Austrians and the Russians and the Prussians for tearing Poland to strips
      with their bloody beaks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We obey our orders, and leave you to settle the political business,&rsquo; 
      Philip replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forbery declined the fray. Patrick was eagerly watchful and dumb. Rockney
      finished his coffee with a rap of the cup in the saucer, an appeal for the
      close of the sitting; and as Dr. Forbery responded to it by pushing back
      his chair, he did likewise, and the other made a movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disappointed hero of a fight unfought had to give the signal for
      rising. Double the number of the ten minutes had elapsed. He sprang up,
      hearing Rockney say: &lsquo;Captain Con O&rsquo;Donnell is a politician or nothing,&rsquo; 
      and as he was the most placable of men concerning his personality, he took
      it lightly, with half a groan that it had not come earlier, and said, &lsquo;He
      thinks and he feels, poor fellow!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      All hope of a general action was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That shall pass for the epitaph of the living,&rsquo; said Rockney.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too late to catch at a trifle to strain it to a tussle. Con was
      obliged to subjoin: &lsquo;Inscribe it on the dungeon-door of tyranny.&rsquo; But the
      note was peaceful.
    </p>
    <p>
      He expressed a wish that the fog had cleared for him to see the stars of
      heaven before he went to bed, informing Mr. Mattock that a long look in
      among them was often his prayer at night, and winter a holy season to him,
      for the reason of its showing them bigger and brighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can tell my wife with a conscience we&rsquo;ve had a quiet evening, and
      you&rsquo;re a witness to it,&rsquo; he said to Patrick. That consolation remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know the secret of your happiness,&rsquo; Patrick answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Know you one of the secrets of a young man&rsquo;s fortune in life, and give us
      a thrilling song at the piano, my son,&rsquo; said Con: &lsquo;though we don&rsquo;t happen
      to have much choice of virgins for ye to-night. Irish or French. Irish are
      popular. They don&rsquo;t mind having us musically. And if we&rsquo;d go on joking to
      the end we should content them, if only by justifying their opinion that
      we&rsquo;re born buffoons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His happy conscience enabled him to court his wife with assiduity and
      winsomeness, and the ladies were once more elated by seeing how
      chivalrously lover-like an Irish gentleman can be after years of wedlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick was asked to sing. Miss Mattock accompanied him at the piano. Then
      he took her place on the music-stool, and she sang, and with an
      electrifying splendour of tone and style.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s the very heart of an Italian you sing with!&rsquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will surprise you perhaps to hear that I prefer German music,&rsquo; said
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But where&mdash;who had the honour of boasting you his pupil?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She mentioned a famous master. Patrick had heard of him in Paris. He
      begged for another song and she complied, accepting the one he selected as
      the favourite of his brother Philip&rsquo;s, though she said: &lsquo;That one?&rsquo; with a
      superior air. It was a mellifluous love-song from a popular Opera somewhat
      out of date. &lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s in Italian!&rsquo; she summed up her impressions of the
      sickly words while scanning them for delivery. She had no great admiration
      of the sentimental Sicilian composer, she confessed, yet she sang as if
      possessed by him. Had she, Patrick thought, been bent upon charming
      Philip, she could not have thrown more fire into the notes. And when she
      had done, after thrilling the room, there was a gesture in her dismissal
      of the leaves displaying critical loftiness. Patrick noticed it and said,
      with the thrill of her voice lingering in him: &lsquo;What is it you do like? I
      should so like to know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was answering when Captain Con came up to the piano and remarked in an
      undertone to Patrick: &lsquo;How is it you hit on the song Adiante Adister used
      to sing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mattock glanced at Philip. He had applauded her mechanically, and it
      was not that circumstance which caused the second rush of scarlet over her
      face. This time she could track it definitely to its origin. A lover&rsquo;s
      favourite song is one that has been sung by his love. She detected herself
      now in the full apprehension of the fact before she had sung a bar: it had
      been a very dim fancy: and she denounced herself guilty of the knowledge
      that she was giving pain by singing the stuff fervidly, in the same breath
      that accused her of never feeling things at the right moment vividly. The
      reminiscences of those pale intuitions made them always affectingly vivid.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what vanity in our emotional state in a great jarring world where we
      are excused for continuing to seek our individual happiness only if we
      ally it and subordinate it to the well being of our fellows! The
      interjection was her customary specific for the cure of these little
      tricks of her blood. Leaving her friend Miss Barrow at the piano, she took
      a chair in a corner and said; &lsquo;Now, Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell, you will hear the music
      that moves me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s not to be singing,&rsquo; said Patrick. &lsquo;And how can you sing so
      gloriously what you don&rsquo;t care for? It puzzles me completely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She assured him she was no enigma: she hushed to him to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped his underlip, keeping on the conversation with his eyes until
      he was caught by the masterly playing of a sonata by the chief of the
      poets of sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was caught by it, but he took the close of the introductory section, an
      allegro con brio, for the end, and she had to hush at him again, and could
      not resist smiling at her lullaby to the prattler. Patrick smiled in
      response. Exchanges of smiles upon an early acquaintance between two young
      people are peeps through the doorway of intimacy. She lost sight of the
      Jesuit. Under the influence of good music, too, a not unfavourable
      inclination towards the person sitting beside us and sharing that
      sweetness, will soften general prejudices&mdash;if he was Irish, he was
      boyishly Irish, not like his inscrutable brother; a better, or hopefuller
      edition of Captain Con; one with whom something could be done to steady
      him, direct him, improve him. He might be taught to appreciate Beethoven
      and work for his fellows. &lsquo;Now does not that touch you more deeply than
      the Italian?&rsquo; said she, delicately mouthing: &lsquo;I, mio tradito amor!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Touch, I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; he was honest enough to reply. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s you that
      haven&rsquo;t given it a fair chance I&rsquo;d like to hear it again. There&rsquo;s a forest
      on fire in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is,&rsquo; she exclaimed. &lsquo;I have often felt it, but never seen it. You
      exactly describe it. How true!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But any music I could listen to all day and all the night,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And be as proud of yourself the next morning?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick was rather at sea. What could she mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Adister O&rsquo;Donnell stepped over to them, with the object of installing
      Colonel Adister in Patrick&rsquo;s place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object was possibly perceived. Mrs. Adister was allowed no time to set
      the manoeuvre in motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell is a great enthusiast for music, and could listen to it all
      day and all night, he tells me,&rsquo; said Miss Mattock. &lsquo;Would he not sicken
      of it in a week, Mrs. Adister?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why should I?&rsquo; cried Patrick. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a gift of heaven.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And, like other gifts of heaven, to the idle it would turn to evil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Work, and you will believe it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Miss Mattock, I want to work; I&rsquo;m empty-handed. It &lsquo;s true I want to
      travel and see a bit of the world to help me in my work by and by. I&rsquo;m
      ready to try anything I can do, though.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has it ever struck you that you might try to help the poor?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arthur is really anxious, and only doubts his ability,&rsquo; said Mrs.
      Adister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The doubt throws a shadow on the wish,&rsquo; said Miss Mattock. &lsquo;And can one
      picture Colonel Adister the secretary of a Laundry Institution, receiving
      directions from Grace and me! We should have to release him long before
      the six months&rsquo; term, when we have resolved to incur the expense of a
      salaried secretary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Adister turned her head to the colonel, who was then looking down the
      features of Mrs. Rockney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m ready, for a year, Miss Mattock.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered him, half jocosely: &lsquo;A whole year of free service? Reflect on
      what you are undertaking.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s writing and accounts, no worse?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Writing and accounts all day, and music in the evening only now and
      then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can do it: I will, if you&rsquo;ll have me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you hear Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell, Mrs. Adister?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Con fluttered up to his wife, and heard the story from Miss
      Mattock.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fancied he saw a thread of good luck for Philip in it. &lsquo;Our house could
      be Patrick&rsquo;s home capitally,&rsquo; he suggested to his wife. She was not a whit
      less hospitable, only hinting that she thought the refusal of the post was
      due to Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if he accepts, imagine him on a stool, my dear madam; he couldn&rsquo;t sit
      it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mattock laughed. &lsquo;No, that is not to be thought of seriously. And
      with Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell it would be probationary for the first fortnight or
      month. Does he know anything about steam?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The rudimentary idea,&rsquo; said Patrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s good for a beginning,&rsquo; said the captain; and he added: &lsquo;Miss
      Mattock, I&rsquo;m proud if one of my family can be reckoned worthy of assisting
      in your noble work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied: &lsquo;I warn everybody that they shall be taken at their word if
      they volunteer their services.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was bidden to know by the captain that the word of an Irish gentleman
      was his bond. &lsquo;And not later than to-morrow evening I&rsquo;ll land him at your
      office. Besides, he&rsquo;ll find countrywomen of his among you, and there&rsquo;s
      that to enliven him. You say they work well, diligently, intelligently.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She deliberated. &lsquo;Yes, on the whole; when they take to their work.
      Intelligently certainly compared with our English. We do not get the best
      of them in London. For that matter, we do not get the best of the English&mdash;not
      the women of the north. We have to put up with the rejected of other and
      better-paying departments of work. It breaks my heart sometimes to see how
      near they are to doing well, but for such a little want of ballast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If they&rsquo;re Irish,&rsquo; said Patrick, excited by the breaking of her heart, &lsquo;a
      whisper of cajolery in season is often the secret.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Con backed him for diplomacy. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll learn he has a head, Miss
      Mattock.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am myself naturally blunt, and prefer the straightforward method,&rsquo; said
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick nodded. &lsquo;But where there&rsquo;s an obstruction in the road, it&rsquo;s
      permissible to turn a corner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take &lsquo;em in flank when you can&rsquo;t break their centre,&rsquo; said Con.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you shall really try whether you can endure the work for a short
      time if you are in earnest,&rsquo; Miss Mattock addressed the volunteer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I am,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are too poor at present to refuse the smallest help.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And mine is about the smallest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not mean that, Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you&rsquo;ll have me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gladly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Con applauded the final words between them. They had the genial
      ring, though she accepted the wrong young man for but a shadow of the
      right sort of engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      This being settled, by the sudden combination of enthusiastic Irish
      impulse and benevolent English scheming, she very considerately resigned
      herself to Mrs. Adister&rsquo;s lead and submitted herself to a further jolting
      in the unprogressive conversational coach with Colonel Adister, whose
      fault as a driver was not in avoiding beaten ways, but whipping wooden
      horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently those two were little adapted to make the journey of life
      together, though they were remarkably fine likenesses of a pair in the
      dead midway of the journey, Captain Con reflected, and he could have
      jumped at the thought of Patrick&rsquo;s cleverness: it was the one bright thing
      of the evening. There was a clear gain in it somewhere. And if there was
      none, Jane Mattock was a good soul worth saving. Why not all the
      benefaction on our side, and a figo for rewards! Devotees or adventurers,
      he was ready in imagination to see his cousins play the part of either, as
      the cross-roads offered, the heavens appeared to decree. We turn to the
      right or the left, and this way we&rsquo;re voluntary drudges, and that way
      we&rsquo;re lucky dogs; it&rsquo;s all according to the turn, the fate of it. But
      never forget that old Ireland is weeping!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        O never forget that old Ireland is weeping
        The bitter salt tears of the mother bereft!
</pre>
    <p>
      He hummed the spontaneous lines. He was accused of singing to himself, and
      a song was vigorously demanded of him by the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; he sighed. &lsquo;I was plucking the drowned body
      of a song out of the waters to give it decent burial. And if I sing I
      shall be charged with casting a firebrand at Mr. Rockney.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rockney assured him that he could listen to anything in verse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Observe the sneer:&mdash;for our verses are smoke,&rsquo; said Con.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mattock pressed him to sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had saddened his mind about old Ireland: the Irish news weighed
      heavily on him, unrelieved by a tussle with Rockney. If he sang, it would
      be an Irish song, and he would break down in it, he said; and he hinted at
      an objection of his wife&rsquo;s to spirited Irish songs of the sort which carry
      the sons of Erin bounding over the fences of tyranny and the brook of
      tears. And perhaps Mr. Rockney might hear a tale in verse as hard to bear
      as he sometimes found Irish prose!&mdash;Miss Mattock perceived that his
      depression was genuine, not less than his desire to please her. &lsquo;Then it
      shall be on another occasion,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! on another occasion I&rsquo;m the lark to the sky, my dear lady.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her carriage was announced. She gave Patrick a look, with a smile, for it
      was to be a curious experiment. He put on the proper gravity of a young
      man commissioned, without a dimple of a smile. Philip bowed to her
      stiffly, as we bow to a commanding officer who has insulted us and will
      hear of it. But for that, Con would have manoeuvred against his wife to
      send him downstairs at the lady&rsquo;s heels. The fellow was a perfect riddle,
      hard to read as the zebra lines on the skin of a wild jackass&mdash;if
      Providence intended any meaning when she traced them! and it&rsquo;s a moot
      point: as it is whether some of our poets have meaning and are not
      composers of zebra. &lsquo;No one knows but them above!&rsquo; he said aloud,
      apparently to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What can you be signifying?&rsquo; she asked him. She had deputed Colonel
      Arthur to conduct Miss Mattock and Miss Barrow to their carriage, and she
      supposed the sentence might have a mysterious reference to the plan she
      had formed; therefore it might be a punishable offence. Her small round
      eyes were wide-open, her head was up and high.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was easily appeased, too easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The question of rain, madam,&rsquo; he replied to her repetition of his words.
      &lsquo;I dare say that was what I had in my mind, hearing Mr. Mattock and Mr.
      Rockney agree to walk in company to their clubs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He proposed to them that they should delay the march on a visit to his
      cabin near the clouds. They were forced to decline his invitation to the
      gentle lion&rsquo;s mouth; as did Mr. Rumford, very briskly and thankfully. Mr.
      Rockney was taken away by Mr. and Mrs. Marbury Dyke. So the party
      separated, and the Englishmen were together, and the Irishmen together;
      and hardly a syllable relating to the Englishmen did the Irishmen say,
      beyond an allusion to an accident to John Mattock&rsquo;s yacht off the Irish
      west-coast last autumn; but the Irishmen were subjected to some remarks by
      the Englishmen, wherein their qualities as individuals and specimens of a
      race were critically and neatly packed. Common sense is necessarily
      critical in its collision with vapours, and the conscious possessors of an
      exclusive common sense are called on to deliver a summary verdict, nor is
      it an unjust one either, if the verdict be taken simply for an estimate of
      what is presented upon the plain surface of to-day. Irishmen are queer
      fellows, never satisfied, thirsting for a shindy. Some of them get along
      pretty well in America. The air of their Ireland intoxicates them. They
      require the strong hand: fair legislation, but no show of weakness. Once
      let them imagine you are afraid of them, and they see perfect independence
      in their grasp. And what would be the spectacle if they were to cut
      themselves loose from England? The big ship might be inconvenienced by the
      loss of the tender; the tender would fall adrift on the Atlantic, with
      pilot and captain at sword and pistol, the crew playing Donnybrook freely.
      Their cooler heads are shrewd enough to see the folly, but it catches the
      Irish fancy to rush to the extreme, and we have allowed it to be supposed
      that it frightens us. There is the capital blunder, fons et origo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their leaders now pretend to work upon the Great Scale; they demand
      everything on the spot upon their own interpretation of equity.
      Concessions, hazy speeches, and the puling nonsense of our present
      Government, have encouraged them so far and got us into the mess. Treat
      them as policemen treat highwaymen: give them the law: and the law must be
      tightened, like the hold on a rogue by his collar, if they kick at it.
      Rockney was for sharp measures in repression, fair legislation in due
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fair legislation upon your own interpretation of fair,&rsquo; said Mattock,
      whose party opposed Rockney&rsquo;s. &lsquo;As to repression, you would have missed
      that instructive scene this evening at Con O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s table, if you had
      done him the kindness to pick up his glove. It &lsquo;s wisest to let them
      exhaust their energies upon one another. Hold off, and they&rsquo;re soon at
      work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What kind of director of a City Company does he make?&rsquo; said Rockney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mattock bethought him that, on the whole, strange to say, Con O&rsquo;Donnell
      comported himself decorously as a director, generally speaking on the
      reasonable side, not without shrewdness: he seemed to be sobered by the
      money question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That wife of his is the salvation of him,&rsquo; Rockney said, to account for
      the Captain&rsquo;s shrewdness. &lsquo;She manages him cleverly. He knows the length
      of his line. She&rsquo;s a woman of principle, and barring the marriage, good
      sense too. His wife keeps him quiet, or we should be hearing of him.
      Forbery &lsquo;s a more dangerous man. There&rsquo;s no intentional mischief in Con
      O&rsquo;Donnell; it&rsquo;s only effervescence. I saw his game, and declined to uncork
      him. He talks of a niece of his wife&rsquo;s: have you ever seen her?&mdash;married
      to some Servian or Roumanian prince.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mattock answered: &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is she such a beauty?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Mattock answered: &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; after affecting thoughtfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They seem to marry oddly in that family.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mattock let fly a short laugh at the remark, which had the ring of some
      current phrase. &lsquo;They do,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Jane Mattock spoke to her brother of her recruit. He entirely
      trusted to her discretion; the idea of a young Irish secretary was rather
      comical, nevertheless. He had his joke about it, requesting to have a
      sight of the secretary&rsquo;s books at the expiry of the week, which was the
      length of time he granted this ardent volunteer for evaporating and
      vanishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it releases poor Grace for a week, it will be useful to us,&rsquo; Jane
      said. &lsquo;Women are educated so shamefully that we have not yet found one we
      can rely on as a competent person. And Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell&mdash;did you notice
      him? I told you I met him a day or two back&mdash;seems willing to be of
      use. It cannot hurt him to try. Grace has too much on her hands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has a dozen persons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are zealous when they are led.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beware of letting them suspect that they are led.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are anxious to help the poor if they can discover how.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good men, I don&rsquo;t doubt,&rsquo; said John Mattock. &lsquo;Any proposals from curates
      recently?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not of late. Captain O&rsquo;Donnell, the brother of our secretary, is
      handsomer, but we do not think him so trustworthy. Did you observe him at
      all?&mdash;he sat by me. He has a conspirator&rsquo;s head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is that?&rsquo; her brother asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only a notion of mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was directed to furnish a compendious report of the sayings, doings,
      and behaviour of the Irish secretary in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I find him there,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother was of opinion that Mr. Patrick O&rsquo;Donnell would be as good as
      his word, and might be expected to appear there while the novelty lasted.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. THE MATTOCK FAMILY
    </h2>
    <p>
      That evening&rsquo;s report of the demeanour of the young Irish secretary in
      harness was not so exhilarating as John Mattock had expected, and he
      inclined to think his sister guilty of casting her protecting veil over
      the youth. It appeared that Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell had been studious of his duties,
      had spoken upon no other topic, had asked pertinent questions, shown no
      flippancy, indulged in no extravagances. He seemed, Jane said, eager to
      master details. A certain eagerness of her own in speaking of it sharpened
      her clear features as if they were cutting through derision. She stated it
      to propitiate her brother, as it might have done but for the veracious
      picture of Patrick in the word &lsquo;eager,&rsquo; which pricked the scepticism of a
      practical man. He locked his mouth, looking at her with a twinkle she
      refused to notice. &lsquo;Determined to master details&rsquo; he could have accepted.
      One may be determined to find a needle in a dust-heap; one does not with
      any stiffness of purpose go at a dust-heap eagerly. Hungry men have eaten
      husks; they have not betrayed eagerness for such dry stuff. Patrick&rsquo;s
      voracity after details exhibited a doubtfully genuine appetite, and John
      deferred his amusement until the termination of the week or month when his
      dear good Jane would visit the office to behold a vacated seat, or be
      assailed by the customary proposal. Irishmen were not likely to be far
      behind curates in besieging an heiress. For that matter, Jane was her own
      mistress and could very well take care of herself; he had confidence in
      her wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was besides of an unsuspicious and an unexacting temperament. The
      things he would strongly object to he did not specify to himself because
      he was untroubled by any forethought of them. Business, political,
      commercial and marine, left few vacancies in his mind other than for the
      pleasures he could command and enjoy. He surveyed his England with a ruddy
      countenance, and saw the country in the reflection. His England saw much
      of itself in him. Behind each there was more, behind the country a great
      deal more, than could be displayed by a glass. The salient features wore a
      resemblance. Prosperity and heartiness; a ready hand on, and over, a full
      purse; a recognised ability of the second-rate order; a stout hold of
      patent principles; inherited and embraced, to make the day secure and
      supply a somniferous pillow for the night; occasional fits of anxiety
      about affairs, followed by an illuminating conviction that the world is a
      changing one and our construction not of granite, nevertheless that a
      justifiable faith in the ship, joined to a constant study of the chart,
      will pull us through, as it has done before, despite all assaults and
      underminings of the common enemy and the particular; these, with the
      humorous indifference of familiarity and constitutional annoyances,
      excepting when they grew acute and called for drugs, and with friendliness
      to the race of man of both colours, in the belief that our Creator
      originally composed in black and white, together with a liking for matters
      on their present footing in slow motion, partly under his conductorship,
      were the prominent characteristics of the grandson of the founder of the
      house, who had built it from a spade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story of the building was notorious; popular books for the inciting of
      young Englishmen to dig to fortune had a place for it among the chapters,
      where we read of the kind of man, and the means by which the country has
      executed its later giant strides of advancement. The first John Mattock
      was a representative of his time; he moved when the country was moving,
      and in the right direction, finding himself at the auspicious moment upon
      a line of rail. Elsewhere he would have moved, we may suppose, for the
      spade-like virtues bear their fruits; persistent and thrifty, solid and
      square, will fetch some sort of yield out of any soil; but he would not
      have gone far. The Lord, to whom an old man of a mind totally Hebrew
      ascribed the plenitude of material success, the Lord and he would have
      reared a garden in the desert; in proximity to an oasis, still on the
      sands, against obstacles. An accumulation of upwards of four hundred
      thousand pounds required, as the moral of the popular books does not
      sufficiently indicate, a moving country, an ardent sphere, to produce the
      sum: and since, where so much was done, we are bound to conceive others at
      work as well as he, it seems to follow that the exemplar outstripping them
      vastly must have profited by situation at the start, which is a lucky
      accident; and an accident is an indigestible lump in a moral tale, real
      though the story be. It was not mentioned in the popular books; nor did
      those worthy guides to the pursuit of wealth contain any reminder of old
      John Mattock&rsquo;s dependence upon the conjoint labour of his fellows to push
      him to his elevation. As little did they think of foretelling a day,
      generations hence, when the empty heirs of his fellows might prefer a
      modest claim (confused in statement) to compensation against the estate he
      bequeathed: for such prophecy as that would have hinted at a tenderness
      for the mass to the detriment of the individual, and such tenderness as
      that is an element of our religion, not the drift of our teaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grumbled at the heavy taxation of his estate during life: yearly this
      oppressed old man paid thousands of pounds to the Government. It was poor
      encouragement to shoulder and elbow your way from a hovel to a mansion!
    </p>
    <p>
      He paid the money, dying sour; a splendid example of energy on the road, a
      forbidding one at the terminus. And here the moral of the popular books
      turned aside from him to snatch at humanity for an instance of our
      frailness and dealt in portentous shadows:&mdash;we are, it should be
      known, not the great creatures we assume ourselves to be. Six months
      before his death he appeared in the garb of a navvy, humbly soliciting
      employment at his own house-door. There he appealed to the white calves of
      his footmen for a day&rsquo;s work, upon the plea that he had never been a
      democrat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene had been described with humanely-moralising pathos in the
      various books of stories of Men who have come to Fortune, and it had for a
      length of seasons an annual position in the foremost rank (on the line,
      facing the door) in our exhibition of the chosen artists, where, as our
      popular words should do, it struck the spectator&rsquo;s eye and his brain
      simultaneously with pugilistic force: a reference to the picture in the
      catalogue furnishing a recapitulation of the incident. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve worked a good
      bit in my time, gentlemen, and I baint done yet&rsquo;:&mdash;SEE PROFESSOR
      SUMMIT&rsquo;S &lsquo;MEN WHO HAVE COME TO FORTUNE.&rsquo; There is, we perceive at a
      glance, a contrast in the bowed master of the Mansion applying to his
      menials for a day&rsquo;s work at the rate of pay to able-bodied men:&mdash;which
      he is not, but the deception is not disingenuous. The contrast flashed
      with the rapid exchange of two prizefighters in a ring, very popularly.
      The fustian suit and string below the knee, on the one side, and the
      purple plush breeches and twinkling airy calves (fascinating his attention
      as he makes his humble request to his own, these domestic knights) to
      right and left of the doorway and in front, hit straight out of the
      canvas. And as quickly as you perceive the contrast you swallow the moral.
      The dreaded thing is down in a trice, to do what salutary work it may
      within you. That it passed into the blood of England&rsquo;s middle-class
      population, and set many heads philosophically shaking, and filled the
      sails of many a sermon, is known to those who lived in days when Art and
      the classes patronising our Native Art existed happily upon the terms of
      venerable School-Dame and studious pupils, before the sickly era
      displacing Exhibitions full of meaning for tricks of colour, monstrous
      atmospherical vagaries that teach nothing, strange experiments on the
      complexion of the human face divine&mdash;the feminine hyper-aethereally.
      Like the first John Mattock, it was formerly of, and yet by dint of sturdy
      energy, above the people. They learnt from it; they flocked to it
      thirsting and retired from it thoughtful, with some belief of having drunk
      of nature in art, as you will see the countless troops of urchins about
      the one cow of London, in the Great City&rsquo;s Green Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bequest to the nation of the best of these pictures of Old John, by a
      very old Yorkshire collector, makes it milk for all time, a perpetual
      contrast, and a rebuke. Compared with the portrait of Jane Mattock in her
      fiery aureole of hair on the walls of the breakfast-room, it marks that
      fatal period of degeneracy for us, which our critics of Literature as well
      as Art are one voice in denouncing, when the complex overwhelms the
      simple, and excess of signification is attempted, instead of letting plain
      nature speak her uncorrupted tongue to the contemplative mind. Degeneracy
      is the critical history of the Arts. Jane&rsquo;s hair was of a reddish
      gold-inwoven cast that would, in her grandfather&rsquo;s epoch, have shone
      unambiguously as carrots. The girl of his day thus adorned by Nature,
      would have been shown wearing her ridiculous crown with some decent
      sulkiness; and we should not have had her so unsparingly crowned; the
      truth would have been told in a dexterous concealment&mdash;a rope of it
      wound up for a bed of the tortoise-shell comb behind, and a pair of tight
      cornucopias at the temples. What does our modern artist do but flare it to
      right and left, lift it wavily over her forehead, revel in the oriental
      superabundance, and really seem to swear we shall admire it, against our
      traditions of the vegetable, as a poetical splendour. The head of the
      heiress is in a Jovian shower. Marigolds are in her hand. The whole square
      of canvas is like a meadow on the borders of June. It causes blinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother also is presented: a fine portrait of him, with clipped red
      locks, in blue array, smiling, wearing the rose of briny breezes, a
      telescope under his left arm, his right forefinger on a map, a view of
      Spitzbergen through a cabin-window: for John had notions about the
      north-west passage, he had spent a winter in the ice, and if an amateur,
      was not the less a true sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his brass-buttoned blue coat, and his high coloured cheeks, and his
      convict hair&mdash;a layer of brickdust&mdash;and his air of princely
      wealth, and the icebergs and hummocks about him, he looks for adventure
      without a thought of his heroism&mdash;the country all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he stands, a lover of the sea, and a scientific seaman and engineer
      to boot, practical in every line of his face, defying mankind to suspect
      that he cherishes a grain of romance. On the wall, just above his
      shoulder, is a sketch of a Viking putting the lighted brand to his ship in
      mid sea, and you are to understand that his time is come and so should a
      Viking die: further, if you will, the subject is a modern Viking, ready
      for the responsibilities of the title. Sketches of our ancient wooden
      walls and our iron and plated defences line the panellings. These
      degenerate artists do work hard for their money.
    </p>
    <p>
      The portrait of John&rsquo;s father, dated a generation back, is just the man
      and little else, phantomly the man. His brown coat struggles out of the
      obscurity of the background, but it is chiefly background clothing him.
      His features are distinguishable and delicate: you would suppose him
      appearing to you under the beams of a common candle, or cottage coalfire&mdash;ferruginously
      opaque. The object of the artist (apart from the triumph of tone on the
      canvas) is to introduce him as an elegant and faded gentleman, rather
      retiring into darkness than emerging. He is the ghost of the painter&rsquo;s
      impasto. Yet this is Ezra Mattock, who multipled the inheritance of the
      hundreds of thousands into millions, and died, after covering Europe,
      Asia, and the Americas with iron rails, one of the few Christians that can
      hold up their heads beside the banking Jew as magnates in the lists of
      gold. The portrait is clearly no frontispiece of his qualities. He married
      an accomplished and charitable lady, and she did not spoil the stock in
      refining it. His life passed quietly; his death shook the country: for
      though it had been known that he had been one of our potentates, how
      mightily he was one had not entered into the calculations of the public
      until the will of the late Ezra Mattock, cited in our prints, received
      comments from various newspaper articles. A chuckle of collateral
      satisfaction ran through the empire. All England and her dependencies felt
      the state of cousinship with the fruits of energy; and it was an agreeable
      sentiment, coming opportunely, as it did, at the tail of articles that had
      been discussing a curious manifestation of late&mdash;to-wit, the
      awakening energy of the foreigner&mdash;a prodigious apparition on our
      horizon. Others were energetic too! We were not, the sermon ran, to
      imagine we were without rivals in the field. We were possessed of certain
      positive advantages; we had coal, iron, and an industrious population, but
      we were, it was to be feared, by no means a thrifty race, and there was
      reason for doubt whether in the matter of industry we were quite up to the
      mark of our forefathers. No deterioration of the stock was apprehended,
      still the nation must be accused of a lack of vigilance. We must look
      round us, and accept the facts as they stood. So accustomed had we become
      to the predominance of our position that it was difficult at first to
      realise a position of rivalry that threatened our manufacturing interests
      in their hitherto undisputed lead in the world&rsquo;s markets. The tale of our
      exports for the last five years conveys at once its moral and its warning.
      Statistics were then cited.
    </p>
    <p>
      As when the gloomy pedagogue has concluded his exhortation, statistics
      birched the land. They were started at our dinner-tables, and scourged the
      social converse. Not less than in the articles, they were perhaps livelier
      than in the preface; they were distressing nevertheless; they led
      invariably to the question of our decadence. Carthage was named; a great
      mercantile community absolutely obliterated! Senatorial men were led to
      propose in their thoughtfullest tones that we should turn our attention to
      Art. Why should we not learn to excel in Art? We excelled in Poetry. Our
      Poets were cited: not that there was a notion that poems would pay as an
      export but to show that if we excel in one of the Arts we may in others of
      them. The poetry was not cited, nor was it necessary, the object being to
      inflate the balloon of paradox with a light-flying gas, and prove a
      poem-producing people to be of their nature born artists; if they did but
      know it. The explosion of a particular trade points to your taking up
      another. Energy is adapted to flourish equally in every branch of labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the genius of the will, commanding all the crossroads. A country
      breeding hugely must prove its energy likewise in the departments of the
      mind, or it will ultimately be unable to feed its young&mdash;nay, to
      feast its aldermen! Let us be up and alive.&mdash;Such was the exhortation
      of a profound depression. Outside these dismal assemblies, in the streets,
      an ancient song of raven recurrence croaked of &lsquo;Old England a-going down
      the hill&rsquo;; for there is a link of electricity between the street-boy and
      the leading article in days when the Poles exchange salutations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ezra&rsquo;s legacy of his millions to son and daughter broke like a golden
      evening on the borders of the raincloud. Things could not be so bad when a
      plain untitled English gentleman bequeathed in the simplest manner
      possible such giant heaps, a very Pelion upon Ossa, of wealth to his
      children. The minds of the readers of journals were now directed to think
      of the hoarded treasures of this favoured country. They might
      approximately be counted, but even if counted they would be past
      conception, like the sidereal system. The contemplation of a million
      stupefies: consider the figures of millions and millions! Articles were
      written on Lombard Street, the world&rsquo;s gold-mine, our granary of energy,
      surpassing all actual and fabulous gold-mines ever spoken of: Aladdin&rsquo;s
      magician would find his purse contracting and squeaking in the comparison.
      Then, too, the store of jewels held by certain private families called for
      remark and an allusion to Sindbad the sailor, whose eyes were to dilate
      wider than they did in the valley of diamonds. Why, we could, if we
      pleased, lie by and pass two or three decades as jolly cricketers and
      scullers, and resume the race for wealth with the rest of mankind, hardly
      sensible of the holiday in our pockets though we were the last people to
      do it, we were the sole people that had the option. Our Fortunatus&rsquo; cap
      was put to better purposes, but to have the cap, and not to be emasculated
      by the possession, might excuse a little reasonable pride in ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus did Optimism and Pessimism have their turn, like the two great
      parties in the State, and the subsiding see-saw restored a proper balance,
      much to the nation&rsquo;s comfort. Unhappily, it was remembered, there are
      spectators of its method of getting to an equipoise out of the agitation
      of extremes. The peep at our treasures to regain composure had, we fear,
      given the foreigner glimpses, and whetted the appetite of our masses. No
      sooner are we at peace than these are heard uttering low howls, and those
      are seen enviously glaring. The spectre, Panic, that ever dogs the
      optimistic feast, warns us of a sack under our beds, and robbers about to
      try a barely-bolted door... Then do we, who have so sweetly sung our
      senses to sleep, start up, in their grip, rush to the doctor and the
      blacksmith, rig alarums, proclaim ourselves intestinally torn,
      defenceless, a prey to foes within and without. It is discovered to be no
      worse than an alderman&rsquo;s dream, but the pessimist frenzy of the night has
      tossed a quieting sop to the Radical, and summoned the volunteers to a
      review. Laudatory articles upon the soldierly &lsquo;march past&rsquo; of our
      volunteers permit of a spell of soft repose, deeper than prudent, at the
      end of it, India and Ireland consenting.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for a passing outline of John Bull&mdash;the shadow on the wall of
      John Mattock. The unostentatious millionaire&rsquo;s legacy to his two children
      affected Mr. Bull thrillingly, pretty nearly as it has here been dotted in
      lining. That is historical. Could he believe in the existence of a son of
      his, a master of millions, who had never sighed (and he had only to sigh)
      to die a peer, or a baronet, or simple Knight? The downright hard-nailed
      coffin fact was there; the wealthiest man in the country had flown away to
      Shadowland a common Mr.! You see the straight deduction from the
      circumstances:&mdash;we are, say what you will, a Republican people!
      Newspaper articles on the watch sympathetically for Mr. Bull&rsquo;s latest view
      of himself, preached on the theme of our peculiar Republicanism. Soon
      after he was observed fondling the Crown Insignia. His bards flung out
      their breezy columns, reverentially monarchial. The Republican was
      informed that they were despised as a blatant minority. A maudlin fit of
      worship of our nobility had hold of him next, and English aristocracy
      received the paean. Lectures were addressed to democrats; our House of
      Lords was pledged solemnly in reams of print. We were told that &lsquo;blood&rsquo; 
      may always be betted on to win the race; blood that is blue will beat the
      red hollow. Who could pretend to despise the honour of admission to the
      ranks of the proudest peerage the world has known! Is not a great
      territorial aristocracy the strongest guarantee of national stability? The
      loudness of the interrogation, like the thunder of Jove, precluded thought
      of an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bull, though he is not of lucid memory, kept an eye on the owner of
      those millions. His bards were awake to his anxiety, and celebrated John
      Mattock&rsquo;s doings with a trump and flourish somewhat displeasing to a
      quietly-disposed commoner. John&rsquo;s entry into Parliament as a Liberal was
      taken for a sign of steersman who knew where the tide ran. But your
      Liberals are sometimes Radicals in their youth, and his choice of parties
      might not be so much sagacity as an instance of unripe lightheadedness. A
      young conservative millionaire is less disturbing. The very wealthy young
      peer is never wanton in his politics, which seems to admonish us that the
      heir of vast wealth should have it imposed on him to accept a peerage, and
      be locked up as it were. A coronet steadies the brain. You may let out
      your heels at the social laws, you are almost expected to do it, but you
      are to shake that young pate of yours restively under such a splendid
      encumbrance. Private reports of John, however, gave him credit for sound
      opinions: he was moderate, merely progressive. When it was added that the
      man had the habit of taking counsel with his sister, he was at once
      considered as fast and safe, not because of any public knowledge of the
      character of Jane Mattock. We pay this homage to the settled common sense
      of women. Distinctly does she discountenance leaps in the dark, wild
      driving, and the freaks of Radicalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      John, as it happened, had not so grave a respect for the sex as for the
      individual Jane. He thought women capable of acts of foolishness; his
      bright-faced sister he could thoroughly trust for prudent conduct. He gave
      her a good portion of his heart in confidence, and all of it in affection.
      There were matters which he excluded from confidence, even from intimate
      communication with himself. These he could not reveal; nor could she
      perfectly open her heart to him, for the same reason. They both had an
      established ideal of their personal qualities, not far above the positive,
      since they were neither of them pretentious, yet it was a trifle higher
      and fairer than the working pattern; and albeit they were sincere enough,
      quite sincere in their mutual intercourse, they had, by what each knew at
      times of the thumping organ within them, cause for doubting that they were
      as transparent as the other supposed; and they were separately aware of an
      inward smile at one another&rsquo;s partial deception; which did not thwart
      their honest power of working up to the respected ideal. The stroke of the
      deeper self-knowledge rarely shook them; they were able to live with full
      sensations in the animated picture they were to the eyes best loved by
      them. This in fact was their life. Anything beside it was a dream, and we
      do not speak of our dreams&mdash;not of every dream. Especially do we
      reserve our speech concerning the dream in which we had a revelation of
      the proud frame deprived of a guiding will, flung rudderless on the waves.
      Ah that abject! The dismantled ship has the grandeur of the tempest about
      it, but the soul swayed by passion is ignominiously bare-poled, detected,
      hooted by its old assumption. If instinct plays fantastical tricks when we
      are sleeping, let it be ever behind a curtain. We can be held guilty only
      if we court exposure. The ideal of English gentleman and gentlewoman is
      closely Roman in the self-repression it exacts, and that it should be but
      occasionally difficult to them shows an affinity with the type. Do you
      perchance, O continental observers of the race, call it hypocritical? It
      is their nature disciplined to the regimental step of civilisation.
      Socially these island men and women of a certain middle rank are veterans
      of an army, and some of the latest enrolled are the stoutest defenders of
      the flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother and sister preserved their little secrets of character apart. They
      could not be expected to unfold what they declined personally to examine.
      But they were not so successful with the lady governing the household,
      their widowed maternal aunt, Mrs. Lackstraw, a woman of decisive
      penetration, and an insubordinate recruit of the army aforesaid. To her
      they were without a mask; John was passion&rsquo;s slave, Jane the most romantic
      of Eve&rsquo;s daughters. She pointed to incidents of their youth; her vision
      was acutely retrospective. The wealth of her nephew and niece caused such
      a view of them to be, as she remarked, anxious past endurance. She had
      grounds for fearing that John, who might step to an alliance with any one
      of the proudest houses in the Kingdom, would marry a beggar-maid. As for
      Jane, she was the natural prey of a threadbare poet. Mrs. Lackstraw heard
      of Mr. Patrick O&rsquo;Donnell, and demanded the right to inspect him. She
      doubted such perfect disinterestedness in any young man as that he should
      slave at account-keeping to that Laundry without a prospect of rich
      remuneration, and the tale of his going down to the city for a couple of
      hours each day to learn the art of keeping books was of very dubious
      import in a cousin of Captain Con O&rsquo;Donnell. &lsquo;Let me see your prodigy,&rsquo; 
      she said, with the emphasis on each word. Patrick was presented at her
      table. She had steeled herself against an Irish tongue. He spoke little,
      appeared simple, professed no enthusiasm for the Laundry. And he paid no
      compliments to Jane: of the two he was more interested by the elder lady,
      whose farm and dairy in Surrey he heard her tell of with a shining glance,
      observing that he liked thick cream: there was a touch of home in it. The
      innocent sensuality in the candid avowal of his tastes inspired
      confidence. Mrs. Lackstraw fished for some account of his home. He was
      open to flow on the subject; he dashed a few sketches of mother and
      sisters, dowerless girls, fresh as trout in the stream, and of his own
      poor estate, and the peasantry, with whom he was on friendly terms. He was
      an absentee for his education. Sweet water, pure milk, potatoes and bread,
      were the things he coveted in plenty for his people and himself, he said,
      calling forth an echo from Mrs. Lackstraw, and an invitation to come down
      to her farm in the Spring. &lsquo;That is, Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell, if you are still in
      London.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m bound apprentice for a year,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was asked whether he did not find it tiresome work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A trifle so,&rsquo; he confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then why did he pursue it, the question was put.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not alive for his own pleasure, and would like to feel he was doing
      a bit of good, was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could one, Mrs. Lackstraw asked herself, have faith in this young
      Irishman? He possessed an estate. His brogue rather added to his air of
      truthfulness. His easy manners and the occasional streak of correct French
      in his dialogue cast a shadow on it. Yet he might be an ingenuous creature
      precisely because of the suspicion roused by his quaint unworldliness that
      he might be a terrible actor. Why not?&mdash;his heart was evidently much
      more interested in her pursuits than in her niece&rsquo;s. The juvenility of him
      was catching, if it was indeed the man, and not one of the actor&rsquo;s
      properties. Mrs. Lackstraw thought it prudent to hint at the latter idea
      to Jane while she decided in her generosity to embrace the former. Oh! if
      all Irishmen shared his taste for sweet water, pure milk and wholesome
      bread, what a true Union we should have! She had always insisted on those
      three things as most to be desired on earth for the masses, and she
      reminded Jane of it as a curious fact. Jane acquiesced, having always
      considered it a curious fact that her aunt should combine the relish of a
      country life with the intensest social ambition&mdash;a passion so
      sensitive as to make the name her husband had inflicted on her a pain and
      a burden. The name of Mattock gave her horrors. She spoke of it openly to
      prove that Jane must marry a title and John become a peer. Never was there
      such a name to smell of the soil. She declared her incapacity to die happy
      until the two had buried Mattock. Her own one fatal step condemned her,
      owing to the opinion she held upon the sacredness of marriage, as
      Lackstraw on her tombstone, and to Lackstraw above the earthly martyr
      would go bearing the designation which marked her to be claimed by him.
      But for John and Jane the index of Providence pointed a brighter passage
      through life. They had only to conquer the weakness native to them&mdash;the
      dreadful tendency downward. They had, in the spiritual sense, frail
      hearts. The girl had been secretive about the early activity of hers,
      though her aunt knew of two or three adventures wanting in nothing save
      boldness to have put an end to her independence and her prospects:&mdash;hence
      this Laundry business! a clear sign of some internal disappointment. The
      boy, however, had betrayed himself in his mother&rsquo;s days, when it required
      all her influence and his father&rsquo;s authority, with proof positive of the
      woman&rsquo;s unworthiness, to rescue him from immediate disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lackstraw&rsquo;s confidences on the theme of the family she watched over
      were extended to Patrick during their strolls among the ducks and fowls
      and pheasants at her farm. She dealt them out in exclamations, as much as
      telling him that now they knew him they trusted him, notwithstanding the
      unaccountable part he played as honorary secretary to that Laundry. The
      confidences, he was aware, were common property of the visitors one after
      another, but he had the knowledge of his being trusted as not every
      Irishman would have been. A service of six months to the secretaryship
      established his reputation as the strange bird of a queer species: not
      much less quiet, honest, methodical, than an Englishman, and still
      impulsive, Irish still; a very strange bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disposition of the English to love the children of Erin, when not
      fretted by them, was shown in the treatment Patrick received from the
      Mattock family. It is a love resembling the affection of the stage-box for
      a set of favourite performers, and Patrick, a Celt who had schooled his
      wits to observe and meditate, understood his position with them as one of
      the gallant and amusing race, as well as the reason why he had won their
      private esteem. They are not willingly suspicious: it agitates their minds
      to be so; and they are most easily lulled by the flattery of seeing their
      special virtues grafted on an alien stock: for in this admiration of
      virtues that are so necessary to the stalwart growth of man, they become
      just sensible of a minor deficiency; the tree, if we jump out of it to
      examine its appearance, should not be all trunk. Six months of ungrudging
      unremunerated service, showing devotion to the good cause and perfect
      candour from first to last, was English, and a poetic touch beyond: so
      that John Mattock, if he had finished the sentence instead of lopping it
      with an interjection, would have said: &lsquo;These Irish fellows, when they&rsquo;re
      genuine and first rate!&mdash;are pretty well the pick of the land.&rsquo; 
      Perhaps his pause on the interjection expressed a doubt of our getting
      them genuine. Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell was a sort of exceptional Irishman, not devoid
      of practical ability in a small way&mdash;he did his duties of secretary
      fairly well; apparently sincere&mdash;he had refrained from courting Jane;
      an odd creature enough, what with his mixture of impulsiveness and
      discretion; likeable, pleasant to entertain and talk to; not one of your
      lunatics concerning his country&mdash;he could listen to an Englishman&rsquo;s
      opinion on that head, listen composedly to Rockney, merely seeming to take
      notes; and Rockney was, as Captain Con termed him, Press Dragoon about
      Ireland, a trying doctor for a child of the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, John Mattock could shake his hand heartily when he was
      leaving our shores. Patrick was released by Miss Grace Barrow&rsquo;s discovery
      at last of a lady capable of filling his place: a circumstance that he did
      not pretend to regret. He relinquished his post and stood aside with the
      air of a disciplined soldier. This was at the expiration of seven months
      and two weeks of service. Only after he had gone, upon her receiving his
      first letter from the Continent, did Jane distinguish in herself the
      warmth of friendliness she felt for him, and know that of all around her
      she, reproaching every one who had hinted a doubt, had been the most
      suspicious of his pure simplicity. It was the vice of her condition to be
      suspicious of the honesty of men. She thought of her looks as less
      attractive than they were; of her wealth she had reason to think that the
      scent transformed our sad sex into dogs under various disguises.
      Remembering her chill once on hearing Patrick in a green lane where they
      botanised among spring flowers call himself her Irish cousin, as if he had
      advanced a step and betrayed the hoof, she called him her Irish cousin now
      in good earnest. Her nation was retrospectively enthusiastic. The
      cordiality of her letter of reply to the wandering Patrick astonished him
      on the part of so cool a young lady; and Captain Con, when he heard Miss
      Mattock speak of Patrick to his wife, came to the conclusion that the
      leery lad had gone a far way toward doing the trick for himself, though
      Jane said his correspondence was full of the deeds of his brother in
      India. She quite sparkled in speaking of this boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She and the captain had an interchange of sparklings over absent Patrick,
      at a discovery made by Miss Colesworth, the lady replacing him, in a nook
      of the amateur secretary&rsquo;s official desk, under heaps of pamphlets and
      slips, French and English and Irish journals, not at all bearing upon the
      business of the Laundry. It was a blotting-pad stuffed with Patrick&rsquo;s
      jottings. Jane brought it to Con as to the proper keeper of the reliquary.
      He persuaded her to join him in examining it, and together they bent their
      heads, turning leaf by leaf, facing, laughing, pursuing the search for
      more, sometimes freely shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her inspection of the contents had previously been shy; she had just
      enough to tell her they were funny. Dozens of scraps, insides of torn
      envelopes, invitation-cards, ends of bills received from home, whatever
      was handy to him at the moment, had done service for the overflow of Mr.
      Secretary&rsquo;s private notes and reflections; the blotting-paper as well;
      though that was devoted chiefly to sketches of the human countenance, the
      same being almost entirely of the fair. Jane fancied she spied herself
      among the number. Con saw the likeness, but not considering it a
      complimentary one, he whisked over the leaf. Grace Barrow was
      unmistakeable. Her dimpled cushion features, and very intent eyes gazing
      out of the knolls and dingles, were given without caricature. Miss
      Colesworth appeared on the last page, a half-length holding a big key,
      demure between curls. The key was explained by a cage on a stool, and a
      bird flying out. She had unlocked the cage for Patrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He never seemed anxious to be released while he was at work,&rsquo; said Jane,
      after she and the captain had spelt the symbolling in turns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And never thirsted to fly till he flew, I warrant him,&rsquo; said Con.
    </p>
    <p>
      A repeated sketch of some beauty confused them both; neither of them could
      guess the proud owner of those lineaments. Con proclaimed it to be merely
      one of the lad&rsquo;s recollections, perhaps a French face. He thought he might
      have seen a face rather resembling it, but could not call to mind whose
      face it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say it&rsquo;s just a youngster&rsquo;s dream on a stool at a desk, as poets
      write sonnets in their youth to nobody, till they&rsquo;re pierced by somebody,
      and then there&rsquo;s a difference in their handwriting,&rsquo; he said, vexed with
      Patrick for squandering his opportunity to leave a compliment to the
      heiress behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane flipped the leaves back to the lady with stormy hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you&rsquo;ll have the whole book, and hand it to him when he returns; it
      &lsquo;ll come best from you,&rsquo; said Con. &lsquo;The man on horseback, out of uniform,
      &lsquo;s brother Philip, of course. And man and horse are done to the life.
      Pray, take it, Miss Mattock. I should lose it to a certainty; I should; I
      can&rsquo;t be trusted. You&rsquo;ll take it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her so warmly to retain the bundle in her custody that she
      carried it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange to say the things she had laughed at had been the things which
      struck her feelings and sympathies. Patrick&rsquo;s notes here and there
      recalled conversations he had more listened to than taken part in between
      herself and Grace Barrow. Who could help laughing at his ideas about
      women! But if they were crude, they were shrewd&mdash;or so she thought
      them; and the jejuneness was, to her mind, chiefly in the dressing of
      them. Grace agreed with her, for Grace had as good a right to inspect the
      papers as she, and a glance had shown that there was nothing of peculiar
      personal import in his notes: he did not brood on himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was one which tickled the ladies and formed a text for discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Women must take the fate of market-fruit till they earn their own
      pennies, and then they &lsquo;ll regulate the market. It is a tussle for money
      with them as with us, meaning power. They&rsquo;d do it as little by oratory as
      they have done by millinery, for their oratory, just like their millinery,
      appeals to a sentiment, and to a weaker; and nothing solid comes of a
      sentiment. Power is built on work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To this was appended: &lsquo;The better for mankind in the developing process,
      ay, and a bad day for us, boys, when study masks the charming eyes in
      gig-lamps, and there is no pretty flying before us. Good-night to Cupid, I
      fear. May be I am not seeing far enough, and am asking for the devil to
      have the loveliest women as of old. Retro S. M.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The youthful eye on their sex, the Irish voice, and the perceptible moral
      earnestness in the background, made up a quaint mixture.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. OF THE GREAT MR. BULL AND THE CELTIC AND SAXON VIEW OF HIM:
      AND SOMETHING OF RICHARD ROCKNEY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meanwhile India, our lubber giant, had ceased to kick a leg, and Ireland,
      our fever-invalid, wore the aspect of an opiate slumber. The volcano we
      couch on was quiet, the gritty morsel unabsorbed within us at an armistice
      with the gastric juices. Once more the personification of the country&rsquo;s
      prosperity had returned to the humming state of roundness. Trade whipped
      him merrily, and he spun.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fuller sketch of the figure of this remarkable emanation of us and
      object of our worship, Bull, is required that we may breathe the
      atmosphere of a story dealing with such very different views of the idol,
      and learn to tolerate plain-speaking about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fancy yourself delayed by stress of weather at an inn or an excursion, and
      snapped up by some gossip drone of the district, who hearing whither you
      are bound, recounts the history and nature of the place, to your ultimate
      advantage, though you groan for the outer downpour to abate.&mdash;Of
      Bull, then: our image, before the world: our lord and tyrant, ourself in
      short&mdash;the lower part of us. Coldly worshipped on the whole, he can
      create an enthusiasm when his roast-beef influence mounts up to peaceful
      skies and the domestic English world spins with him. What he does not like
      will then be the forbidding law of a most governable people, what he does
      like the consenting. If it is declared that argument will be inefficacious
      to move him, he is adored in the form of post. A hint of his willingness
      in any direction, causes a perilous rush of his devotees. Nor is there
      reason to suppose we have drawn the fanatical subserviency from the
      example of our subject India. We may deem it native; perhaps of its origin
      Aryan, but we have made it our own. Some have been so venturesome as to
      trace the lordliness of Bull to the protecting smiles of the good Neptune,
      whose arms are about him to encourage the development of a wanton
      eccentricity. Certain weeds of the human bosom are prompt to flourish
      where safeness would seem to be guaranteed. Men, for instance, of stoutly
      independent incomes are prone to the same sort of wilfulness as Bull&rsquo;s,
      the salve abject submission to it which we behold in his tidal bodies of
      supporters. Neptune has done something. One thinks he has done much, at a
      rumour of his inefficiency to do the utmost. Spy you insecurity?&mdash;a
      possibility of invasion? Then indeed the colossal creature, inaccessible
      to every argument, is open to any suggestion: the oak-like is a reed, the
      bull a deer. But as there is no attack on his shores, there is no proof
      that they are invulnerable. Neptune is appealed to and replies by mouth of
      the latest passenger across the Channel on a windy night:&mdash;Take
      heart, son John! They will have poor stomachs for blows who intrude upon
      you. The testification to the Sea-God&rsquo;s watchfulness restores his darling
      who is immediately as horny to argument as before. Neptune shall have his
      share of the honours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ideal of his country Bull has none&mdash;he hates the word; it smells of
      heresy, opposition to his image. It is an exercise of imagination to
      accept an ideal, and his digestive organs reject it, after the manner of
      the most beautiful likeness of him conjurable to the mind&mdash;that
      flowering stomach, the sea-anemone, which opens to anything and speedily
      casts out what it cannot consume. He is a positive shape, a practical
      corporation, and the best he can see is the mirror held up to him by his
      bards of the Press and his jester Frank Guffaw. There, begirt by laughing
      ocean-waves, manifestly blest, he glorifies his handsome roundness, like
      that other Foam-Born, whom the decorative Graces robed in vestments not so
      wonderful as printed sheets. Rounder at each inspection, he preaches to
      mankind from the text of a finger curved upon the pattern spectacles. Your
      Frenchmen are revolutionising, wagering on tentative politics; your
      Germans ploughing in philosophy, thumbing classics, composing music of a
      novel order: both are marching, evolutionising, learning how to kill.
      Ridiculous Germans! capricious Frenchmen! We want nothing new in musical
      composition and abstract speculation of an indecent mythology, or
      political contrivances and schemes of Government, and we do not want war.
      Peace is the Goddess we court for the hand of her daughter Plenty, and we
      have won that jolly girl, and you are welcome to the marriage-feast; but
      avaunt new-fangled theories and howlings: old tunes, tried systems, for
      us, my worthy friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roundness admiring the growth of its globe may address majestic invitation
      to the leaner kine. It can exhibit to the world that Peace is a most
      desirable mother-in-law; and it is tempted to dream of capping the
      pinnacle of wisdom when it squats on a fundamental truth. Bull&rsquo;s perusal
      of the Horatian carpe diem is acute as that of the cattle in fat meads; he
      walks like lusty Autumn carrying his garner to drum on, for a sign of his
      diligent wisdom in seizing the day. He can read the page fronting him; and
      let it be of dining, drinking, toasting, he will vociferously confute the
      wiseacre bookworms who would have us believe there is no such thing as a
      present hour for man.
    </p>
    <p>
      In sad fact, the member for England is often intoxicate. Often do we have
      him whirling his rotundity like a Mussulman dervish inflated by the spirit
      to agitate the shanks, until pangs of a commercial crisis awaken him to
      perceive an infructuous past and an unsown future, without one bit of
      tracery on its black breast other than that which his apprehensions
      project. As for a present hour, it swims, it vanishes, thinner than the
      phantom banquets of recollection. What has he done for the growth of his
      globe of brains?&mdash;the lesser, but in our rightful posture the upper,
      and justly the directing globe, through whose directions we do, by feeding
      on the past to sow the future, create a sensible present composed of both&mdash;the
      present of the good using of our powers. What can he show in the Arts?
      What in Arms? His bards&mdash;O faithless! but they are men&mdash;his
      bards accuse him of sheer cattle-contentedness in the mead, of sterility
      of brain, drowsihood, mid-noddyism, downright carcase-dulness. They
      question him to deafen him of our defences, our intellectual eminence, our
      material achievements, our poetry, our science; they sneer at his trust in
      Neptune, doubt the scaly invulnerability of the God. They point over to
      the foreigner, the clean-stepping, braced, self-confident foreigner, good
      at arms, good at the arts, and eclipsing us in industriousness manual and
      mental, and some dare to say, in splendour of verse=-our supreme
      accomplishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then with one big fellow, the collapse of pursiness, he abandons his
      pedestal of universal critic; prostrate he falls to the foreigner; he is
      down, he is roaring; he is washing his hands of English performances,
      lends ear to foreign airs, patronises foreign actors, browses on reports
      from camps of foreign armies. He drops his head like a smitten ox to all
      great foreign names, moaning &lsquo;Shakespeare!&rsquo; internally for a sustaining
      apostrophe. He well-nigh loves his poets, can almost understand what
      poetry means. If it does not pay, it brings him fame, respectfulness in
      times of reverse. Brains, he is reduced to apprehend, brains are the
      generators of the conquering energies. He is now for brains at all costs,
      he has gained a conception of them. He is ready to knock knighthood on the
      heads of men of brains&mdash;even literary brains. They shall be knights,
      an ornamental body. To make them peers, and a legislative, has not struck
      him, for he has not yet imagined them a stable body. They require petting,
      to persuade them to flourish and bring him esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is Mr. Bull, our image before the world, whose pranks are passed as
      though the vivid display of them had no bad effect on the nation.
      Doubtless the perpetual mirror, the slavish mirror, is to blame, but his
      nakedness does not shrink from the mirror, he likes it and he is proud of
      it. Beneath these exhibitions the sober strong spirit of the country,
      unfortunately not a prescient one, nor an attractively loveable, albeit of
      a righteous benevolence, labours on, doing the hourly duties for the sake
      of conscience, little for prospective security, little to win affection.
      Behold it as the donkey of a tipsy costermonger, obedient to go without
      the gift of expression. Its behaviour is honourable under a discerning
      heaven, and there is ever something pathetic in a toilful speechlessness;
      but it is of dogged attitude in the face of men. Salt is in it to keep our
      fleshly grass from putrefaction; poets might proclaim its virtues. They
      will not; they are averse. The only voice it has is the Puritan bray, upon
      which one must philosophise asinically to unveil the charm. So the world
      is pleased to let it be obscured by the paunch of Bull. We have, however,
      isolated groups, individuals in all classes, by no means delighting in his
      representation of them. When such is felt to be the case among a
      sufficient number, his bards blow him away as a vapour; we hear that he is
      a piece of our English humour&mdash;we enjoy grotesques and never should
      agree to paint ourselves handsome: our subtle conceit insists on the
      reverse. Nevertheless, no sooner are the hours auspicious to fatness than
      Bull is back on us; he is our family goat, ancestral ghost, the genius of
      our comfortable sluggishness. And he is at times a mad Bull: a foaming,
      lashing, trampling, horn-driving, excessive, very parlous Bull. It is in
      his history that frenzies catch him, when to be yoked to him is to suffer
      frightful shakings, not to mention a shattering of our timbers. It is but
      in days of the rousing of the under-spirit of the country, days of storm
      imprudent to pray the advent of, that we are well rid of him for a while.
      In the interim he does mischief, serious mischief; he does worse than
      when, a juvenile, he paid the Dannegelt for peace. Englishmen of feeling
      do not relish him. For men with Irish and Cambrian blood in their veins
      the rubicund grotesque, with his unimpressionable front and his noisy
      benevolence of the pocket, his fits of horned ferocity and lapses of
      hardheartedness, is a shame and a loathing. You attach small importance to
      images and symbols; yet if they seem representative, and they sicken
      numbers of us, they are important. The hat we wear, though it is not a
      part of the head, stamps the character of our appearance and has a
      positive influence on our bearing. Symbolical decorations will stimulate
      the vacant-minded to act up to them, they encircle and solidify the mass;
      they are a sword of division between Celts and Saxons if they are
      abhorrent to one section. And the Celtic brotherhood are not invariably
      fools in their sensitiveness. They serve you on the field of Mars, and on
      other fields to which the world has given glory. These execrate him as the
      full-grown Golden Calf of heathenish worship. And they are so restive
      because they are so patriotic. Think a little upon the ideas of
      unpatriotic Celts regarding him. You have heard them. You tell us they are
      you: accurately, they affirm, succinctly they see you in his crescent
      outlines, tame bulk, spasms of alarm and foot on the weaker; his
      imperviousness to whatsoever does not confront the sensual eye of him with
      a cake or a fist, his religious veneration of his habitual indulgences,
      his peculiar forms of nightmare. They swear to his perfect personification
      of your moods, your Saxon moods, which their inconsiderate spleen would
      have us take for unmixedly Saxon. They are unjust, but many of them speak
      with a sense of the foot on their necks, and they are of a blood demanding
      a worshipworthy idea. And they dislike Bull&rsquo;s bellow of disrespect for
      their religion, much bruited in the meadows during his periods of Arcadia.
      They dislike it, cannot forget the sound: it hangs on the afflicted drum
      of the ear when they are in another land, perhaps when the old devotion to
      their priest has expired. For this, as well as for material reasons, they
      hug the hatred they packed up among their bundles of necessaries and
      relics, in the flight from home, and they instruct their children to keep
      it burning. They transmit the sentiment of the loathing of Bull, as
      assuredly they would be incapable of doing, even with the will, were a
      splendid fire-eyed motherly Britannia the figure sitting in the minds of
      men for our image&mdash;a palpitating figure, alive to change, penetrable
      to thought, and not a stolid concrete of our traditional old yeoman
      characteristic. Verily he lives for the present, all for the present, will
      be taught in sorrow that there is no life for him but of past and future:
      his delusion of the existence of a present hour for man will not outlast
      the season of his eating and drinking abundantly in security. He will
      perceive that it was no more than the spark shot out from the clash of
      those two meeting forces; and penitently will he gaze back on that
      misleading spark-the spectral planet it bids wink to his unreceptive stars&mdash;acknowledging
      him the bare machine for those two to drive, no instrument of enjoyment.
      He lives by reading rearward and seeing vanward. He has no actual life
      save in power of imagination. He has to learn this fact, the great lesson
      of all men. Furthermore there may be a future closed to him if he has
      thrown too extreme a task of repairing on that bare machine of his. The
      sight of a broken-down plough is mournful, but the one thing to do with it
      is to remove it from the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the patriotic of stout English substance, who blew in the trumpet of
      the country, and were not bards of Bull to celebrate his firmness and
      vindicate his shiftings, Richard Rockney takes front rank. A journalist
      altogether given up to his craft, considering the audience he had gained,
      he was a man of forethought besides being a trenchant writer, and he was
      profoundly, not less than eminently, the lover of Great Britain. He had a
      manner of utterance quite in the tone of the familiar of the antechamber
      for proof of his knowing himself to be this person. He did not so much
      write articles upon the health of his mistress as deliver Orphic
      sentences. He was in one her physician, her spiritual director, her
      man-at-arms. Public allusions to her were greeted with his emphatic assent
      in a measured pitch of the voice, or an instantaneous flourish of the
      rapier; and the flourish was no vain show. He meant hard steel to defend
      the pill he had prescribed for her constitutional state, and the monition
      for her soul&rsquo;s welfare. Nor did he pretend to special privileges in
      assuming his militant stand, but simply that he had studied her case, was
      intimate with her resources, and loved her hotly, not to say inspiredly.
      Love her as well, you had his cordial hand; as wisely, then all his
      weapons to back you. There were occasions when distinguished officials and
      Parliamentary speakers received the impetus of Rockney&rsquo;s approval and not
      hesitatingly he stepped behind them to bestow it. The act, in whatever
      fashion it may have been esteemed by the objects propelled, was a sign of
      his willingness to let the shadow of any man adopting his course obscure
      him, and of the simplicity of his attachment. If a bitter experience
      showed that frequently, indeed generally, they travelled scarce a
      tottering stagger farther than they were precipitated, the wretched
      consolation afforded by a side glance at a more enlightened passion,
      solitary in its depth, was Rockney&rsquo;s. Others perchance might equal his
      love, none the wisdom of it; actually none the vigilant circumspection,
      the shaping forethought. That clear knowledge of the right thing for the
      country was grasped but by fits by others. Enough to profit them this way
      and yonder as one best can! You know the newspaper Press is a mighty
      engine. Still he had no delight in shuffling a puppetry; he would have
      preferred automatic figures. His calls for them resounded through the
      wilderness of the wooden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any solid conviction of a capable head of a certainty impressed upon the
      world, and thus his changes of view were not attributed to a fluctuating
      devotion; they passed out of the range of criticism upon inconsistency,
      notwithstanding that the commencement of his journalistic career smelt of
      sources entirely opposed to the conclusions upon which it broadened. One
      secret of the belief in his love of his country was the readiness of
      Rockney&rsquo;s pen to support our nobler patriotic impulses, his relish of the
      bluff besides. His eye was on our commerce, on our courts of Law, on our
      streets and alleys, our army and navy, our colonies, the vaster than the
      island England, and still he would be busy picking up needles and threads
      in the island. Deeds of valour were noted by him, lapses of cowardice: how
      one man stood against a host for law or humanity, how crowds looked on at
      the beating of a woman, how a good fight was maintained in some sly ring
      between two of equal brawn: and manufacturers were warned of the
      consequences of their iniquities, Government was lashed for sleeping upon
      shaky ordinances, colonists were gibbeted for the maltreating of natives:
      the ring and fervour of the notes on daily events told of Rockney&rsquo;s hand
      upon the national heart&mdash;with a faint, an enforced, reluctant
      indication of our not being the men we were.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after all, the main secret was his art of writing round English,
      instead of laborious Latinised periods: and the secret of the art was his
      meaning what he said. It was the personal throb. The fire of a mind was
      translucent in Press columns where our public had been accustomed to the
      rhetoric of primed scribes. He did away with the Biscay billow of the
      leading article&mdash;Bull&rsquo;s favourite prose&mdash;bardic construction of
      sentences that roll to the antithetical climax, whose foamy top is offered
      and gulped as equivalent to an idea. Writing of such a kind as Rockney&rsquo;s
      was new to a land where the political opinions of Joint Stock Companies
      had rattled Jovian thunders obedient to the nod of Bull. Though not alone
      in working the change, he was the foremost. And he was not devoid of
      style. Fervidness is the core of style. He was a tough opponent for his
      betters in education, struck forcibly, dexterously, was always alert for
      debate. An encounter between Swift and Johnson, were it imaginable, would
      present us probably the most prodigious Gigantomachy in literary polemics.
      It is not imaginable among comparative pygmies. But Rockney&rsquo;s combat with
      his fellow-politicians of the Press partook of the Swiftian against the
      Johnsonian in form. He was a steam ram that drove straight at the bulky
      broadside of the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Premiers of parties might be Captains of the State for Rockney: Rockney
      was the premier&rsquo;s pilot, or woe to him. Woe to the country as well, if
      Rockney&rsquo;s directions for steering were unheeded. He was a man of
      forethought, the lover of Great Britain: he shouted his directions in the
      voice of the lover of his mistress, urged to rebuke, sometimes to command,
      the captain by the prophetic intimations of a holier alliance, a more
      illumined prescience. Reefs here, shallows there, yonder a foul course:
      this is the way for you! The refusal of the captain to go this way caused
      Rockney sincerely to discredit the sobriety of his intellect. It was a
      drunken captain. Or how if a traitorous? We point out the danger to him,
      and if he will run the country on to it, we proclaim him guilty either of
      inebriety or of treason&mdash;the alternatives are named: one or the other
      has him. Simple unfitness can scarcely be conceived of a captain having
      our common senses and a warranted pilot at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had not Rockney been given to a high expression of opinion, plain in
      fervour, he would often have been exposed bare to hostile shafts. Style
      cast her aegis over him. He wore an armour in which he could walk, run and
      leap-a natural style. The ardour of his temperament suffused the
      directness of his intelligence to produce it, and the two qualities made
      his weakness and strength. Feeling the nerve of strength, the weakness was
      masked to him, while his opponents were equally insensible to the weakness
      under the force of his blows. Thus there was nothing to teach him, or
      reveal him, except Time, whose trick is to turn corners of unanticipated
      sharpness, and leave the directly seeing and ardent to dash at walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      How rigidly should the man of forethought govern himself, question
      himself! how constantly wrestle with himself! And if he be a writer
      ebullient by the hour, how snappishly suspect himself, that he may feel in
      conscience worthy of a hearing and have perpetually a conscience in his
      charge! For on what is his forethought founded? Does he try the ring of it
      with our changed conditions? Bus a man of forethought who has to be one of
      our geysers ebullient by the hour must live days of fever. His
      apprehensions distemper his blood; the scrawl of them on the dark of the
      undeveloped dazzles his brain. He sees in time little else; his very
      sincereness twists him awry. Such a man has the stuff of the born
      journalist, and journalism is the food of the age. Ask him, however,
      midway in his running, what he thinks of quick breathing: he will answer
      that to be a shepherd on the downs is to be more a man. As to the gobbling
      age, it really thinks better of him than he of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a term of prolonged preachification he is compelled to lash that he
      may less despise the age. He has to do it for his own sake. O gobbling
      age! swallowing all, digesting nought, us too you have swallowed, O
      insensate mechanism! and we will let you know you have a stomach.
      Furiously we disagree with you. We are in you to lead you or work you
      pangs!
    </p>
    <p>
      Rockney could not be a mild sermoniser commenting on events. Rather no
      journalism at all for him! He thought the office of the ordinary daily
      preacher cowlike. His gadfly stung him to warn, dictate, prognosticate; he
      was the oracle and martyr of superior vision: and as in affairs of
      business and the weighing of men he was of singularly cool sagacity, hard
      on the downright, open to the humours of the distinct discrimination of
      things in their roughness, the knowledge of the firmly-based materialism
      of his nature caused him thoroughly to trust to his voice when he
      delivered it in ardour&mdash;circumstance coming to be of daily
      recurrence. Great love creates forethoughtfulness, without which incessant
      journalism is a gabble. He was sure of his love, but who gave ear to his
      prescience? Few: the echo of the country now and then, the Government not
      often. And, dear me! those jog-trot sermonisers, mere commentators upon
      events, manage somehow to keep up the sale of their journals:
      advertisements do not flow and ebb with them as under the influence of a
      capricious moon. Ah, what a public! Serve it honourably, you are in peril
      of collapsing: show it nothing but the likeness of its dull animal face,
      you are steadily inflated. These reflections within us! Might not one
      almost say that the retreat for the prophet is the wilderness, far from
      the hustled editor&rsquo;s desk; and annual should be the uplifting of his voice
      instead of diurnal, if only to spare his blood the distemper? A fund of
      gout was in Rockney&rsquo;s, and he had begun to churn it. Between gouty blood
      and luminous brain the strife had set in which does not conduce to
      unwavering sobriety of mind, though ideas remain closely consecutive and
      the utterance resonant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had he been an adulator of Bull. His defects as well as his
      advantages as a politician preserved to him this virtue. Insisting on a
      future, he could not do homage to the belying simulacrum of the present.
      In the season of prosperity Rockney lashed the old fellow with the crisis
      he was breeding for us; and when prostration ensued no English tongue was
      loftier in preaching dignity and the means of recovery. Our monumental
      image of the Misuse of Peace he pointed out unceasingly as at a despot
      constructed by freemen out of the meanest in their natures to mock the
      gift of liberty. His articles of foregone years were an extraordinary
      record of events or conditions foreseen: seductive in the review of them
      by a writer who has to be still foreseeing: nevertheless, that none of
      them were bardic of Bull, and that our sound man would have acted wisely
      in heeding some of the prescriptions, constituted their essential merit,
      consolatory to think of, though painful. The country has gone the wrong
      road, but it may yet cross over to the right one, when it perceives that
      we were prophetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compared with the bolts discharged at Bull by Rockney&rsquo;s artillery, Captain
      Con O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s were popgun-pellets. Only Rockney fired to chasten, Con
      O&rsquo;Donnell for a diversion, to appease an animus. The revolutionist in
      English journalism was too devoutly patriotic to belabour even a pantomime
      mask that was taken as representative of us for the disdainful fun of it.
      Behind the plethoric lamp, now blown with the fleshpots, now gasping puffs
      of panic, he saw the well-minded valorous people, issue of glorious
      grandsires; a nation under a monstrous defacement, stupefied by the
      contemplation of the mask: his vision was of the great of old, the
      possibly great in the graver strife ahead, respecters of life, despisers
      of death, the real English whereas an alienated Celtic satirist, through
      his vivid fancy and his disesteem, saw the country incarnate in Bull, at
      most a roguish screw-kneed clown to be whipped out of him. Celt and Saxon
      are much inmixed with us, but the prevalence of Saxon blood is evinced by
      the public disregard of any Celtic conception of the honourable and the
      loveable; so that the Celt anxious to admire is rebutted, and the hatred
      of a Celt, quick as he is to catch at images, has a figure of hugeous
      animalism supplied to his malign contempt. Rockney&rsquo;s historic England, and
      the living heroic England to slip from that dull hide in a time of trial,
      whether of war or social suffering, he cannot see, nor a people hardening
      to Spartan lineaments in the fire, iron men to meet disaster, worshippers
      of a discerned God of Laws, and just men too, thinking to do justice; he
      has Bull on the eye, the alternately braggart and poltroon, sweating in
      labour that he may gorge the fruits, graceless to a scoffer. And this is
      the creature to whose tail he is tied! Hereditary hatred is approved by
      critical disgust. Some spirited brilliancy, some persistent generosity
      (other than the guzzle&rsquo;s flash of it), might soften him; something sweeter
      than the slow animal well-meaningness his placable brethren point his
      attention to. It is not seen, and though he can understand the perils of a
      severance, he prefers to rub the rawness of his wound and be ready to
      pitch his cap in the air for it, out of sheer bloodloathing of a
      connection that offers him nothing to admire, nothing to hug to his heart.
      Both below and above the blind mass of discontent in his island, the
      repressed sentiment of admiration-or passion of fealty and thirst to give
      himself to a visible brighter&mdash;is an element of the division:
      meditative young Patrick O&rsquo;Donnell early in his reflections had noted
      that:&mdash;and it is partly a result of our daily habit of tossing the
      straw to the monetary world and doting on ourselves in the mirror, until
      our habitual doings are viewed in a bemused complacency by us, and the
      scum-surface of the country is flashed about as its vital being. A man of
      forethought using the Press to spur Parliament to fitly represent the
      people, and writing on his daily topics with strenuous original vigour,
      even though, like Rockney, he sets the teeth of the Celt gnashing at him,
      goes a step nearer to the bourne of pacification than Press and Parliament
      reflecting the popular opinion that law must be passed to temper Ireland&rsquo;s
      eruptiveness; for that man can be admired, and the Celt, in combating him,
      will like an able and gallant enemy better than a grudgingly just,
      lumbersome, dull, politic friend. The material points in a division are
      always the stronger, but the sentimental are here very strong. Pass the
      laws; they may put an extinguisher on the Irish Vesuvian; yet to be loved
      you must be a little perceptibly admirable. You may be so self-satisfied
      as to dispense with an ideal: your yoke-fellow is not; it is his
      particular form of strength to require one for his proper blooming, and he
      does bloom beautifully in the rays he courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah then, seek to be loved, and banish Bull. Believe in a future and banish
      that gross obscuration of you. Decline to let that old-yeoman-turned
      alderman stand any longer for the national man. Speaking to the brain of
      the country, one is sure of the power of a resolute sign from it to
      dismiss the brainless. Banish him your revels and your debatings, prohibit
      him your Christmas, lend no ear either to his panics or his testiness,
      especially none to his rages; do not report him at all, and he will soon
      subside into his domestic, varied by pothouse, privacy. The brain should
      lead, if there be a brain. Once free of him, you will know that for half a
      century you have appeared bottom upward to mankind. And you have wondered
      at the absence of love for you under so astounding a presentation. Even in
      a Bull, beneficent as he can dream of being, when his notions are in a
      similar state of inversion, should be sheepish in hope for love.
    </p>
    <p>
      He too, whom you call the Welshman, and deride for his delight in songful
      gatherings, harps to wild Wales, his Cambrian highlands, and not to
      England. You have not yet, though he is orderly and serviceable, allured
      his imagination to the idea of England. Despite the passion for his
      mountains and the boon of your raising of the interdict (within a hundred
      years) upon his pastors to harangue him in his native tongue, he gladly
      ships himself across the waters traversed by his Prince Madoc of
      tradition, and becomes contentedly a transatlantic citizen, a member of
      strange sects&mdash;he so inveterate in faithfulness to the hoar and the
      legendary!&mdash;Anything rather than Anglican. The Cymry bear you no
      hatred; their affection likewise is undefined. But there is reason to
      think that America has caught the imagination of the Cambrian Celt: names
      of Welshmen are numerous in the small army of the States of the Union; and
      where men take soldier-service they are usually fixed, they and their
      children. Here is one, not very deeply injured within a century, of ardent
      temperament, given to be songful and loving; he leaves you and forgets
      you. Be certain that the material grounds of division are not all. To
      pronounce it his childishness provokes the retort upon your presented
      shape. He cannot admire it. Gaelic Scots wind the same note of repulsion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And your poets are in a like predicament. Your poets are the most
      persuasive of springs to a lively general patriotism. They are in the
      Celtic dilemma of standing at variance with Bull; they return him his
      hearty antipathy, are unable to be epical or lyrical of him, are condemned
      to expend their genius upon the abstract, the quaint, the picturesque.
      Nature they read spiritually or sensually, always shrinkingly apart from
      him. They swell to a resemblance of their patron if they stoop to woo his
      purse. He has, on hearing how that poets bring praise to nations, as in
      fact he can now understand his Shakespeare to have done, been seen to
      thump the midriff and rally them for their shyness of it, telling them he
      doubts them true poets while they abstain from singing him to the
      world-him, and the things refreshing the centre of him. Ineffectual is
      that encouragement. Were he in the fire, melting to the iron man, the
      backbone of him, it would be different. At his pleasures he is
      anti-hymnic, repellent to song. He has perceived the virtues of Peace,
      without the brother eye for the need of virtuousness to make good use of
      them and inspire the poet. His own enrolled unrhythmical bardic troops
      (humorous mercenaries when Celts) do his trumpeting best, and offend not
      the Pierides.
    </p>
    <p>
      This interlude, or rather inter-drone, repulsive to write, can hardly be
      excluded from a theme dramatising Celtic views, and treating of a blood,
      to which the idea of country must shine resplendently if we would have it
      running at full tide through the arteries. Preserve your worship, if the
      object fills your optics. Better worship that than nothing, as it is
      better for flames to be blown out than not to ascend, otherwise it will
      wreak circular mischief instead of illumining. You are requested simply to
      recollect that there is another beside you who sees the object obliquely,
      and then you will not be surprised by his irreverence. What if, in the
      end, you were conducted to a like point of view? Self-worship, it has been
      said, is preferable to no trimming of the faculty, but worship does not
      necessarily cease with the extinction of this of the voraciously carnal.
      An ideal of country, of Great Britain, is conceivable that will be to the
      taste of Celt and Saxon in common, to wave as a standard over their
      fraternal marching. Let Bull boo his drumliest at such talk: it is, I
      protest, the thing we want and can have. He is the obstruction, not the
      country; and against him, not against the country, the shots are aimed
      which seem so malignant. Him the gay manipulators propitiate who look at
      him through Literature and the Press, and across the pulpit-cushions, like
      airy Macheath at Society, as carrion to batten on. May plumpness be their
      portion, and they never hanged for it! But the flattering, tickling,
      pleasantly pinching of Bull is one of those offices which the simple
      starveling piper regards with afresh access of appetite for the
      well-picked bone of his virtue. That ghastly apparition of the fleshly
      present is revealed to him as a dead whale, having the harpoon of the
      inevitable slayer of the merely fleshly in his oils. To humour him, and be
      his piper for his gifts, is to descend to a carnival deep underneath.
      While he reigns, thinks this poor starveling, Rome burns, or the explosive
      powders are being secretly laid. He and his thousand Macheaths are dancing
      the country the giddy pace, and there will, the wretch dreads, be many a
      crater of scoria in the island, before he stretches his inanimate length,
      his parasites upon him. The theme is chosen and must be treated as a piper
      involved in his virtue conceives it: that is, realistically; not with
      Bull&rsquo;s notion of the realism of the butcher&rsquo;s shop and the pendent legs of
      mutton and blocks of beef painted raw and glaring in their streaks, but
      with the realism of the active brain and heart conjoined. The reasons for
      the division of Celt and Saxon, what they think and say of one another,
      often without knowing that they are divided, and the wherefore of our
      abusing of ourselves, brave England, our England of the ancient fortitude
      and the future incarnation, can afford to hear. Why not in a tale? It is
      he, your all for animal pleasure in the holiday he devours and cannot
      enjoy, whose example teaches you to shun the plaguey tale that carries
      fright: and so you find him sour at business and sick of his relaxings,
      hating both because he harnesses himself in turn bestially to each,
      growling at the smallest admixture of them, when, if he would but chirp a
      little over his work, and allow his pleasures to inspire a dose of
      thoughtfulness, he would be happier, and&mdash;who knows?-become a
      brighter fellow, one to be rescued from the pole-axe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the rain is over, your carriage is at the door, the country smiles and
      the wet highway waves a beckoning hand. We have worn through a cloud with
      cloudy discourses, but we are in a land of shifting weathers, &lsquo;coelum
      crebris imbribus ac nebulis foedum,&rsquo; not every chapter can be sunshine.

      CHAPTER XVII. CROSSING THE RUBICON
    </h2>
    <p>
      Rough weather on the Irish sea discharged a pallid file of passengers from
      the boat at Holyhead just as the morning sun struck wave and mountain with
      one of the sudden sparkling changes which our South-welters have in their
      folds to tell us after a tumultuous night that we have only been worried
      by Puck. The scene of frayed waters all rosy-golden, and golden-banded
      heathery height, with the tinted sand, breaking to flights of blue, was
      resplendent for those of our recent sea-farers who could lift an eye to
      enjoy it. Freshness, illumination, then salt air, vivid distances, were a
      bath for every sense of life. You could believe the breast of the mountain
      to be heaving, the billows to be kissing fingers to him, the rollers
      shattered up the cliff to have run to extinction to scale him. He seemed
      in his clear-edged mass King of this brave new boundless world built in a
      minute out of the wreck of the old.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour back the vessel was labouring through rueful chasms under
      darkness, and then did the tricksy Southwest administer grisly slaps to
      right and left, whizzing spray across the starboard beam, and drenching
      the locks of a young lady who sat cloaked and hooded in frieze to teach
      her wilfulness a lesson, because she would keep her place on deck from
      beginning to end of the voyage. Her faith in the capacity of Irish frieze
      to turn a deluge of the deeps driven by an Atlantic gale was shaken by the
      time she sighted harbour, especially when she shed showers by flapping a
      batlike wing of the cloak, and had a slight shudder to find herself
      trickling within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear! and I&rsquo;m wet to the skin,&rsquo; she confided the fact to herself vocally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would not be advised,&rsquo; a gentleman beside her said after a delicate
      pause to let her impulsive naturalism of utterance fly by unwounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And aren&rsquo;t you the same and worse? And not liking it either, I fear,
      Sir!&rsquo; she replied, for despite a manful smile his complexion was
      tell-tale. &lsquo;But there &lsquo;s no harm in salt. But you should have gone down to
      the cabin with Father Boyle and you would have been sure of not catching
      cold. But, Oh! the beautiful... look at it! And it&rsquo;s my first view of
      England. Well, then, I&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s a beautiful country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her companion looked up at the lighted sky, and down at the pools in
      tarpaulin at his feet. He repressed a disposition to shudder, and with the
      anticipated ecstasy of soon jumping out of wet clothes into dry, he said:
      &lsquo;I should like to be on the top of that hill now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady&rsquo;s eyes flew to the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They say he looks on Ireland; I love him; and his name is Caer Gybi; and
      it was one of our Saints gave him the name, I &lsquo;ve read in books. I&rsquo;ll be
      there before noon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You want to have a last gaze over to Erin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it&rsquo;s to walk and feel the breeze. But I do, though.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you require a little rest?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sure and I&rsquo;ve had it sitting here all night!&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed: the reason for the variation of exercise was conclusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Boyle came climbing up the ladder, uncertain of his legs; he rolled
      and snatched and tottered on his way to them, and accepted the gentleman&rsquo;s
      help of an arm, saying: &lsquo;Thank ye, thank ye, and good morning, Mr.
      Colesworth. And my poor child! what sort of a night has it been above,
      Kathleen?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He said it rather twinkling, and she retorted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What sort of a night has it been below, Father Boyle?&rsquo; Her twinkle was
      livelier than his, compassionate in archness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Purgatory past is good for contemplation, my dear. &lsquo;Tis past, and there&rsquo;s
      the comfort! You did well to be out of that herring-barrel, Mr.
      Colesworth. I hadn&rsquo;t the courage, or I would have burst from it to take a
      ducking with felicity. I haven&rsquo;t thrown up my soul; that&rsquo;s the most I can
      say. I thought myself nigh on it once or twice. And an amazing kind
      steward it was, or I&rsquo;d have counted the man for some one else. Surely &lsquo;tis
      a glorious morning?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Colesworth responded heartily in praise of the morning. He was
      beginning to fancy that he felt the warmth of spring sunshine on his back.
      He flung up his head and sniffed the air, and was very like a horse
      fretful for the canter; so like as to give Miss Kathleen an idea of the
      comparison. She could have rallied him; her laughing eyes showed the
      readiness, but she forbore, she drank the scene. Her face, with the
      threaded locks about forehead and cheeks, and the dark, the blue, the rosy
      red of her lips, her eyes, her hair, was just such a south-western sky as
      April drove above her, the same in colour and quickness; and much of her
      spirit was the same, enough to stand for a resemblance. But who describes
      the spirit? No one at the gates of the field of youth. When Time goes
      reaping he will gather us a sheaf, out of which the picture springs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s our last lurch, glory to the breakwater!&rsquo; exclaimed Father Boyle,
      as the boat pitched finally outside the harbour fence, where a soft calm
      swell received them with the greeting of civilised sea-nymphs. &lsquo;The
      captain&rsquo;ll have a quieter passage across. You may spy him on the pier.
      We&rsquo;ll be meeting him on the landing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he&rsquo;s not in bed, from watching the stars all night,&rsquo; said Miss
      Kathleen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He must have had a fifty-lynx power of sight for that, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They did appear, though, and wonderfully bright,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I saw them
      come out and go in. It&rsquo;s not all cloud when the high wind blows.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You talk like a song, Kathleen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I rattle a throat if I were at home, Father!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! we&rsquo;re in the enemy&rsquo;s country now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Kathleen said she would go below to get the handbags from the
      stewardess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Colesworth&rsquo;s brows had a little darkened over the Rev. Gentleman&rsquo;s
      last remark. He took two or three impatient steps up and down with his
      head bent. &lsquo;Pardon me; I hoped we had come to a better understanding,&rsquo; he
      said. &lsquo;Is it quite fair to the country and to Miss O&rsquo;Donnell to impress on
      her before she knows us that England is the enemy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Habit, Mr. Colesworth, habit! we&rsquo;ve got accustomed to the perspective and
      speak accordingly. There&rsquo;s a breach visible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought you agreed with me that good efforts are being made on our side
      to mend the breach.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir, you have a noble minority at work, no doubt; and I take you for one
      of the noblest, as not objecting to stand next to alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I really thought, judging from our conversation at Mrs. O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s that
      evening, that you were going to hold out a hand and lead your flock to the
      right sort of fellowship with us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To submission to the laws, Mr. Colesworth; &lsquo;tis my duty to do it as
      pastor and citizen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, to more than that, sir. You spoke with friendly warmth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The atmosphere was genial, if you remember the whisky and the fumes of
      our tobacco at one o&rsquo;clock!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall recollect the evening with the utmost pleasure. You were kind
      enough to instruct me in a good many things I shall be sure to profit by.
      I wish I could have spent more time in Ireland. As it is, I like Irishmen
      so well that if the whole land were in revolt I should never call it the
      enemy&rsquo;s country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excellently spoken, Mr. Colesworth,&rsquo; said the priest. &lsquo;We &lsquo;ll hope your
      writings may do service to mend the breach. For there is one, as you know,
      and more &lsquo;s the pity; there&rsquo;s one, and it&rsquo;s wide and deep. As my friend
      Captain Con O&rsquo;Donnell says, it&rsquo;s plain to the naked eye as a pair of
      particularly fat laundry drawers hung out to dry and ballooned in
      extension&mdash;if mayhap you&rsquo;ve ever seen the sight of them in that
      state:&mdash;just held together by a narrow neck of thread or button, and
      stretching away like a corpulent frog in the act of swimming on the wind.
      His comparison touches the sentiment of disunion, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Colesworth had not ever seen such a pair of laundry drawers inflated
      to symbolise the breach between Ireland and England; nor probably, if he
      had, would the sentiment of national disunion have struck his mind: it was
      difficult to him in the description. He considered his Rev. friend to be
      something of a slippery fish, while Father Boyle&rsquo;s opinion of him likewise
      referred him to an elemental substance, of slow movement-earth, in short:
      for he continued to look argumentative after all had been said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or perhaps he threw a coveting eye on sweet Miss Kathleen and had his own
      idea of mending a stitch of the breach in a quite domestic way. If so, the
      Holy Father would have a word to say, let alone Kathleen. The maids of his
      Church do not espouse her foes. For the men it is another matter: that is
      as the case may be. Temporarily we are in cordial intercourse, Mr.
      Colesworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Kathleen returned to deck carrying her bags. The gentleman had to
      descend, and subsequently an amiable dissension arose on the part of the
      young lady and Mr. Colesworth. She, however, yielded one of her bags, and
      he, though doubly laden, was happy. All very transparent to pastoral
      observation, but why should they not be left to their chirruping
      youthfulness? The captain was not in view, and Father Boyle wanted to go
      to bed for refreshment, and Kathleen was an airy gossamer, with a boy
      running after it, not by any means likely to catch it, or to keep it if he
      did. Proceed and trip along, you young ones!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the hotel they heard that Captain Con O&rsquo;Donnell was a snug sleeper
      upstairs. This, the captain himself very soon informed them, had not been
      the kernel of the truth. He had fancied they would not cross the Channel
      on so rattlesome a night, or Kathleen would have had an Irish kiss to
      greet her landing in England. But the cousinly salute was little delayed,
      news of the family in Ireland and England was exchanged, and then Mr.
      Colesworth and the captain bowed to an introduction; and the captain, at
      mention of his name, immediately cried out that Mr. Colesworth might
      perchance be a relative of the highly intelligent admirable lady who had
      undertaken the secretaryship, and by her vast ability got the entire
      management, of Miss Mattock&rsquo;s benevolent institution, and was conducting
      it with such success that it was fast becoming a grief to the generous
      heart of the foundress of the same to find it not only self-paying, but on
      the road to a fortune, inasmuch as it was already an article in the
      decrees of fashion among the nobility and gentry of both sexes in the
      metropolis to have their linen and laces washed at the Mattock laundry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Colesworth said he was the brother of the lady in question, he had
      also the pleasure of an acquaintance with Miss Mattock. He was vehemently
      congratulated on the relationship, which bore witness, the captain armed,
      to a certain hereditary share of brains greatly to be envied: brother of
      Miss Colesworth, a title of distinction in itself! He was congratulated
      not less cordially for his being so fortunate as to know Miss Mattock, one
      of a million.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Con retained the hand of Father Boyle and squeezed it during his
      eulogies, at the same time dispensing nods and winks and sunny sparkles
      upon Kathleen. Mr. Colesworth went upstairs to his room not unflattered.
      The flattery enveloped him in the pleasant sense of a somehow now
      established companionship for the day with a pleasant person from whom he
      did not wish to separate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You made the gentleman&rsquo;s acquaintance, my dear...?&rsquo; said Con.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kathleen answered: &lsquo;He made friends with our Patrick on the Continent, I
      think it was in Germany, and came to us to study the old country, bearing
      a letter from Patrick. He means to be one of their writers on the
      newspapers. He studies everything; he has written books. He called on us
      coming and called on us going and we came over together,&rsquo; said Miss
      Kathleen. &lsquo;But tell me: our Philip?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Books!&rsquo; Con exclaimed. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s hard to discover a man in these days who
      hasn&rsquo;t written books. Oh! Philip! Ease your heart about Philip. They&rsquo;re
      nursing him, round. He was invalided at the right moment for him, no fear.
      I gave him his chance of the last vacant seat up to the last hour, and now
      the die is cast and this time I &lsquo;m off to it. Poor Philip&mdash;yes, yes!
      we &lsquo;re sorry to see him flat all his length, we love him; he&rsquo;s a gallant
      soldier; alive to his duty; and that bludgeon sun of India knocked him
      down, and that fall from his horse finished the business, and there he
      lies. But he&rsquo;ll get up, and he might have accepted the seat and spared me
      my probation: he&rsquo;s not married, I am, I have a wife, and Master Philip
      divides me against my domestic self, he does. But let that be: I serve
      duty too. Not a word to our friend up yonder. It&rsquo;s a secret with a
      time-fuse warranted to explode safe enough when the minutes are up, and
      make a powerful row when it does. It is all right over there, Father
      Boyle, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A walk over! a pure ceremonial,&rsquo; said the priest, and he yawned
      frightfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re for a nap to recompose you, my dear friend,&rsquo; remarked the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you haven&rsquo;t confided anything of it to Mrs. Adister?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a syllable; no. That&rsquo;s to come. There&rsquo;s my contest! I had urgent
      business in Ireland, and she &lsquo;s a good woman, always willing to let me go.
      I count on her kindness, there &lsquo;s no mightier compliment to one&rsquo;s wife.
      She&rsquo;ll know it when it&rsquo;s history. She&rsquo;s fond of history. Ay, she hates
      fiction, and so I&rsquo;m proud to tell her I offer her none. She likes a
      trifling surprise too, and there she has it. Oh! we can whip up the
      business to a nice little bowl of froth-flummery. But it&rsquo;s when the
      Parliamentary voting is on comes the connubial pull. She&rsquo;s a good woman, a
      dear good soul, but she&rsquo;s a savage patriot; and Philip might have saved
      his kinsman if he had liked. He had only to say the word: I could have
      done all the business for him, and no contest to follow by my fireside.
      He&rsquo;s on his couch&mdash;Mars convalescent: a more dreadful attraction to
      the ladies than in his crimson plumes! If the fellow doesn&rsquo;t let slip his
      opportunity! with his points of honour and being an Irish Bayard. Why
      Bayard in the nineteenth century&rsquo;s a Bedlamite, Irish or no. So I tell
      him. There he is; you&rsquo;ll see him, Kathleen: and one of them as big an
      heiress as any in England. Philip&rsquo;s no fool, you&rsquo;ll find.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then he&rsquo;s coming all right, is he?&rsquo; said Kathleen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He &lsquo;s a soldier, and a good one, but he &lsquo;s nothing more, and as for
      patriotic inflammation, doesn&rsquo;t know the sensation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! but he&rsquo;s coming round, and you&rsquo;ll go and stroke down mother with
      that,&rsquo; Kathleen cried. &lsquo;Her heart&rsquo;s been heavy, with Patrick wandering and
      Philip on his back. I&rsquo;ll soon be dressed for breakfast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Away she went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s got an appetite, and looks like a strapped bit of steel after the
      night&rsquo;s tumbling,&rsquo; said the captain, seeing her trip aloft. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m young as
      that too, or not far off it. Stay, I&rsquo;ll order breakfast for four in a
      quiet corner where we can converse&mdash;which, by the way, won&rsquo;t be
      possible in the presence of that gaping oyster of a fellow, who looks as
      if he were waiting the return of the tide.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Boyle interposed his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not for...&rsquo; he tried to add &lsquo;four.&rsquo; The attempt at a formation of the
      word produced a cavernous yawn a volume of the distressful deep to the
      beholder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; Captain Con assented. He proposed bed and a sedative therein,
      declaring that his experience overnight could pronounce it good, and that
      it should be hot. So he led his tired old friend to the bedroom, asked
      dozens of questions, flurried a withdrawal of them, suggested the answers,
      talked of his Rubicon, praised his wife, delivered a moan on her behalf,
      and after assisting to half disrobe the scarce animate figure, which lent
      itself like an artist&rsquo;s lay-model to the operation, departed on his
      mission of the sedative.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the breakfast for three he was able to tell Kathleen that the worthy
      Father was warm, and on his way to complete restoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Full fathom five the Father lies, in the ocean of sleep, by this time,&rsquo; 
      said Con. &lsquo;And &lsquo;tis a curious fact that every man in that condition seems
      enviable to men on their legs. And similarly with death; we&rsquo;d rather not,
      because of a qualm, but the picture of the finish of the leap across is a
      taking one. These chops are done as if Nature had mellowed their
      juiciness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are so nice,&rsquo; Kathleen said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You deserve them, if ever girl in this world!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I sat on deck all night, and Mr. Colesworth would keep me company.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He could hardly do less, having the chance. But that notwithstanding, I&rsquo;m
      under an obligation to your cavalier. And how did you find Ireland, sir?
      You&rsquo;ve made acquaintance with my cousin, young Mr. Patrick O&rsquo;Donnell, I
      rejoice to hear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, through his hearing or seeing my name and suspecting I had a
      sister,&rsquo; said Mr. Colesworth, who was no longer in the resemblance of a
      gaping oyster on the borders of the ebb. &lsquo;The country is not disturbed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So the doctor thinks his patient is doing favourably! And you cottoned to
      Patrick? And I don&rsquo;t wonder. Where was it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We met in Trieste. He was about to start by one of the Austrian boats for
      the East.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not disturbed! no! with a rotten potato inside it paralysing digestion!&rsquo; 
      exclaimed Con. &lsquo;Now Patrick had been having a peep at Vienna, hadn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He had; he was fresh from Vienna when I met him. As to Ireland, the
      harvest was only middling good last year.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that&rsquo;s the bit of luck we depend on. A cloud too much, and it&rsquo;s
      drowned! Had he seen, do you know, anybody in Vienna?&mdash;you were not
      long together at Trieste?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Colesworth had sufficient quickness to perceive that the two questions
      could be answered as one, and saying: &lsquo;He was disappointed,&rsquo; revealed that
      he and Patrick had been long enough together to come to terms of intimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure, he gave you a letter of introduction to his family!&rsquo; said
      Con. &lsquo;And permit me to add, that Patrick&rsquo;s choice of a friend is mine on
      trust. The lady he was for seeing, Mr. Colesworth, was just then embarking
      on an adventure of a romantic character, particularly well suited to her
      nature, and the end of it was a trifle sanguinary, and she suffered a
      disappointment also, though not perhaps on that account.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I heard of it in England last year,&rsquo; said Mr. Colesworth. &lsquo;Did she come
      through it safely?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Without any personal disfigurement: and is in England now, under her
      father&rsquo;s roof, meditating fresh adventures.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Kathleen cried: &lsquo;Ye &lsquo;re talking of the lady who was Miss Adister&mdash;I
      can guess&mdash;Ah!&rsquo; She humped her shoulders and sent a shudder up her
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But she&rsquo;s a grand creature, Mr. Colesworth, and you ought to know her,&rsquo; 
      said Con. &lsquo;That is, if you&rsquo;d like to have an idea of a young Catherine or
      a Semiramisminus an army and a country. There&rsquo;s nothing she&rsquo;s not capable
      of aiming at. And there&rsquo;s pretty well nothing and nobody she wouldn&rsquo;t make
      use of. She has great notions of the power of the British Press and the
      British purse&mdash;each in turn as a key to the other. Now for an egg,
      Kathleen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;ll eat an egg,&rsquo; Kathleen replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless the honey heart of the girl! Life&rsquo;s in you, my dear, and calls for
      fuel. I&rsquo;m glad to see that Mr. Colesworth too can take a sight at the
      Sea-God after a night of him. It augurs magnificently for a future career.
      And let me tell you that the Pen demands it of us. The first of the
      requisites is a stout stomach&mdash;before a furnished head! I&rsquo;d not pass
      a man to be anything of a writer who couldn&rsquo;t step ashore from a tempest
      and consume his Titan breakfast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are qualifying for the literary craft, Miss O&rsquo;Donnell,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Colesworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s for a walk in the wind up Caer Gybi, and along the coast I mean to
      go,&rsquo; said Kathleen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This morning?&rsquo; the captain asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw his dilemma in his doubtful look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I&rsquo;ve done. While you&rsquo;re discussing matters with Father Boyle. I&mdash;know
      you&rsquo;re burning to. Sure it&rsquo;s yourself knows as well as anybody, Captain
      Con, that I can walk a day long and take care of my steps. I&rsquo;ve walked the
      better half of Donegal alone, and this morning I&rsquo;ll have a protector.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Con eyed the protector, approved of him, disapproved of himself,
      thought of Kathleen as a daughter of Erin&mdash;a privileged and inviolate
      order of woman in the minds of his countrymen&mdash;and wriggling
      internally over a remainder scruple said: &lsquo;Mr. Colesworth mayhap has to
      write a bit in the morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m unattached at present,&rsquo; the latter said. &lsquo;I am neither a
      correspondent nor a reporter, and if I were, the event would be wanting.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That remark, sir, shows you to be eminently a stranger to the official
      duties,&rsquo; observed the captain. &lsquo;Journalism is a maw, and the journalist
      has to cram it, and like anything else which perpetually distends for
      matter, it must be filled, for you can&rsquo;t leave it gaping, so when nature
      and circumstance won&rsquo;t combine to produce the stuff, we have recourse to
      the creative arts. &lsquo;Tis the necessity of the profession.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The profession will not impose that necessity upon me,&rsquo; remarked the
      young practitioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Outside the wheels of the machine, sir, we indulge our hallucination of
      immunity. I&rsquo;ve been one in the whirr of them, relating what I hadn&rsquo;t quite
      heard, and capitulating what I didn&rsquo;t think at all, in spite of the cry of
      my conscience&mdash;a poor infant below the waters, casting up ejaculatory
      bubbles of protestation. And if it is my reproach that I left it to the
      perils of drowning, it&rsquo;s my pride that I continued to transmit air enough
      to carry on the struggle. Not every journalist can say as much. The Press
      is the voice of the mass, and our private opinion is detected as a discord
      by the mighty beast, and won&rsquo;t be endured by him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s better not to think of him quite as a beast,&rsquo; said Mr. Colesworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Infinitely better: and I like your &ldquo;guile,&rdquo; sir: But wait and tell me
      what you think of him after tossing him his meat for a certain number of
      years. There&rsquo;s Rockney. Do you know Rockney? He&rsquo;s the biggest single gun
      they&rsquo;ve got, and he&rsquo;s mad for this country, but ask him about the public,
      you&rsquo;ll hear the menagerie-keeper&rsquo;s opinion of the brute that mauled his
      loins.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rockney,&rsquo; said Mr. Colesworth, &lsquo;has the tone of a man disappointed of the
      dictatorship.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you do know Rockney!&rsquo; shouted Captain Con. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the man in a neat
      bit of drawing. He&rsquo;s a grand piece of ordnance. But wait for him too, and
      tell me by and by. If it isn&rsquo;t a woman, you&rsquo;ll find, that primes him, ay,
      and points him, and what&rsquo;s more, discharges him, I&rsquo;m not Irish born. Poor
      fellow! I pity him. He had a sweet Irish lady for his wife, and lost her
      last year, and has been raging astray politically ever since. I suppose
      it&rsquo;s hardly the poor creature&rsquo;s fault. None the less, you know, we have to
      fight him. And now he &lsquo;s nibbling at a bait&mdash;it &lsquo;s fun: the lady I
      mentioned, with a turn for adventure and enterprise: it&rsquo;s rare fun: he &lsquo;s
      nibbling, he&rsquo;ll be hooked. You must make her acquaintance, Mr. Colesworth,
      and hold your own against her, if you can. She&rsquo;s a niece of my wife&rsquo;s and
      I&rsquo;ll introduce you. I shall find her in London, or at our lodgings at a
      Surrey farm we&rsquo;ve taken to nurse my cousin Captain Philip O&rsquo;Donnell
      invalided from Indian awful climate!&mdash;on my return, when I hope to
      renew the acquaintance. She has beauty, she has brains. Resist her, and
      you &lsquo;ll make a decent stand against Lucifer. And supposing she rolls you
      up and pitches you over, her noticing you is a pretty compliment to your
      pen. That &lsquo;ll be consoling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Colesworth fancied, he said, that he was proof against feminine
      blandishments in the direction of his writings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke as one indicating a thread to suggest a cable. The captain
      applauded the fancy as a pleasing delusion of the young sprigs of
      Journalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, Mr. Colesworth, with all respect for French intelligence,
      denied the conclusiveness of French generalisations, which ascribed to
      women universal occult dominion, and traced all great affairs to small
      intrigues.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain&rsquo;s eyes twinkled on him, thinking how readily he would back
      smart Miss Kathleen to do the trick, if need were.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said to her before she started: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t forget he may be a clever fellow
      with that pen of his, and useful to our party.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not forget,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the good of his party, then, Captain Con permitted her to take the
      walk up Caer Gybi alone with Mr. Colesworth: a memorable walk in the
      recollections of the scribe, because of the wonderful likeness of the
      young lady to the breezy weather and the sparkles over the deep, the cloud
      that frowned, the cloud that glowed, the green of the earth greening out
      from under wings of shadow, the mountain ranges holding hands about an
      immensity of space. It was one of our giant days to his emotions, and
      particularly memorable to him through the circumstance that it insisted on
      a record in verse, and he was unused to the fetters of metre: and although
      the verse was never seen by man, his attempt at it confused his ideas of
      his expressive powers. Oddly too, while scourging the lines with
      criticism, he had a fondness for them: they stamped a radiant day in his
      mind, beyond the resources of rhetoric to have done it equally.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the day of Captain Con&rsquo;s crossing the Rubicon between the secret
      of his happiness and a Parliamentary career.

      CHAPTER XVIII. CAPTAIN CON&rsquo;S LETTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Women may be able to tell you why the nursing of a military invalid
      awakens tenderer anxieties in their bosoms than those called forth by the
      drab civilian. If we are under sentence of death we are all of us pathetic
      of course; but stretched upon the debateable couch of sickness we are not
      so touching as the coloured coat: it has the distinction belonging to
      colour. It smites a deeper nerve, or more than one; and this, too, where
      there is no imaginary subjection to the charms of military glory, in minds
      to which the game of war is lurid as the plumes of the arch-slayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane Mattock assisting Mrs. Adister O&rsquo;Donnell to restore Captain Philip
      was very singularly affected, like a person shut off on a sudden from her
      former theories and feelings. Theoretically she despised the soldier&rsquo;s
      work as much as she shrank abhorrently from bloodshed. She regarded him
      and his trappings as an ensign of our old barbarism, and could peruse
      platitudes upon that theme with enthusiasm. The soldier personally, she
      was accustomed to consider an inferior intelligence: a sort of schoolboy
      when young, and schoolmaster when mature a visibly limited creature, not a
      member of our broader world. Without dismissing any of these views she
      found them put aside for the reception of others of an opposite character;
      and in her soul she would have ascribed it to her cares of nursing that
      she had become thoughtful, doubtful, hopeful, even prayerful, surcharged
      with zeal, to help to save a good sword for the country. If in a world
      still barbarous we must have soldiers, here was one whom it would be
      grievous to lose. He had fallen for the country; and there was a moving
      story of how he had fallen. She inclined to think more highly of him for
      having courted exposure on a miserable frontier war where but a poor sheaf
      of glory could be gathered. And he seemed to estimate his professional
      duties apart from an aim at the laurels. A conception of the possibility
      of a man&rsquo;s being both a soldier and morally a hero edged its way into her
      understanding. It stood edgeways within, desirous of avoiding a challenge
      to show every feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cares of nursing were Jane&rsquo;s almost undividedly, except for the aid
      she had from her friend Grace Barrow and from Miss Colesworth. Mrs.
      Adister O&rsquo;Donnell was a nurse in name only. &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll be seen by Philip like
      as if she were a nightmare apparition of his undertaker&rsquo;s wraith,&rsquo; Captain
      Con said to Jane, when recommending his cousin to her charitable nature,
      after he had taken lodgings at a farmhouse near Mrs. Lackstraw&rsquo;s model
      farm Woodside on the hills. &lsquo;Barring the dress,&rsquo; as he added, some such
      impression of her frigid mournfulness might have struck a recumbent
      invalid. Jane acknowledged it, and at first induced her aunt to join her
      in the daily walk of half a mile to sit with him. Mrs. Lackstraw was a
      very busy lady at her farm; she was often summoned to London by her
      intuition of John&rsquo;s wish to have her presiding at table for the
      entertainment of his numerous guests; she confessed that she supervised
      the art of nursing better than she practised it, and supervision can be
      done at a distance if the subordinate is properly attentive to the rules
      we lay down, as Jane appeared to be. So Jane was left to him. She loved
      the country; Springtide in the country set her singing; her walk to her
      patient at Lappett&rsquo;s farm and homeward was an aethereal rapture for a
      heart rocking easy in fulness. There was nothing to trouble it, no hint of
      wild winds and heavy seas, not even the familiar insinuation from the
      vigilant monitress, her aunt, to bid her be on her guard, beware of what
      it is that great heiresses are courted for, steel her heart against
      serpent speeches, see well to have the woman&rsquo;s precious word No at the
      sentinel&rsquo;s post, and alert there. Mrs. Lackstraw, the most vigilant and
      plain-spoken of her sex, had forborne to utter the usual warnings which
      were to preserve Miss Mattock for her future Earl or Duke and the reason
      why she forbore was a double one; a soldier and Papist could never be
      thought perilous to a young woman scorning the sons of Mars and slaves of
      sacerdotalism. The picture of Jane bestowing her hand on a Roman Catholic
      in military uniform, refused to be raised before the mind. Charitableness,
      humaneness, the fact that she was an admirable nurse and liked to exercise
      her natural gift, perfectly accounted for Jane&rsquo;s trips to Lappett&rsquo;s farm,
      and the jellies and fresh dairy dainties and neat little dishes she was
      constantly despatching to the place. A suggestion of possible danger might
      prove more dangerous than silence, by rendering it attractive. Besides,
      Jane talked of poor Captain Philip as Patrick O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s brother, whom
      she was bound to serve in return for Patrick&rsquo;s many services to her; and
      of how unlike Patrick he was. Mrs. Lackstraw had been apprehensive about
      her fancy for Patrick. Therefore if Captain Philip was unlike him, and
      strictly a Catholic, according to report, the suspicion of danger
      dispersed, and she was allowed to enjoy the pleasures of the metropolis as
      frequently as she chose. The nursing of a man of Letters, or of the
      neighbour to him, a beggar in rags, would not have been so tolerated. Thus
      we perceive that wits actively awake inside the ring-fence of
      prepossessions they have erected may lull themselves with their
      wakefulness. Who would have thought!&mdash;is the cry when the strongest
      bulwark of the fence is broken through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane least of any would have thought what was coming to pass. The pale
      square-browed young officer, so little Irish and winning in his brevity of
      speech, did and said nothing to alarm her or strike the smallest light.
      Grace Barrow noticed certain little changes of mood in Jane she could
      scarcely have had a distinct suspicion at the time. After a recent
      observation of him, on an evening stroll from Lappett&rsquo;s to Woodside, she
      pronounced him interesting, but hard. &lsquo;He has an interesting head... I
      should not like to offend him.&rsquo; They agreed as to his unlikeness to fluid
      Patrick; both eulogistic of the absent brother; and Jane, who could be
      playful in privacy with friends, clapped a brogue on her tongue to
      discourse of Patrick and apostrophise him: &lsquo;Oh! Pat, Pat, my dear cousin
      Pat! why are you so long away from your desponding Jane? I &lsquo;ll take to
      poetry and write songs, if you don&rsquo;t come home soon. You&rsquo;ve put seas
      between us, and are behaving to me as an enemy. I know you &lsquo;ll bring home
      a foreign Princess to break the heart of your faithful. But I&rsquo;ll always
      praise you for a dear boy, Pat, and wish you happy, and beg the good
      gentleman your brother to give me a diploma as nurse to your first-born.
      There now!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She finished smiling brightly, and Grace was a trifle astonished, for her
      friend&rsquo;s humour was not as a rule dramatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You really have caught a twang of it from your friend Captain Con; only
      you don&rsquo;t rattle the eighteenth letter of the alphabet in the middle of
      words.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve tried, and can&rsquo;t persuade my tongue to do it &ldquo;first off,&rdquo; as boys
      say, and my invalid has no brogue whatever to keep me in practice,&rsquo; Jane
      replied. &lsquo;One wonders what he thinks of as he lies there by the window. He
      doesn&rsquo;t confide it to his hospital nurse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he would treat her courteously, just in that military style,&rsquo; said
      Grace, realising the hospital attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It &lsquo;s the style I like best:&mdash;no perpetual personal thankings and
      allusions to the trouble he gives!&rsquo; Jane exclaimed. &lsquo;He shows perfect good
      sense, and I like that in all things, as you know. A red-haired young
      woman chooses to wait on him and bring him flowers&mdash;he&rsquo;s brother to
      Patrick in his love of wild flowers, at all events!&mdash;and he takes it
      naturally and simply. These officers bear illness well. I suppose it &lsquo;s
      the drill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Still I think it a horrid profession, dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace felt obliged to insist on that: and her &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; though it was not
      stressed, tickled Jane&rsquo;s dormant ear to some drowsy wakefulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think too much honour is paid to it, certainly. But soldiers, of all
      men, one would expect to be overwhelmed by a feeling of weakness. He has
      never complained; not once. I doubt if he would have complained if Mrs.
      Adister had been waiting on him all the while, or not a soul. I can
      imagine him lying on the battle-field night after night quietly, resolving
      not to groan.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too great a power of self-repression sometimes argues the want of any
      emotional nature,&rsquo; said Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane shook her head. She knew a story of him contradicting that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story had not recurred to her since she had undertaken her service. It
      coloured the remainder of an evening walk home through the beechwoods and
      over the common with Grace, and her walk across the same tracks early in
      the morning, after Grace had gone to London. Miss Colesworth was coming to
      her next week, with her brother if he had arrived in England. Jane
      remembered having once been curious about this adventurous man of Letters
      who lived by the work of his pen. She remembered comparing him to one who
      was compelled to swim perpetually without a ship to give him rest or land
      in view. He had made a little money by a book, and was expending it on
      travels&mdash;rather imprudently, she fancied Emma Colesworth to be
      thinking. He talked well, but for the present she was happier in her
      prospect of nearly a week of loneliness. The day was one of sunshine,
      windless, odorous: one of the rare placid days of April when the pettish
      month assumes a matronly air of summer and wears it till the end of the
      day. The beech twigs were strongly embrowned, the larches shot up green
      spires by the borders of woods and on mounds within, deep ditchbanks
      unrolled profuse tangles of new blades, and sharp eyes might light on a
      late white violet overlooked by the children; primroses ran along the
      banks. Jane had a maxim that flowers should be spared to live their life,
      especially flowers of the wilds; she had reared herself on our poets;
      hence Mrs. Lackstraw&rsquo;s dread of the arrival of one of the minstrel order:
      and the girl, who could deliberately cut a bouquet from the garden, if
      requested, would refuse to pluck a wildflower. But now they cried out to
      her to be plucked in hosts, they claimed the sacrifice, and it seemed to
      her no violation of her sentiment to gather handfuls making a bunch that
      would have done honour to the procession of the children&rsquo;s May-day&mdash;a
      day she excused for the slaughter because her idol and prophet among the
      poets, wild nature&rsquo;s interpreter, was that day on the side of the
      children. How like a bath of freshness would the thick faintly-fragrant
      mass shine to her patient! Only to look at it was medicine! She believed,
      in her lively healthfulness, that the look would give him a spring to
      health, and she hurried forward to have them in water-the next sacred
      obligation to the leaving of them untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had reared herself on our poets. If much brooding on them will
      sometimes create a sentimentalism of the sentiment they inspire, that
      also, after our manner of developing, leads to finer civilisation; and as
      her very delicate feelings were not always tyrants over her clear and
      accurate judgement, they rather tended to stamp her character than lead
      her into foolishness. Blunt of speech, quick in sensibility, imaginative,
      yet idealistic, she had the complex character of diverse brain and nerve,
      and was often a problem to the chief person interested in it. She thought
      so decisively, felt so shrinkingly; spoke so flatly, brooded so softly!
      Such natures, in the painful effort to reconcile apparent antagonism and
      read themselves, forget that they are not full grown. Longer than others
      are they young: but meanwhile they are of an age when we are driven abroad
      to seek and shape our destinies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing through the garden-gate of Lappett&rsquo;s farm she made her way to the
      south-western face of the house to beg a bowl of water of the farmer&rsquo;s
      wife, and had the sweet surprise of seeing her patient lying under
      swallows&rsquo; eaves on a chair her brother had been commissioned to send from
      London for coming uses. He was near the farm-wife&rsquo;s kitchen, but to
      windward of the cooking-reek, pleasantly warmed, sufficiently shaded, and
      alone, with open letter on the rug covering his legs. He whistled to
      Jane&rsquo;s dog Wayland, a retriever, having Newfoundland relationships, of
      smithy redness and ruggedness; it was the whistle that startled her to
      turn and see him as she was in the act of handing Mrs. Lappett her
      primroses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Out? I feared it would be a week. Is it quite prudent?&rsquo; Jane said, toning
      down her delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered with the half-smile that refers these questions to the settled
      fact. Air had always brought him round; now he could feel he was embarked
      for recovery: and he told her how the farmer and one of his men had lent a
      shoulder to present him to his old and surest physician&mdash;rather like
      a crippled ghost. M. Adister was upstairs in bed with one of her
      headaches. Captain Con, then, was attending her, Jane supposed: She spoke
      of him as the most devoted of husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight hardening of Philip&rsquo;s brows, well-known to her by this time,
      caused her to interrogate his eyes. They were fixed on her in his manner
      of gazing with strong directness. She read the contrary opinion, and some
      hieroglyphic matter besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We all respect him for his single-hearted care of her,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I have
      a great liking for him. His tirades about the Saxon tyrant are not worth
      mentioning, they mean nothing. He would be one of the first to rush to the
      standard if there were danger; I know he would. He is truly chivalrous, I
      am sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip&rsquo;s broad look at her had not swerved. The bowl of primroses placed
      beside him on a chair by the farmer&rsquo;s dame diverted it for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You gathered them?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane drank his look at the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, on my way,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;We can none of us live for ever; and fresh
      water every day will keep them alive a good long time. They had it from
      the clouds yesterday. Do they not seem a bath of country happiness!&rsquo; 
      Evidently they did their service in pleasing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing his fingers grope on the rug, she handed him his open letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      He selected the second, passing under his inspection, and asked her to
      read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the letter, wondering a little that it should be in Captain Con&rsquo;s
      handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am to read it through?&rsquo; she said, after a run over some lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. She thought it a sign of his friendliness in sharing family
      secrets with her, and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MY DEAR PHILIP,&mdash;Not a word of these contents, which will be
      delivered seasonably to the lady chiefly concerned, by the proper person.
      She hears this morning I &lsquo;m off on a hasty visit to Ireland, as I have
      been preparing her of late to expect I must, and yours the blame, if any,
      though I will be the last to fling it at you. I meet Father B. and pretty
      Kitty before I cross. Judging by the wind this morning, the passage will
      furnish good schooling for a spell of the hustings. But if I am in the
      nature of things unable to command the waves, trust me for holding a mob
      in leash; and they are tolerably alike. My spirits are up. Now the die is
      cast. My election to the vacancy must be reckoned beforehand. I promise
      you a sounding report from the Kincora Herald. They will not say of me
      after that (and read only the speeches reported in the local paper) &ldquo;what
      is the man but an Irish adventurer!&rdquo; He is a lover of his country, Philip
      O&rsquo;Donnell, and one of millions, we will hope. And that stigmatic title of
      long standing, more than anything earthly, drove him to the step-to the
      ruin of his domestic felicity perhaps. But we are past sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think you, when he crossed the tide, Caius Julius Caesar sighed?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, nor thought of his life, nor his wife, but of the thing to be done.
      Laugh, my boy! I know what I am about when I set my mind on a powerful
      example. As the chameleon gets his colour, we get our character from the
      objects we contemplate...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane glanced over the edge of the letter sheet rosily at Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      His dryness in hitting the laughable point diverted her, and her mind
      became suffused with a series of pictures of the chameleon captain planted
      in view of the Roman to become a copy of him, so that she did not peruse
      the terminating lines with her wakefullest attention:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The liege lady of my heart will be the earliest to hail her hero
      triumphant, or cherish him beaten&mdash;which is not in the prospect. Let
      Ireland be true to Ireland. We will talk of the consolidation of the Union
      by and by. You are for that, you say, when certain things are done; and
      you are where I leave you, on the highway, though seeming to go at a
      funeral pace to certain ceremonies leading to the union of the two
      countries in the solidest fashion, to their mutual benefit, after a
      shining example. Con sleeps with a corner of the eye open, and you are not
      the only soldier who is a strategist, and a tactician too, aware of when
      it is best to be out of the way. Now adieu and pax vobiscum. Reap the rich
      harvest of your fall to earth. I leave you in the charge of the kindest of
      nurses, next to the wife of my bosom the best of women. Appreciate her,
      sir, or perish in my esteem. She is one whom not to love is to be guilty
      of an offence deserving capital punishment, and a bastinado to season the
      culprit for his execution. Have I not often informed her myself that a
      flower from her hand means more than treasures from the hands of others.
      Expect me absent for a week. The harangues will not be closely reported. I
      stand by the truth, which is my love of the land of my birth. A wife must
      come second to that if she would be first in her husband&rsquo;s consideration.
      Hurrah me on, Philip, now it is action, and let me fancy I hear you
      shouting it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The drop of the letter to the signature fluttered affectionately on a
      number of cordial adjectives, like the airy bird to his home in the corn.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. MARS CONVALESCENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jane&rsquo;s face was clear as the sky when she handed the letter back to
      Philip. In doing so, it struck her that the prolonged directness of his
      look was peculiar: she attributed it to some effect of the fresh Spring
      atmosphere on a weakened frame. She was guessing at his reasons for
      showing her the letter, and they appeared possibly serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An election to Parliament! Perhaps Mrs. Adister should have a hint of it,
      to soften the shock I fear it may be: but we must wait till her headache
      has passed,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You read to the end?&rsquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Captain Con always amuses me, and I am bound to confess I have no
      positive disrelish of his compliments. But this may prove a desperate
      step. The secret of his happiness is in extreme jeopardy. Nothing would
      stop him, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip signified that it was too late. He was moreover of opinion, and
      stated it in his briefest, that it would be advisable to leave the
      unfolding of the present secret to the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane wondered why the letter had been shown. Her patient might be annoyed
      and needing sympathy?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After all,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;Captain Con may turn out to be a very good sort of
      member of Parliament in his way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip&rsquo;s eyebrows lifted, and he let fall a breath, eloquent of his
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My brother says he is a serviceable director of the Company they are
      associated in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He finds himself among reasonable men, and he is a chameleon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Parliament may steady him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is too much of a platform for Con&rsquo;s head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, there is more of poet than politician,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;That is a danger.
      But he calls himself our friend; I think he really has a liking for John
      and me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For you he has a real love,&rsquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, he may listen to us at times; he may be trusted not to wound
      us. I am unmitigatedly for the one country&mdash;no divisions. We want all
      our strength in these days of monstrous armies directed by banditti
      Councils. England is the nation of the Christian example to nations. Oh!
      surely it is her aim. At least she strives to be that. I think it, and I
      see the many faults we have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her patient&rsquo;s eyelids were down.
    </p>
    <p>
      She proposed to send her name up to Mrs. Adister.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her return from the poor lady racked with headache and lying little
      conscious of her husband&rsquo;s powder-barrel under the bed, Jane found her
      patient being worried by his official nurse, a farm-labourer&rsquo;s wife, a
      bundle of a woman, whose lumbering assiduities he fenced with reiterated
      humourous negatives to every one of her propositions, until she prefaced
      the last two or three of the list with a &lsquo;Deary me!&rsquo; addressed
      consolatorily to herself. She went through the same forms each day, at the
      usual hours of the day, and Jane, though she would have felt the apathetic
      doltishness of the woman less, felt how hard it must be for him to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your sister will be with you soon,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I am glad, and yet I hope
      you will not allow her to put me aside altogether?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall do as you wish,&rsquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is she like Patrick? Her name is Kathleen, I know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is a raw Irish girl, of good Irish training, but Irish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope she will be pleased with England. Like Patrick in face, I mean.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We think her a good-looking girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does she play? sing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some of our ballads.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She will delight my brother. John loves Irish ballads.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence of long duration fell between them. She fancied he would like to
      sleep, and gently rose to slip away, that she might consult with Mrs.
      Lappett about putting up some tentcover. He asked her if she was going.
      &lsquo;Not home,&rsquo; she said. His hand moved, but stopped. It seemed to have meant
      to detain her. She looked at a white fleece that came across the sun,
      desiring to conjure it to stay and shadow him. It sailed by. She raised
      her parasol.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyelids were shut, and she thought him asleep. Meditating on her
      unanswered question of Miss Kathleen&rsquo;s likeness to Patrick, Jane imagined
      a possibly greater likeness to her patient, and that he did not speak of
      his family&rsquo;s exclamations on the subject because of Kathleen&rsquo;s being so
      good-looking a girl. For if good-looking, a sister must resemble these
      handsome features here, quiescent to inspection in their marble outlines
      as a corse. So might he lie on the battle-field, with no one to watch over
      him!
    </p>
    <p>
      While she watched, sitting close beside him to shield his head from the
      sunbeams, her heart began to throb before she well knew the secret of it.
      She had sight of a tear that grew big under the lashes of each of his
      eyelids, and rolled heavily. Her own eyes overflowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fit of weeping was momentary, April&rsquo;s, a novelty with her. She accused
      her silly visions of having softened her. A hasty smoothing to right and
      left removed the traces; they were unseen; and when she ventured to look
      at him again there was no sign of fresh drops falling. His eyelids kept
      shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrival of her diurnal basket of provisions offered a refreshing
      intervention of the commonplace. Bright air had sharpened his appetite: he
      said he had been sure it would, and anticipated cheating the doctor of a
      part of the sentence which condemned him to lie on his back up to the
      middle of June, a log. Jane was hungry too, and they feasted together
      gaily, talking of Kathleen on her journey, her strange impressions and her
      way of proclaiming them, and of Patrick and where he might be now;
      ultimately of Captain Con and Mrs. Adister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has broken faith with her,&rsquo; Philip said sternly. &lsquo;She will have the
      right to tell him so. He never can be anything but a comic politician.
      Still he was bound to consult his wife previous to stepping before the
      public. He knows that he married a fortune.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A good fortune,&rsquo; said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip acquiesced. &lsquo;She is an excellent woman, a model of uprightness; she
      has done him all the good in the world, and here is he deceiving her,
      lying&mdash;there is no other word: and one lie leads to another. When he
      married a fortune he was a successful adventurer. The compact was
      understood. His duty as a man of honour is to be true to his bond and
      serve the lady. Falseness to his position won&rsquo;t wash him clean of the
      title.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane pleaded for Captain Con. &lsquo;He is chivalrously attentive to her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have read his letter,&rsquo; Philip replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crushed her charitable apologies with references to the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are not certain that Mrs. Adister will object,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you see her reading a speech of her husband&rsquo;s?&rsquo; he remarked. Presently
      with something like a moan:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I am her guest!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! pray, do not think Mrs. Adister will ever allow you to feel the
      lightest shadow...&rsquo; said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; that makes it worse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Had this been the burden of his thoughts when those two solitary tears
      forced their passage?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly: not even in his physical weakness would he consent to weep for
      such a cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I forgot to mention that Mrs. Adister has a letter from her husband
      telling her he has been called over to Ireland on urgent business,&rsquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip answered: &lsquo;He is punctilious.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish indeed he had been more candid,&rsquo; Jane assented to the sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In Ireland he is agreeably surprised by the flattering proposal of a
      vacant seat, and not having an instant to debate on it, assumes the
      consent of the heavenliest wife in Christendom.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip delivered the speech with a partial imitation of Captain Con
      addressing his wife on his return as the elected among the pure Irish
      party. The effort wearied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She supposed he was regretting his cousin&rsquo;s public prominence in the ranks
      of the malcontents. &lsquo;He will listen to you,&rsquo; she said, while she smiled at
      his unwonted display of mimicry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A bad mentor for him. Antics are harmless, though they get us laughed
      at,&rsquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may restrain him from excesses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Were I in that position, you would consider me guilty of greater than any
      poor Con is likely to commit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely you are not for disunion?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The reverse. I am for union on juster terms, that will hold it fast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what are the terms?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have desired to paint himself as black to her as possible. He
      stated the terms, which were hardly less than the affrighting ones blown
      across the Irish sea by that fierce party. He held them to be just, simply
      sensible terms. True, he spoke of the granting them as a sure method to
      rally all Ireland to an ardent love of the British flag. But he praised
      names of Irish leaders whom she had heard Mr. Rockney denounce for
      disloyal insolence: he could find excuses for them and their dupes&mdash;poor
      creatures, verily! And his utterances had a shocking emphasis. Then she
      was not wrong in her idea of the conspirator&rsquo;s head, her first impression
      of him!
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not quit the theme: doing that would have been to be
      indifferent: something urged her to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are they really your opinions?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed relieved by declaring that they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Patrick is quite free of them,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will hope that the Irish fever will spare Patrick. He was at a Jesuit
      college in France when he was wax. Now he&rsquo;s taking the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With so little of the Jesuit in him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Little of the worst: a good deal of the best.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the best?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Their training to study. They train you to concentrate the brain upon the
      object of study. And they train you to accept service: they fit you for
      absolute service: they shape you for your duties in the world; and so long
      as they don&rsquo;t smelt a man&rsquo;s private conscience, they are model masters.
      Happily Patrick has held his own. Not the Jesuits would have a chance of
      keeping a grasp on Patrick! He&rsquo;ll always be a natural boy and a thoughtful
      man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane&rsquo;s features implied a gentle shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shake a scarlet cloak to you?&rsquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was directed by his words to think of the scarlet coat. &lsquo;I reflect a
      little on the substance of things as well,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Would not Patrick&rsquo;s
      counsels have an influence?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hitherto our Patrick has never presumed to counsel his elder brother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But an officer wearing...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The uniform! That would have to be stripped off. There&rsquo;d be an end to any
      professional career.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would not regret it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No sorrow is like a soldier&rsquo;s bidding farewell to flag and comrades.
      Happily politics and I have no business together. If the country favours
      me with active service I&rsquo;m satisfied for myself. You asked me for my
      opinions: I was bound to give them. Generally I let them rest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Could she have had the temerity? Jane marvelled at herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She doubted that the weighty pair of tears had dropped for the country.
      Captain Con would have shed them over Erin, and many of them. Captain
      Philip&rsquo;s tone was too plain and positive: he would be a most practical
      unhistrionic rebel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would countenance a revolt?&rsquo; she said, striking at that extreme to
      elicit the favourable answer her tones angled for. And it was instantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not in arms.&rsquo; He tried an explanation by likening the dissension to a
      wrangle in a civilised family over an unjust division of property.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here, as he was marking the case with some nicety and difficulty, an
      itinerant barrel-organ crashed its tragic tale of music put to torture at
      the gate. It yelled of London to Jane, throttled the spirits of the woods,
      threw a smoke over the country sky, befouled the pure air she loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instrument was one of the number which are packed to suit all English
      tastes and may be taken for a rough sample of the jumble of them, where a
      danceless quadrille-tune succeeds a suicidal Operatic melody and is
      followed by the weariful hymn, whose last drawl pert polka kicks aside.
      Thus does the poor Savoyard compel a rich people to pay for their wealth.
      Not without pathos in the abstract perhaps do the wretched machines pursue
      their revolutions of their factory life, as incapable of conceiving as of
      bestowing pleasure: a bald cry for pennies through the barest pretence to
      be agreeable but Jane found it hard to be tolerant of them out of London,
      and this one affecting her invalid and Mrs. Adister must be dismissed.
      Wayland was growling; he had to be held by the collar. He spied an
      objectionable animal. A jerky monkey was attached to the organ; and his
      coat was red, his kepi was blue; his tailor had rigged him as a military
      gentleman. Jane called to the farm-wife. Philip assured her he was not
      annoyed. Jane observed him listening, and by degrees she distinguished a
      maundering of the Italian song she had one day sung to Patrick in his
      brother&rsquo;s presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I remember your singing that the week before I went to India,&rsquo; said
      Philip, and her scarlet blush flooded her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you endure the noise?&rsquo; she asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Con would say it shrieks &ldquo;murder.&rdquo; But I used to like it once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lappett came answering to the call. Her children were seen up the
      garden setting to one another with squared aprons, responsive to a
      livelier measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless me, miss, we think it so cheerful!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Lappett, and glanced
      at her young ones harmonious and out of mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Jane, always considerate for children. She had forgotten
      the racked Mrs. Adister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the hymn of Puritanical gloom-the peacemaker with Providence
      performing devotional exercises in black bile. The leaps of the children
      were dashed. A sallow two or three minutes composed their motions, and
      then they jumped again to the step for lively legs. The similarity to the
      regimental band heading soldiers on the march from Church might have
      struck Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder when I shall see Patrick!&rsquo; he said, quickened in spite of
      himself by the sham sounds of music to desire changes and surprises.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane was wondering whether he could be a man still to brood tearfully over
      his old love.
    </p>
    <p>
      She echoed him. &lsquo;And I! Soon, I hope.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of Mrs. Adister with features which were the acutest
      critical summary of the discord caused toll to be paid instantly, and they
      beheld a flashing of white teeth and heard Italian accents. The monkey
      saluted militarily, but with painful suggestions of his foregone drilling
      in the ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are safe nowhere from these intrusions,&rsquo; Mrs. Adister said; &lsquo;not on
      these hills!&mdash;and it must be a trial for the wretched men to climb
      them, that thing on their backs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are as accustomed to it as mountain smugglers bearing packs of
      contraband,&rsquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Con would have argued him out of hearing before he ground a second note,&rsquo; 
      she resumed. &lsquo;I have no idea when Con returns from his unexpected visit to
      Ireland.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Within a fortnight, madam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me believe it! You have heard from him? But you are in the air!
      exposed! My head makes me stupid. It is now five o&rsquo;clock. The air begins
      to chill. Con will never forgive me if you catch a cold, and I would not
      incur his blame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of Jane and Philip shot an exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anything you command, madam,&rsquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up and breathed his heaven of fresh air. Jane pitied, she could
      not interpose to thwart his act of resignation. The farmer, home for tea,
      and a footman, took him between them, crutched, while Mrs. Adister said to
      Jane: &lsquo;The doctor&rsquo;s orders are positive:&mdash;if he is to be a man once
      more, he must rest his back and not use his legs for months. He was near
      to being a permanent cripple from that fall. My brother Edward had one
      like it in his youth. Soldiers are desperate creatures.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think Mr. Adister had his fall when hunting, was it not?&rsquo; said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hunting, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That was rather different from a fall on duty before the enemy, incurred
      by severe exhaustion after sunstroke!...
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane took her leave of Philip beside his couch of imprisonment in his
      room, promising to return in the early morning. He embraced her old dog
      Wayland tenderly. Hard men have sometimes a warm affection for dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking homeward she likewise gave Wayland a hug. She called him &lsquo;dear old
      fellow,&rsquo; and questioned him of his fondness for her, warning him not to be
      faithless ever to the mistress who loved him. Was not her old Wayland as
      good a protector as the footman Mrs. Adister pressed her to have at her
      heels? That he was!
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Con&rsquo;s behaviour grieved her. And it certainly revived an ancient
      accusation against his countrymen. If he cared for her so much, why had he
      not placed confidence in her and commissioned her to speak of his election
      to his wife? Irishmen will never be quite sincere!&mdash;But why had his
      cousin exposed him to one whom he greatly esteemed? However angry he might
      be with Con O&rsquo;Donnell in his disapproval of the captain&rsquo;s conduct, it was
      not very considerate to show the poor man to her in his natural colours.
      Those words: &lsquo;The consolidation of the Union:&rsquo; sprang up. She had a dim
      remembrance of words ensuing: &lsquo;ceremonies going at a funeral pace... on
      the highway to the solidest kind of union:&rsquo;&mdash;Yes, he wrote: &lsquo;I leave
      you to...&rsquo; And Captain Philip showed her the letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      She perceived motives beginning to stir. He must have had his intention:
      and now as to his character!&mdash;Jane was of the order of young women
      possessing active minds instead of figured paste-board fronts, who see
      what there is to be seen about them and know what may be known instead of
      decorously waiting for the astonishment of revelations. As soon as she had
      asked herself the nature of the design of so honourable a man as Captain
      Philip in showing her his cousin&rsquo;s letter, her blood spun round and round,
      waving the reply as a torch; and the question of his character confirmed
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But could he be imagined seeking to put her on her guard? There may be
      modesty in men well aware of their personal attractions: they can credit
      individual women with powers of resistance. He was not vain to the degree
      which stupefies the sense of there being weight or wisdom in others. And
      he was honour&rsquo;s own. By these lights of his character she read the act.
      His intention was... and even while she saw it accurately, the moment of
      keen perception was overclouded by her innate distrust of her claim to
      feminine charms. For why should he wish her to understand that he was no
      fortune-hunter and treated heiresses with greater reserve than ordinary
      women! How could it matter to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw the tears roll. Tears of men sink plummet-deep; they find their
      level. The tears of such a man have more of blood than of water in them.&mdash;What
      was she doing when they fell? She was shading his head from the sun. What,
      then, if those tears came of the repressed desire to thank her with some
      little warmth? He was honour&rsquo;s own, and warmhearted Patrick talked of him
      as a friend whose heart was, his friend&rsquo;s. Thrilling to kindness, and,
      poor soul! helpless to escape it, he felt perhaps that he had never
      thanked her, and could not. He lay there, weak and tongue-tied: hence
      those two bright volumes of his condition of weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the pursuit of the mystery ended, as it had commenced, in confusion,
      but of a milder sort and partially transparent at one or two of the gates
      she had touched. A mind capable of seeing was twisted by a nature that
      would not allow of open eyes; yet the laden emotions of her nature brought
      her round by another channel to the stage neighbouring sight, where facts,
      dimly recognised for such&mdash;as they may be in truth, are accepted
      under their disguises, because disguise of them is needed by the bashful
      spirit which accuses itself of audaciousness in presuming to speculate.
      Had she asked herself the reason of her extended speculation, her foot
      would not have stopped more abruptly on the edge of a torrent than she on
      that strange road of vapours and flying lights. She did not; she sang, she
      sent her voice through the woods and took the splendid ring of it for an
      assurance of her peculiarly unshackled state. She loved this liberty. Of
      the men who had &lsquo;done her the honour,&rsquo; not one had moved her to regret the
      refusal. She lived in the hope of simply doing good, and could only give
      her hand to a man able to direct and help her; one who would bear to be
      matched with her brother. Who was he? Not discoverable; not likely to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore she had her freedom, an absolutely unflushed freedom, happier
      than poor Grace Barrow&rsquo;s. Rumour spoke of Emma Colesworth having a wing
      clipped. How is it that sensible women can be so susceptible? For, thought
      Jane, the moment a woman is what is called in love, she can give her heart
      no longer to the innocent things about her; she is cut away from Nature:
      that pure well-water is tasteless to her. To me it is wine!
    </p>
    <p>
      The drinking of the pure well-water as wine is among the fatal signs of
      fire in the cup, showing Nature at work rather to enchain the victim than
      bid her daughter go. Jane of course meant the poet&rsquo;s &lsquo;Nature.&rsquo; She did not
      reflect that the strong glow of poetic imagination is wanted to hallow a
      passionate devotion to the inanimate for this evokes the spiritual; and
      passionateness of any kind in narrower brains should be a proclamation to
      us of sanguine freshets not coming from a spiritual source. But the heart
      betraying deluded her. She fancied she had not ever been so wedded to
      Nature as on that walk through the bursting beechwoods, that sweet lonely
      walk, perfect in loneliness, where even a thought of a presence was thrust
      away as a desecration and images of souls in thought were shadowy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lust of freedom gave her the towering holiday. She took the delirium
      in her own pure fashion, in a love of the bankside flowers and the downy
      edges of the young beech-buds fresh on the sprays. And it was no unreal
      love, though too intent and forcible to win the spirit from the object.
      She paid for this indulgence of her mood by losing the spirit entirely. At
      night she was a spent rocket. What had gone she could not tell: her very
      soul she almost feared. Her glorious walk through the wood seemed burnt
      out. She struck a light to try her poet on the shelf of the elect of earth
      by her bed, and she read, and read flatness. Not his the fault! She
      revered him too deeply to lay it on him. Whose was it? She had a vision of
      the gulfs of bondage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could it be possible that human persons were subject to the spells of
      persons with tastes, aims, practices, pursuits alien to theirs? It was a
      riddle taxing her to solve it for the resistance to a monstrous iniquity
      of injustice, degrading her conception of our humanity. She attacked it in
      the abstract, as a volunteer champion of our offended race. And Oh! it
      could not be. The battle was won without a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon came glimpses of the gulfs of bondage, delicious, rose-enfolded,
      foreign; they were chapters of soft romance, appearing interminable, an
      endless mystery, an insatiable thirst for the mystery. She heard crashes
      of the opera-melody, and despising it even more than the wretched engine
      of the harshness, she was led by it, tyrannically led a captive, like the
      organ-monkey, until perforce she usurped the note, sounded the cloying
      tune through her frame, passed into the vulgar sugariness, lost herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And saying to herself: This is what moves them! she was moved. One thrill
      of appreciation drew her on the tide, and once drawn from shore she became
      submerged. Why am I not beautiful, was her thought. Those voluptuous
      modulations of melting airs are the natural clothing of beautiful women.
      Beautiful women may believe themselves beloved. They are privileged to
      believe, they are born with the faith.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
