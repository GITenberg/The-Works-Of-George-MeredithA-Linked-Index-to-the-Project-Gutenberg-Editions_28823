    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. I AM A SUBJECT OF CONTENTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      One midnight of a winter month the sleepers in Riversley Grange were
      awakened by a ringing of the outer bell and blows upon the great
      hall-doors. Squire Beltham was master there: the other members of the
      household were, his daughter Dorothy Beltham; a married daughter Mrs.
      Richmond; Benjamin Sewis, an old half-caste butler; various domestic
      servants; and a little boy, christened Harry Lepel Richmond, the squire&rsquo;s
      grandson. Riversley Grange lay in a rich watered hollow of the Hampshire
      heath-country; a lonely circle of enclosed brook and pasture, within view
      of some of its dependent farms, but out of hail of them or any dwelling
      except the stables and the head-gardener&rsquo;s cottage. Traditions of
      audacious highwaymen, together with the gloomy surrounding fir-scenery,
      kept it alive to fears of solitude and the night; and there was that in
      the determined violence of the knocks and repeated bell-peals which
      assured all those who had ever listened in the servants&rsquo; hall to
      prognostications of a possible night attack, that the robbers had come at
      last most awfully. A crowd of maids gathered along the upper corridor of
      the main body of the building: two or three footmen hung lower down, bold
      in attitude. Suddenly the noise ended, and soon after the voice of old
      Sewis commanded them to scatter away to their beds; whereupon the footmen
      took agile leaps to the post of danger, while the women, in whose bosoms
      intense curiosity now supplanted terror, proceeded to a vacant room
      overlooking the front entrance, and spied from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Sewis stood by his master&rsquo;s bedside. The squire was a hunter, of
      the old sort: a hard rider, deep drinker, and heavy slumberer. Before
      venturing to shake his arm Sewis struck a light and flashed it over the
      squire&rsquo;s eyelids to make the task of rousing him easier. At the first
      touch the squire sprang up, swearing by his Lord Harry he had just dreamed
      of fire, and muttering of buckets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sewis! you&rsquo;re the man, are you: where has it broken out?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir; no fire,&rsquo; said Sewis; &lsquo;you be cool, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cool, sir! confound it, Sewis, haven&rsquo;t I heard a whole town of steeples
      at work? I don&rsquo;t sleep so thick but I can hear, you dog! Fellow comes
      here, gives me a start, tells me to be cool; what the deuce! nobody hurt,
      then? all right!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire had fallen back on his pillow and was relapsing to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sewis spoke impressively: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a gentleman downstairs; a gentleman
      downstairs, sir. He has come rather late.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentleman downstairs come rather late.&rsquo; The squire recapitulated the
      intelligence to possess it thoroughly. &lsquo;Rather late, eh? Oh! Shove him
      into a bed, and give him hot brandy and water, and be hanged to him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sewis had the office of tempering a severely distasteful announcement to
      the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He resumed: &lsquo;The gentleman doesn&rsquo;t talk of staying. That is not his
      business. It &lsquo;s rather late for him to arrive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rather late!&rsquo; roared the squire. &lsquo;Why, what&rsquo;s it o&rsquo;clock?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching a hand to the watch over his head, he caught sight of the
      unearthly hour. &lsquo;A quarter to two? Gentleman downstairs? Can&rsquo;t be that
      infernal apothecary who broke &lsquo;s engagement to dine with me last night? By
      George, if it is I&rsquo;ll souse him; I&rsquo;ll drench him from head to heel as
      though the rascal &lsquo;d been drawn through the duck-pond. Two o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning? Why, the man&rsquo;s drunk. Tell him I&rsquo;m a magistrate, and I&rsquo;ll commit
      him, deuce take him; give him fourteen days for a sot; another fourteen
      for impudence. I&rsquo;ve given a month &lsquo;fore now. Comes to me, a Justice of the
      peace!&mdash;man &lsquo;s mad! Tell him he&rsquo;s in peril of a lunatic asylum. And
      doesn&rsquo;t talk of staying? Lift him out o&rsquo; the house on the top o&rsquo; your
      boot, Sewis, and say it &lsquo;s mine; you &lsquo;ve my leave.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sewis withdrew a step from the bedside. At a safe distance he fronted his
      master steadily; almost admonishingly. &lsquo;It &lsquo;s Mr. Richmond, sir,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr....&rsquo; The squire checked his breath. That was a name never uttered at
      the Grange. &lsquo;The scoundrel?&rsquo; he inquired harshly, half in a tone of one
      assuring himself, and his rigid dropped jaw shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact had to be denied or affirmed instantly, and Sewis was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grasping his bedclothes in a lump, the squire cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Downstairs? downstairs, Sewis? You&rsquo;ve admitted him into my house?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is not in the house, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have! How did you speak to him, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Out of my window, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What place here is the scoundrel soiling now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is on the doorstep outside the house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Outside, is he? and the door&rsquo;s locked?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let him rot there!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the midnight visitor&rsquo;s patience had become exhausted. A
      renewal of his clamour for immediate attention fell on the squire&rsquo;s ear,
      amazing him to stupefaction at such challengeing insolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hand me my breeches,&rsquo; he called to Sewis; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t think brisk out of my
      breeches.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sewis held the garment ready. The squire jumped from the bed, fuming
      speechlessly, chafing at gaiters and braces, cravat and coat, and allowed
      his buttons to be fitted neatly on his calves; the hammering at the
      hall-door and plucking at the bell going on without intermission. He wore
      the aspect of one who assumes a forced composure under the infliction of
      outrages on his character in a Court of Law, where he must of necessity
      listen and lock his boiling replies within his indignant bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Sewis, now my horsewhip,&rsquo; he remarked, as if it had been a simple
      adjunct of his equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your hat, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My horsewhip, I said.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your hat is in the hall,&rsquo; Sewis observed gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I asked you for my horsewhip.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is not to be found anywhere,&rsquo; said Sewis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire was diverted from his objurgations against this piece of
      servitorial defiance by his daughter Dorothy&rsquo;s timid appeal for permission
      to come in. Sewis left the room. Presently the squire descended, fully
      clad, and breathing sharply from his nostrils. Servants were warned off
      out of hearing; none but Sewis stood by.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire himself unbolted the door, and threw it open to the limit of
      the chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A response followed promptly from outside: &lsquo;I take you to be Mr. Harry
      Lepel Beltham. Correct me if I err. Accept my apologies for disturbing you
      at a late hour of the night, I pray.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is plain Augustus Fitz-George Roy Richmond at this moment, Mr. Beltham.
      You will recognize me better by opening your door entirely: voices are
      deceptive. You were born a gentleman, Mr. Beltham, and will not reduce me
      to request you to behave like one. I am now in the position, as it were,
      of addressing a badger in his den. It is on both sides unsatisfactory. It
      reflects egregious discredit upon you, the householder.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire hastily bade Sewis see that the passages to the sleeping
      apartments were barred, and flung the great chain loose. He was acting
      under strong control of his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a quiet grey night, and as the doors flew open, a largely-built
      man, dressed in a high-collared great-coat and fashionable hat of the
      time, stood clearly defined to view. He carried a light cane, with the
      point of the silver handle against his under lip. There was nothing
      formidable in his appearance, and his manner was affectedly affable. He
      lifted his hat as soon as he found himself face to face with the squire,
      disclosing a partially bald head, though his whiskering was luxuriant, and
      a robust condition of manhood was indicated by his erect attitude and the
      immense swell of his furred great-coat at the chest. His features were
      exceedingly frank and cheerful. From his superior height, he was enabled
      to look down quite royally on the man whose repose he had disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following conversation passed between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You now behold who it is, Mr. Beltham, that acknowledges to the
      misfortune of arousing you at an unseemly hour&mdash;unbetimes, as our
      gossips in mother Saxon might say&mdash;and with profound regret, sir,
      though my habit is to take it lightly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you any accomplices lurking about here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What &lsquo;s your business?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have no business to be here, no. I ask you what &lsquo;s the object of your
      visit?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Permit me first to speak of the cause of my protracted arrival, sir. The
      ridicule of casting it on the post-boys will strike you, Mr. Beltham, as
      it does me. Nevertheless, I must do it; I have no resource. Owing to a
      rascal of the genus, incontinent in liquor, I have this night walked seven
      miles from Ewling. My complaint against him is not on my own account.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What brought you here at all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you ask me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ask you what brought you to my house at all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True, I might have slept at Ewling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For the reason, Mr. Beltham, which brought me here originally. I could
      not wait-not a single minute. So far advanced to the neighbourhood, I
      would not be retarded, and I came on. I crave your excuses for the hour of
      my arrival. The grounds for my coming at all you will very well
      understand, and you will applaud me when I declare to you that I come to
      her penitent; to exculpate myself, certainly, but despising
      self-justification. I love my wife, Mr. Beltham. Yes; hear me out, sir. I
      can point to my unhappy star, and say, blame that more than me. That star
      of my birth and most disastrous fortunes should plead on my behalf to you;
      to my wife at least it will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve come to see my daughter Marian, have you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My wife, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t cross my threshold while I live.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You compel her to come out to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She stays where she is, poor wretch, till the grave takes her. You&rsquo;ve
      done your worst; be off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Beltham, I am not to be restrained from the sight of my wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Scamp!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By no scurrilous epithets from a man I am bound to respect will I be
      deterred or exasperated.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Damned scamp, I say!&rsquo; The squire having exploded his wrath gave it free
      way. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve stopped my tongue all this while before a scoundrel &lsquo;d
      corkscrew the best-bottled temper right or left, go where you will one end
      o&rsquo; the world to the other, by God! And here &lsquo;s a scoundrel stinks of
      villany, and I&rsquo;ve proclaimed him &lsquo;ware my gates as a common trespasser,
      and deserves hanging if ever rook did nailed hard and fast to my barn
      doors! comes here for my daughter, when he got her by stealing her,
      scenting his carcase, and talking &lsquo;bout his birth, singing what not sort
      o&rsquo; foreign mewin&rsquo; stuff, and she found him out a liar and a beast, by God!
      And she turned home. My doors are open to my flesh and blood. And here she
      halts, I say, &lsquo;gainst the law, if the law&rsquo;s against me. She&rsquo;s crazed:
      you&rsquo;ve made her mad; she knows none of us, not even her boy. Be off;
      you&rsquo;ve done your worst; the light&rsquo;s gone clean out in her; and hear me,
      you Richmond, or Roy, or whatever you call yourself, I tell you I thank
      the Lord she has lost her senses. See her or not, you &lsquo;ve no hold on her,
      and see her you shan&rsquo;t while I go by the name of a man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Richmond succeeded in preserving an air of serious deliberation under
      the torrent of this tremendous outburst, which was marked by scarce a
      pause in the delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said, &lsquo;My wife deranged! I might presume it too truly an inherited
      disease. Do you trifle with me, sir? Her reason unseated! and can you
      pretend to the right of dividing us? If this be as you say&mdash;Oh! ten
      thousand times the stronger my claim, my absolute claim, to cherish her.
      Make way for me, Mr. Beltham. I solicit humbly the holiest privilege
      sorrow can crave of humanity. My wife! my wife! Make way for me, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His figure was bent to advance. The squire shouted an order to Sewis to
      run round to the stables and slip the dogs loose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it your final decision?&rsquo; Mr. Richmond asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Damn your fine words! Yes, it is. I keep my flock clear of a foul sheep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Beltham, I implore you, be merciful. I submit to any conditions: only
      let me see her. I will walk the park till morning, but say that an
      interview shall be granted in the morning. Frankly, sir, it is not my
      intention to employ force: I throw myself utterly on your mercy. I love
      the woman; I have much to repent of. I see her, and I go; but once I must
      see her. So far I also speak positively.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak as positively as you like,&rsquo; said the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the laws of nature and the laws of man, Marian Richmond is mine to
      support and comfort, and none can hinder me, Mr. Beltham; none, if I
      resolve to take her to myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t they!&rsquo; said the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A curse be on him, heaven&rsquo;s lightnings descend on him, who keeps husband
      from wife in calamity!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire whistled for his dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if wounded to the quick by this cold-blooded action, Mr. Richmond stood
      to his fullest height.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor, sir, on my application during to-morrow&rsquo;s daylight shall I see her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor, sir, on your application&rsquo;&mdash;the squire drawled in uncontrollable
      mimicking contempt of the other&rsquo;s florid forms of speech, ending in his
      own style,&mdash;&lsquo;no, you won&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You claim a paternal right to refuse me: my wife is your child. Good. I
      wish to see my son.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On that point the squire was equally decided. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s asleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I insist.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense: I tell you he&rsquo;s a-bed and asleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I repeat, I insist.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When the boy&rsquo;s fast asleep, man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The boy is my flesh and blood. You have spoken for your daughter&mdash;I
      speak for my son. I will see him, though I have to batter at your doors
      till sunrise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Some minutes later the boy was taken out of his bed by his aunt Dorothy,
      who dressed him by the dark window-light, crying bitterly, while she said,
      &lsquo;Hush, hush!&rsquo; and fastened on his small garments between tender huggings
      of his body and kissings of his cheeks. He was told that he had nothing to
      be afraid of. A gentleman wanted to see him: nothing more. Whether the
      gentleman was a good gentleman, and not a robber, he could not learn but
      his aunt Dorothy, having wrapped him warm in shawl and comforter, and
      tremblingly tied his hat-strings under his chin, assured him, with
      convulsive caresses, that it would soon be over, and he would soon be
      lying again snug and happy in his dear little bed. She handed him to Sewis
      on the stairs, keeping his fingers for an instant to kiss them: after
      which, old Sewis, the lord of the pantry, where all sweet things were
      stored, deposited him on the floor of the hall, and he found himself
      facing the man of the night. It appeared to him that the stranger was of
      enormous size, like the giants of fairy books: for as he stood a little
      out of the doorway there was a peep of night sky and trees behind him, and
      the trees looked very much smaller, and hardly any sky was to be seen
      except over his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire seized one of the boy&rsquo;s hands to present him and retain him at
      the same time: but the stranger plucked him from his grandfather&rsquo;s hold,
      and swinging him high, exclaimed, &lsquo;Here he is! This is Harry Richmond. He
      has grown a grenadier.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kiss the little chap and back to bed with him,&rsquo; growled the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy was heartily kissed and asked if he had forgotten his papa. He
      replied that he had no papa: he had a mama and a grandpapa. The stranger
      gave a deep groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see what you have done; you have cut me off from my own,&rsquo; he said
      terribly to the squire; but tried immediately to soothe the urchin with
      nursery talk and the pats on the shoulder which encourage a little boy to
      grow fast and tall. &lsquo;Four years of separation,&rsquo; he resumed, &lsquo;and my son
      taught to think that he has no father. By heavens! it is infamous, it is a
      curst piece of inhumanity. Mr. Beltham, if I do not see my wife, I carry
      off my son.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may ask till you&rsquo;re hoarse, you shall never see her in this house
      while I am here to command,&rsquo; said the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well; then Harry Richmond changes homes. I take him. The affair is
      concluded.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You take him from his mother?&rsquo; the squire sang out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You swear to me she has lost her wits; she cannot suffer. I can. I shall
      not expect from you, Mr. Beltham, the minutest particle of comprehension
      of a father&rsquo;s feelings. You are earthy; you are an animal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire saw that he was about to lift the boy, and said, &lsquo;Stop, never
      mind that. Stop, look at the case. You can call again to-morrow, and you
      can see me and talk it over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I see my wife?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, you shan&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You remain faithful to your word, sir, do you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I do similarly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! Stop! Not to take a child like that out of a comfortable house at
      night in Winter, man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the night is temperate and warm; he shall not remain in a house where
      his father is dishonoured.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop! not a bit of it,&rsquo; cried the squire. &lsquo;No one speaks of you. I give
      you my word, you &lsquo;re never mentioned by man, woman or child in the house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Silence concerning a father insinuates dishonour, Mr. Beltham.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Damn your fine speeches, and keep your blackguardly hands off that boy,&rsquo; 
      the squire thundered. &lsquo;Mind, if you take him, he goes for good. He doesn&rsquo;t
      get a penny from me if you have the bringing of him up. You&rsquo;ve done for
      him, if you decide that way. He may stand here a beggar in a stolen coat
      like you, and I won&rsquo;t own him. Here, Harry, come to me; come to your
      grandad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Richmond caught the boy just when he was turning to run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That gentleman,&rsquo; he said, pointing to the squire, &lsquo;is your grandpapa. I
      am your papa. You must learn at any cost to know and love your papa. If I
      call for you to-morrow or next day they will have played tricks with Harry
      Richmond, and hid him. Mr. Beltham, I request you, for the final time, to
      accord me your promise observe, I accept your promise&mdash;that I shall,
      at my demand, to-morrow or the next day, obtain an interview with my
      wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire coughed out an emphatic &lsquo;Never!&rsquo; and fortified it with an oath
      as he repeated it upon a fuller breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir, I will condescend to entreat you to grant this permission,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Richmond, urgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, never: I won&rsquo;t!&rsquo; rejoined the squire, red in the face from a fit of
      angry coughing. &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t; but stop, put down that boy; listen to me, you
      Richmond! I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do. I &lsquo;ll&mdash;if you swear on a Bible,
      like a cadger before a bench of magistrates, you&rsquo;ll never show your face
      within a circuit o&rsquo; ten miles hereabouts, and won&rsquo;t trouble the boy if you
      meet him, or my daughter or me, or any one of us-hark ye, I&rsquo;ll do this:
      let go the boy, and I&rsquo;ll give ye five hundred&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give ye a cheque
      on my banker for a thousand pounds; and, hark me out, you do this, you
      swear, as I said, on the servants&rsquo; Bible, in the presence of my butler and
      me, &ldquo;Strike you dead as Ananias and t&rsquo; other one if you don&rsquo;t keep to it,&rdquo;
       do that now, here, on the spot, and I&rsquo;ll engage to see you paid fifty
      pounds a year into the bargain. Stop! and I&rsquo;ll pay your debts under two or
      three hundred. For God&rsquo;s sake, let go the boy! You shall have fifty
      guineas on account this minute. Let go the boy! And your son&mdash;there,
      I call him your son&mdash;your son, Harry Richmond, shall inherit from me;
      he shall have Riversley and the best part of my property, if not every bit
      of it. Is it a bargain? Will you swear? Don&rsquo;t, and the boy&rsquo;s a beggar,
      he&rsquo;s a stranger here as much as you. Take him, and by the Lord, you ruin
      him. There now, never mind, stay, down with him. He&rsquo;s got a cold already;
      ought to be in his bed; let the boy down!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You offer me money,&rsquo; Mr. Richmond answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is one of the indignities belonging to a connection with a man like
      you. You would have me sell my son. To see my afflicted wife I would
      forfeit my heart&rsquo;s yearnings for my son; your money, sir, I toss to the
      winds; and I am under the necessity of informing you that I despise and
      loathe you. I shrink from the thought of exposing my son to your besotted
      selfish example. The boy is mine; I have him, and he shall traverse the
      wilderness with me. By heaven! his destiny is brilliant. He shall be
      hailed for what he is, the rightful claimant of a place among the proudest
      in the land; and mark me, Mr. Beltham, obstinate sensual old man that you
      are! I take the boy, and I consecrate my life to the duty of establishing
      him in his proper rank and station, and there, if you live and I live, you
      shall behold him and bow your grovelling pig&rsquo;s head to the earth, and
      bemoan the day, by heaven! when you,&mdash;a common country squire, a man
      of no origin, a creature with whose blood we have mixed ours&mdash;and he
      is stone-blind to the honour conferred on him&mdash;when you in your
      besotted stupidity threatened to disinherit Harry Richmond.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The door slammed violently on such further speech as he had in him to
      utter. He seemed at first astonished; but finding the terrified boy about
      to sob, he drew a pretty box from one of his pockets and thrust a
      delicious sweetmeat between the whimpering lips. Then, after some moments
      of irresolution, during which he struck his chest soundingly and gazed
      down, talked alternately to himself and the boy, and cast his eyes along
      the windows of the house, he at last dropped on one knee and swaddled the
      boy in the folds of the shawl. Raising him in a business-like way, he
      settled him on an arm and stepped briskly across gravel-walk and lawn,
      like a horse to whose neck a smart touch of the whip has been applied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soft mild night had a moon behind it somewhere; and here and there a
      light-blue space of sky showed small rayless stars; the breeze smelt fresh
      of roots and heath. It was more a May-night than one of February. So
      strange an aspect had all these quiet hill-lines and larch and fir-tree
      tops in the half-dark stillness, that the boy&rsquo;s terrors were overlaid and
      almost subdued by his wonderment; he had never before been out in the
      night, and he must have feared to cry in it, for his sobs were not loud.
      On a rise of the park-road where a fir-plantation began, he heard his name
      called faintly from the house by a woman&rsquo;s voice that he knew to be his
      aunt Dorothy&rsquo;s. It came after him only once: &lsquo;Harry Richmond&rsquo;; but he was
      soon out of hearing, beyond the park, among the hollows that run dipping
      for miles beside the great highroad toward London. Sometimes his father
      whistled to him, or held him high and nodded a salutation to him, as
      though they had just discovered one another; and his perpetual
      accessibility to the influences of spicy sugarplums, notwithstanding his
      grief, caused his father to prognosticate hopefully of his future wisdom.
      So, when obedient to command he had given his father a kiss, the boy fell
      asleep on his shoulder, ceasing to know that he was a wandering infant:
      and, if I remember rightly, he dreamed he was in a ship of cinnamon-wood
      upon a sea that rolled mighty, but smooth immense broad waves, and tore
      thing from thing without a sound or a hurt.

      CHAPTER II. AN ADVENTURE ON MY OWN ACCOUNT
    </h2>
    <p>
      That night stands up without any clear traces about it or near it, like
      the brazen castle of romance round which the sea-tide flows. My father
      must have borne me miles along the road; he must have procured food for
      me; I have an idea of feeling a damp forehead and drinking new milk, and
      by-and-by hearing a roar of voices or vehicles, and seeing a dog that went
      alone through crowded streets without a master, doing as he pleased, and
      stopping every other dog he met. He took his turning, and my father and I
      took ours. We were in a house that, to my senses, had the smell of dark
      corners, in a street where all the house-doors were painted black, and
      shut with a bang. Italian organ-men and milk-men paraded the street
      regularly, and made it sound hollow to their music. Milk, and no cows
      anywhere; numbers of people, and no acquaintances among them; my thoughts
      were occupied by the singularity of such things.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father could soon make me forget that I was transplanted; he could act
      dog, tame rabbit, fox, pony, and a whole nursery collection alive, but he
      was sometimes absent for days, and I was not of a temper to be on friendly
      terms with those who were unable to captivate my imagination as he had
      done. When he was at home I rode him all round the room and upstairs to
      bed, I lashed him with a whip till he frightened me, so real was his
      barking; if I said &lsquo;Menagerie&rsquo; he became a caravan of wild beasts; I undid
      a button of his waistcoat, and it was a lion that made a spring, roaring
      at me; I pulled his coat-tails and off I went tugging at an old bear that
      swung a hind leg as he turned, in the queerest way, and then sat up and
      beating his breast sent out a mew-moan. Our room was richer to me than all
      the Grange while these performances were going forward. His monkey was
      almost as wonderful as his bear, only he was too big for it, and was
      obliged to aim at reality in his representation of this animal by means of
      a number of breakages; a defect that brought our landlady on the scene.
      The enchantment of my father&rsquo;s companionship caused me to suffer
      proportionately in his absence. During that period of solitude, my
      nursemaid had to order me to play, and I would stumble about and squat in
      the middle of the floor, struck suddenly by the marvel of the difference
      between my present and my other home. My father entered into arrangements
      with a Punch and Judy man for him to pay me regular morning visits
      opposite our window; yet here again his genius defeated his kind
      intentions; for happening once to stand by my side during the progress of
      the show, he made it so vivid to me by what he said and did, that I saw no
      fun in it without him: I used to dread the heralding crow of Punch if he
      was away, and cared no longer for wooden heads being knocked ever so hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sundays we walked to the cathedral, and this was a day with a delight
      of its own for me. He was never away on the Sunday. Both of us attired in
      our best, we walked along the streets hand in hand; my father led me
      before the cathedral monuments, talking in a low tone of British
      victories, and commending the heroes to my undivided attention. I
      understood very early that it was my duty to imitate them. While we
      remained in the cathedral he talked of glory and Old England, and dropped
      his voice in the middle of a murmured chant to introduce Nelson&rsquo;s name or
      some other great man&rsquo;s and this recurred regularly. &lsquo;What are we for now?&rsquo; 
      he would ask me as we left our house. I had to decide whether we took a
      hero or an author, which I soon learnt to do with capricious resolution.
      We were one Sunday for Shakespeare; another for Nelson or Pitt. &lsquo;Nelson,
      papa,&rsquo; was my most frequent rejoinder, and he never dissented, but turned
      his steps toward Nelson&rsquo;s cathedral dome, and uncovered his head there,
      and said: &lsquo;Nelson, then, to-day&rsquo;; and we went straight to his monument to
      perform the act of homage. I chose Nelson in preference to the others
      because near bed-time in the evening my father told me stories of our hero
      of the day, and neither Pitt nor Shakespeare lost an eye, or an arm, or
      fought with a huge white bear on the ice to make himself interesting. I
      named them occasionally out of compassion, and to please my father, who
      said that they ought to have a turn. They were, he told me, in the habit
      of paying him a visit, whenever I had particularly neglected them, to
      learn the grounds for my disregard of their claims, and they urged him to
      intercede with me, and imparted many of their unpublished adventures, so
      that I should be tempted to give them a chance on the following Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Great Will,&rsquo; my father called Shakespeare, and &lsquo;Slender Billy,&rsquo; Pitt. The
      scene where Great Will killed the deer, dragging Falstaff all over the
      park after it by the light of Bardolph&rsquo;s nose, upon which they put an
      extinguisher if they heard any of the keepers, and so left everybody
      groping about and catching the wrong person, was the most wonderful
      mixture of fun and tears. Great Will was extremely youthful, but everybody
      in the park called him, &lsquo;Father William&rsquo;; and when he wanted to know which
      way the deer had gone, King Lear (or else my memory deceives me) punned,
      and Lady Macbeth waved a handkerchief for it to be steeped in the blood of
      the deer; Shylock ordered one pound of the carcase; Hamlet (the fact was
      impressed on me) offered him a three-legged stool; and a number of kings
      and knights and ladies lit their torches from Bardolph; and away they
      flew, distracting the keepers and leaving Will and his troop to the deer.
      That poor thing died from a different weapon at each recital, though
      always with a flow of blood and a successful dash of his antlers into
      Falstaff; and to hear Falstaff bellow! But it was mournful to hear how
      sorry Great Will was over the animal he had slain. He spoke like music. I
      found it pathetic in spite of my knowing that the whole scene was lighted
      up by Bardolph&rsquo;s nose. When I was just bursting out crying&mdash;for the
      deer&rsquo;s tongue was lolling out and quick pantings were at his side; he had
      little ones at home&mdash;Great Will remembered his engagement to sell
      Shylock a pound of the carcase; determined that no Jew should eat of it,
      he bethought him that Falstaff could well spare a pound, and he said the
      Jew would not see the difference: Falstaff only got off by hard running
      and roaring out that he knew his unclean life would make him taste like
      pork and thus let the Jew into the trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father related all this with such a veritable matter-of-fact air, and
      such liveliness&mdash;he sounded the chase and its cries, and showed King
      Lear tottering, and Hamlet standing dark, and the vast substance of
      Falstaff&mdash;that I followed the incidents excitedly, and really saw
      them, which was better than understanding them. I required some help from
      him to see that Hamlet&rsquo;s offer of a three-legged stool at a feverish
      moment of the chase, was laughable. He taught me what to think of it by
      pitching Great Will&rsquo;s voice high, and Hamlet&rsquo;s very low. By degrees I got
      some unconscious knowledge of the characters of Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      There never was so fascinating a father as mine for a boy anything under
      eight or ten years old. He could guess on Saturday whether I should name
      William Pitt on the Sunday; for, on those occasions, &lsquo;Slender Billy,&rsquo; as I
      hope I am not irreverent in calling him, made up for the dulness of his
      high career with a raspberry-jam tart, for which, my father told me
      solemnly, the illustrious Minister had in his day a passion. If I named
      him, my father would say, &lsquo;W. P., otherwise S. B., was born in the year
      so-and-so; now,&rsquo; and he went to the cupboard, &lsquo;in the name of Politics,
      take this and meditate upon him.&rsquo; The shops being all shut on Sunday, he
      certainly bought it, anticipating me unerringly, on the Saturday, and, as
      soon as the tart appeared, we both shouted. I fancy I remember his
      repeating a couplet,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &lsquo;Billy Pitt took a cake and a raspberry jam,
        When he heard they had taken Seringapatam.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      At any rate, the rumour of his having done so, at periods of strong
      excitement, led to the inexplicable display of foresight on my father&rsquo;s
      part.
    </p>
    <p>
      My meditations upon Pitt were, under this influence, favourable to the
      post of a Prime Minister, but it was merely appetite that induced me to
      choose him; I never could imagine a grandeur in his office,
      notwithstanding my father&rsquo;s eloquent talk of ruling a realm, shepherding a
      people, hurling British thunderbolts. The day&rsquo;s discipline was, that its
      selected hero should reign the undisputed monarch of it, so when I was for
      Pitt, I had my tart as he used to have it, and no story, for he had none,
      and I think my idea of the ruler of a realm presented him to me as a sort
      of shadow about a pastrycook&rsquo;s shop. But I surprised people by speaking of
      him. I made remarks to our landlady which caused her to throw up her hands
      and exclaim that I was astonishing. She would always add a mysterious word
      or two in the hearing of my nursemaid or any friend of hers who looked
      into my room to see me. After my father had got me forward with
      instructions on the piano, and exercises in early English history and the
      book of the Peerage, I became the wonder of the house. I was put up on a
      stool to play &lsquo;In my Cottage near a Wood,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Cherry Ripe,&rsquo; and then, to
      show the range of my accomplishments, I was asked, &lsquo;And who married the
      Dowager Duchess of Dewlap?&rsquo; and I answered, &lsquo;John Gregg Wetherall,
      Esquire, and disgraced the family.&rsquo; Then they asked me how I accounted for
      her behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was because the Duke married a dairymaid,&rsquo; I replied, always tossing
      up my chin at that. My father had concocted the questions and prepared me
      for the responses, but the effect was striking, both upon his visitors and
      the landlady&rsquo;s. Gradually my ear grew accustomed to her invariable whisper
      on these occasions. &lsquo;Blood Rile,&rsquo; she said; and her friends all said &lsquo;No!&rsquo; 
      like the run of a finger down a fiddlestring.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gentleman of his acquaintance called on him one evening to take him out
      for a walk. My father happened to be playing with me when this gentleman
      entered our room: and he jumped up from his hands and knees, and abused
      him for intruding on his privacy, but afterwards he introduced him to me
      as Shylock&rsquo;s great-great-great-grandson, and said that Shylock was
      satisfied with a pound, and his descendant wanted two hundred pounds, or
      else all his body: and this, he said, came of the emigration of the family
      from Venice to England. My father only seemed angry, for he went off with
      Shylock&rsquo;s very great grandson arm-in-arm, exclaiming, &lsquo;To the Rialto!&rsquo; 
      When I told Mrs. Waddy about the visitor, she said, &lsquo;Oh, dear! oh, dear!
      then I&rsquo;m afraid your sweet papa won&rsquo;t return very soon, my pretty pet.&rsquo; We
      waited a number of days, until Mrs. Waddy received a letter from him. She
      came full-dressed into my room, requesting me to give her twenty kisses
      for papa, and I looked on while she arranged her blue bonnet at the glass.
      The bonnet would not fix in its place. At last she sank down crying in a
      chair, and was all brown silk, and said that how to appear before a parcel
      of dreadful men, and perhaps a live duke into the bargain, was more than
      she knew, and more than could be expected of a lone widow woman. &lsquo;Not for
      worlds!&rsquo; she answered my petition to accompany her. She would not, she
      said, have me go to my papa there for anything on earth; my papa would
      perish at the sight of me; I was not even to wish to go. And then she
      exclaimed, &lsquo;Oh, the blessed child&rsquo;s poor papa!&rsquo; and that people were cruel
      to him, and would never take into account his lovely temper, and that
      everybody was his enemy, when he ought to be sitting with the highest in
      the land. I had realized the extremity of my forlorn state on a Sunday
      that passed empty of my father, which felt like his having gone for ever.
      My nursemaid came in to assist in settling Mrs. Waddy&rsquo;s bonnet above the
      six crisp curls, and while they were about it I sat quiet, plucking now
      and then at the brown silk, partly to beg to go with it, partly in
      jealousy and love at the thought of its seeing him from whom I was so
      awfully separated. Mrs. Waddy took fresh kisses off my lips, assuring me
      that my father would have them in twenty minutes, and I was to sit and
      count the time. My nursemaid let her out. I pretended to be absorbed in
      counting, till I saw Mrs. Waddy pass by the window. My heart gave a leap
      of pain. I found the street-door open and no one in the passage, and I ran
      out, thinking that Mrs. Waddy would be obliged to take me if she
      discovered me by her side in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was by no means disconcerted at not seeing her immediately. Running on
      from one street to another, I took the turnings with unhesitating
      boldness, as if I had a destination in view. I must have been out near an
      hour before I understood that Mrs. Waddy had eluded me; so I resolved to
      enjoy the shop-windows with the luxurious freedom of one whose
      speculations on those glorious things all up for show are no longer
      distracted by the run of time and a nursemaid. Little more than a glance
      was enough, now that I knew I could stay as long as I liked. If I stopped
      at all, it was rather to exhibit the bravado of liberty than to
      distinguish any particular shop with my preference: all were equally
      beautiful; so were the carriages; so were the people. Ladies frequently
      turned to look at me, perhaps because I had no covering on my head; but
      they did not interest me in the least. I should have been willing to ask
      them or any one where the Peerage lived, only my mind was quite full, and
      I did not care. I felt sure that a great deal of walking would ultimately
      bring me to St. Paul&rsquo;s or Westminster Abbey; to anything else I was
      indifferent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward sunset my frame was struck as with an arrow by the sensations of
      hunger on passing a cook&rsquo;s-shop. I faltered along, hoping to reach a
      second one, without knowing why I had dragged my limbs from the first.
      There was a boy in ragged breeches, no taller than myself, standing tiptoe
      by the window of a very large and brilliant pastry-cook&rsquo;s. He persuaded me
      to go into the shop and ask for a cake. I thought it perfectly natural to
      do so, being hungry; but when I reached the counter and felt the size of
      the shop, I was abashed, and had to repeat the nature of my petition twice
      to the young woman presiding there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give you a cake, little boy?&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t give cakes, we sell
      them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I am hungry,&rsquo; said I, pursuing my request.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another young woman came, laughing and shaking lots of ringlets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see he&rsquo;s not a common boy? he doesn&rsquo;t whine,&rsquo; she remarked, and
      handed me a stale bun, saying, &lsquo;Here, Master Charles, and you needn&rsquo;t say
      thank you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My name is Harry Richmond, and I thank you very much,&rsquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard her say, as I went out, &lsquo;You can see he&rsquo;s a gentleman&rsquo;s son.&rsquo; The
      ragged boy was awaiting me eagerly. &lsquo;Gemini! you&rsquo;re a lucky one,&rsquo; he
      cried; &lsquo;here, come along, curly-poll.&rsquo; I believe that I meant to share the
      bun with him, but of course he could not be aware of my beneficent
      intentions: so he treated me as he thought I was for treating him, and
      making one snatch at the bun, ran off cramming it into his mouth. I stood
      looking at any hand. I learnt in that instant what thieving was, and
      begging, and hunger, for I would have perished rather than have asked for
      another cake, and as I yearned for it in absolute want of food, the boy&rsquo;s
      ungenerous treatment of me came down in a cloud on my reason. I found
      myself being led through the crush of people, by an old gentleman, to whom
      I must have related an extraordinary rigmarole. He shook his head, saying
      that I was unintelligible; but the questions he put to me, &lsquo;Why had I no
      hat on in the open street?&mdash;Where did my mother live?&mdash;What was
      I doing out alone in London?&rsquo; were so many incitements to autobiographical
      composition to an infant mind, and I tumbled out my history afresh each
      time that he spoke. He led me into a square, stooping his head to listen
      all the while; but when I perceived that we had quitted the region of
      shops I made myself quite intelligible by stopping short and crying: &lsquo;I am
      so hungry.&rsquo; He nodded and said, &lsquo;It &lsquo;s no use cross-examining an empty
      stomach. You&rsquo;ll do me the favour to dine with me, my little man. We&rsquo;ll
      talk over your affairs by-and-by.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My alarm at having left the savoury street of shops was not soothed until
      I found myself sitting at table with him, and a nice young lady, and an
      old one who wore a cap, and made loud remarks on my garments and
      everything I did. I was introduced to them as the little boy dropped from
      the sky. The old gentleman would not allow me to be questioned before I
      had eaten. It was a memorable feast. I had soup, fish, meat, and pastry,
      and, for the first time in my life, a glass of wine. How they laughed to
      see me blink and cough after I had swallowed half the glass like water. At
      once my tongue was unloosed. I seemed to rise right above the roofs of
      London, beneath which I had been but a wandering atom a few minutes ago. I
      talked of my wonderful father, and Great Will, and Pitt, and the Peerage.
      I amazed them with my knowledge. When I finished a long recital of Great
      Will&rsquo;s chase of the deer, by saying that I did not care about politics (I
      meant, in my own mind, that Pitt was dull in comparison), they laughed
      enormously, as if I had fired them off. &lsquo;Do you know what you are, sir?&rsquo; 
      said the old gentleman; he had frowning eyebrows and a merry mouth &lsquo;you&rsquo;re
      a comical character.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt interested in him, and asked him what he was. He informed me that
      he was a lawyer, and ready to be pantaloon to my clown, if I would engage
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you in the Peerage?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not yet,&rsquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I know nothing about you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady screamed with laughter. &lsquo;Oh, you funny little boy; you
      killing little creature!&rsquo; she said, and coming round to me, lifted me out
      of my chair, and wanted to know if I knew how to kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes; I&rsquo;ve been taught that,&rsquo; said I, giving the salute without
      waiting for the invitation; &lsquo;but,&rsquo; I added, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care about it much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was indignant, and told me she was going to be offended, so I let her
      understand that I liked being kissed and played with in the morning before
      I was up, and if she would come to my house ever so early, she would find
      me lying next the wall and ready for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And who lies outside?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s my papa,&rsquo; I was beginning to say, but broke the words with a sob,
      for I seemed to be separated from him now by the sea itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      They petted me tenderly. My story was extracted by alternate leading
      questions from the old gentleman and timely caresses from the ladies. I
      could tell them everything except the name of the street where I lived. My
      midnight excursion from the house of my grandfather excited them chiefly;
      also my having a mother alive who perpetually fanned her face and wore a
      ball-dress and a wreath; things that I remembered of my mother. The ladies
      observed that it was clear I was a romantic child. I noticed that the old
      gentleman said &lsquo;Humph,&rsquo; very often, and his eyebrows were like a rook&rsquo;s
      nest in a tree when I spoke of my father walking away with Shylock&rsquo;s
      descendant and not since returning to me. A big book was fetched out of
      his library, in which he read my grandfather&rsquo;s name. I heard him mention
      it aloud. I had been placed on a stool beside a tea-tray near the fire,
      and there I saw the old red house of Riversley, and my mother dressed in
      white, and my aunt Dorothy; and they all complained that I had ceased to
      love them, and must go to bed, to which I had no objection. Somebody
      carried me up and undressed me, and promised me a great game of kissing in
      the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day in the strange house I heard that the old gentleman had sent
      one of his clerks down to my grandfather at Riversley, and communicated
      with the constables in London; and, by-and-by, Mrs. Waddy arrived, having
      likewise visited those authorities, one of whom supported her claims upon
      me. But the old gentleman wished to keep me until his messenger returned
      from Riversley. He made all sorts of pretexts. In the end, he insisted on
      seeing my father, and Mrs. Waddy, after much hesitation, and even weeping,
      furnished the address: upon hearing which, spoken aside to him, he said,
      &lsquo;I thought so.&rsquo; Mrs. Waddy entreated him to be respectful to my father,
      who was, she declared, his superior, and, begging everybody&rsquo;s pardon
      present, the superior of us all, through no sin of his own, that caused
      him to be so unfortunate; and a real Christian and pattern, in spite of
      outsides, though as true a gentleman as ever walked, and by rights should
      be amongst the highest. She repeated &lsquo;amongst the highest&rsquo; reprovingly,
      with the ears of barley in her blue bonnet shaking, and her hands clasped
      tight in her lap. Old Mr. Bannerbridge (that was the old gentleman&rsquo;s name)
      came back very late from his visit to my father, so late that he said it
      would be cruel to let me go out in the street after my bed-time. Mrs.
      Waddy consented to my remaining, on the condition of my being surrendered
      to her at nine o&rsquo;clock, and no later, the following morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was assured by Mr. Bannerbridge that my father&rsquo;s health and appetite
      were excellent; he gave me a number of unsatisfying messages, all the rest
      concerning his interview he whispered to his daughter and his sister, Miss
      Bannerbridge, who said they hoped they would have news from Hampshire very
      early, so that the poor child might be taken away by the friends of his
      infancy. I could understand that my father was disapproved of by them, and
      that I was a kind of shuttlecock flying between two battledores; but why
      they pitied me I could not understand. There was a great battle about me
      when Mrs. Waddy appeared punctual to her appointed hour. The victory was
      hers, and I, her prize, passed a whole day in different conveyances, the
      last of which landed us miles away from London, at the gates of an old
      drooping, mossed and streaked farmhouse, that was like a wall-flower in
      colour.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. DIPWELL FARM
    </h2>
    <p>
      In rain or in sunshine this old farmhouse had a constant resemblance to a
      wall-flower; and it had the same moist earthy smell, except in the
      kitchen, where John and Martha Thresher lived, apart from their furniture.
      All the fresh eggs, and the butter stamped, with three bees, and the pots
      of honey, the fowls, and the hare lifted out of the hamper by his hind
      legs, and the country loaves smelling heavenly, which used to come to Mrs.
      Waddy&rsquo;s address in London, and appear on my father&rsquo;s table, were products
      of Dipwell farm, and presents from her sister, Martha Thresher. On
      receiving this information I felt at home in a moment, and asked right
      off, &lsquo;How long am I to stay here?&mdash;Am I going away tomorrow?&mdash;What&rsquo;s
      going to be done with me?&rsquo; The women found these questions of a youthful
      wanderer touching. Between kissings and promises of hens to feed, and eggs
      that were to come of it, I settled into contentment. A strong impression
      was made on me by Mrs. Waddy&rsquo;s saying, &lsquo;Here, Master Harry, your own papa
      will come for you; and you may be sure he will, for I have his word he
      will, and he&rsquo;s not one to break it, unless his country&rsquo;s against him; and
      for his darling boy he&rsquo;d march against cannons. So here you&rsquo;ll sit and
      wait for him, won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; I sat down immediately, looking up. Mrs. Waddy
      and Mrs. Thresher raised their hands. I had given them some extraordinary
      proof of my love for my father. The impression I received was, that
      sitting was the thing to conjure him to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where his heart&rsquo;s not concerned,&rsquo; Mrs. Waddy remarked of me flatteringly,
      &lsquo;he&rsquo;s shrewd as a little schoolmaster.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ve a bird&rsquo;s-nesting eye,&rsquo; said Mrs. Thresher, whose face I was
      studying.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Thresher wagered I would be a man before either of them reached that
      goal. But whenever he spoke he suffered correction on account of his
      English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More than his eating and his drinking, that child&rsquo;s father worrits about
      his learning to speak the language of a British gentleman,&rsquo; Mrs. Waddy
      exclaimed. &lsquo;Before that child your h&rsquo;s must be like the panting of an
      engine&mdash;to please his father. He &lsquo;d stop me carrying the dinner-tray
      on meat-dish hot, and I&rsquo;m to repeat what I said, to make sure the child
      haven&rsquo;t heard anything ungrammatical. The child&rsquo;s nursemaid he&rsquo;d lecture
      so, the poor girl would come down to me ready to bend double, like a
      bundle of nothing, his observations so took the pride out of her. That&rsquo;s
      because he &lsquo;s a father who knows his duty to the child:&mdash;&ldquo;Child!&rdquo;
       says he, &ldquo;man, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s just as you, John, when you sow your seed you
      think of your harvest. So don&rsquo;t take it ill of me, John; I beg of you be
      careful of your English. Turn it over as you&rsquo;re about to speak.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Change loads on the road, you mean,&rsquo; said John Thresher. &lsquo;Na, na, he&rsquo;s
      come to settle nigh a weedy field, if you like, but his crop ain&rsquo;t nigh
      reaping yet. Hark you, Mary Waddy, who&rsquo;re a widde, which &lsquo;s as much as
      say, an unocc&rsquo;pied mind, there&rsquo;s cockney, and there&rsquo;s country, and there
      &lsquo;s school. Mix the three, strain, and throw away the sediment. Now, yon &lsquo;s
      my view.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife and Mrs. Waddy said reflectively, in a breath, &lsquo;True!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Drink or no, that&rsquo;s the trick o&rsquo; brewery,&rsquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      They assented. They began praising him, too, like meek creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What John says is worth listening to, Mary. You may be over-careful. A
      stew&rsquo;s a stew, and not a boiling to shreds, and you want a steady fire,
      and not a furnace.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I quite agree with John, Martha: we must take the good and the evil
      in a world like this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;m no scholar, and you&rsquo;re at ease,&rsquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waddy put her mouth to his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up went his eyebrows, wrinkling arches over a petrified stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some way she had regained her advantage. &lsquo;Art sure of it?&rsquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray, don&rsquo;t offend me by expressing a doubt of it,&rsquo; she replied, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Thresher poised me in the very centre of his gaze. He declared he
      would never have guessed that, and was reproved, inasmuch as he might have
      guessed it. He then said that I could not associate with any of the
      children thereabout, and my dwelling in the kitchen was not to be thought
      of. The idea of my dwelling in the kitchen seemed to be a serious
      consideration with Mrs. Martha likewise. I was led into the rooms of
      state. The sight of them was enough. I stamped my feet for the kitchen,
      and rarely in my life have been happier than there, dining and supping
      with John and Martha and the farm-labourers, expecting my father across
      the hills, and yet satisfied with the sun. To hope, and not be impatient,
      is really to believe, and this was my feeling in my father&rsquo;s absence. I
      knew he would come, without wishing to hurry him. He had the world beyond
      the hills; I this one, where a slow full river flowed from the sounding
      mill under our garden wall, through long meadows. In Winter the wild ducks
      made letters of the alphabet flying. On the other side of the copses
      bounding our home, there was a park containing trees old as the History of
      England, John Thresher said, and the thought of their venerable age
      enclosed me comfortably. He could not tell me whether he meant as old as
      the book of English History; he fancied he did, for the furrow-track
      follows the plough close upon; but no one exactly could swear when that
      (the book) was put together. At my suggestion, he fixed the trees to the
      date of the Heptarchy, a period of heavy ploughing. Thus begirt by Saxon
      times, I regarded Riversley as a place of extreme baldness, a Greenland,
      untrodden by my Alfred and my Harold. These heroes lived in the circle of
      Dipwell, confidently awaiting the arrival of my father. He sent me once a
      glorious letter. Mrs. Waddy took one of John Thresher&rsquo;s pigeons to London,
      and in the evening we beheld the bird cut the sky like an arrow, bringing
      round his neck a letter warm from him I loved. Planet communicating with
      planet would be not more wonderful to men than words of his to me,
      travelling in such a manner. I went to sleep, and awoke imagining the bird
      bursting out of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile there was an attempt to set me moving again. A strange young man
      was noticed in the neighbourhood of the farm, and he accosted me at
      Leckham fair. &lsquo;I say, don&rsquo;t we know one another? How about your
      grandfather the squire, and your aunt, and Mr. Bannerbridge? I&rsquo;ve got news
      for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Not unwilling to hear him, I took his hand, leaving my companion, the
      miller&rsquo;s little girl, Mabel Sweetwinter, at a toy-stand, while Bob, her
      brother and our guardian, was shying sticks in a fine attitude. &lsquo;Yes, and
      your father, too,&rsquo; said the young man; &lsquo;come along and see him; you can
      run?&rsquo; I showed him how fast. We were pursued by Bob, who fought for me,
      and won me, and my allegiance instantly returned to him. He carried me
      almost the whole of the way back to Dipwell. Women must feel for the lucky
      heroes who win them, something of what I felt for mine; I kissed his
      bloody face, refusing to let him wipe it. John Thresher said to me at
      night, &lsquo;Ay, now you&rsquo;ve got a notion of boxing; and will you believe it,
      Master Harry, there&rsquo;s people fools enough to want to tread that ther&rsquo; 
      first-rate pastime under foot? I speak truth, and my word for &lsquo;t, they&rsquo;d
      better go in petticoats. Let clergymen preach as in duty bound; you and
      I&rsquo;ll uphold a manful sport, we will, and a cheer for Bob!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He assured me, and he had my entire faith, that boxing was England&rsquo;s
      natural protection from the foe. The comfort of having one like Bob to
      defend our country from invasion struck me as inexpressible. Lighted by
      John Thresher&rsquo;s burning patriotism, I entered the book of the History of
      England at about the pace of a carthorse, with a huge waggon at my heels
      in the shape of John. There was no moving on until he was filled. His
      process of receiving historical knowledge was to fight over again the
      personages who did injury to our honour as a nation, then shake hands and
      be proud of them. &lsquo;For where we ain&rsquo;t quite successful we&rsquo;re cunning,&rsquo; he
      said; &lsquo;and we not being able to get rid of William the Conqueror, because
      he&rsquo;s got a will of his own and he won&rsquo;t budge, why, we takes and makes him
      one of ourselves; and no disgrace in that, I should hope! He paid us a
      compliment, don&rsquo;t you see, Master Harry? he wanted to be an Englishman.
      &ldquo;Can you this?&rdquo; says we, sparrin&rsquo; up to him. &ldquo;Pretty middlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; says he,
      &ldquo;and does it well.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; says we, &ldquo;then you&rsquo;re one of us, and
      we&rsquo;ll beat the world&rdquo;; and did so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      John Thresher had a laborious mind; it cost him beads on his forehead to
      mount to these heights of meditation. He told me once that he thought
      one&rsquo;s country was like one&rsquo;s wife: you were born in the first, and married
      to the second, and had to learn all about them afterwards, ay, and make
      the best of them. He recommended me to mix, strain, and throw away the
      sediment, for that was the trick o&rsquo; brewery. Every puzzle that beset him
      in life resolved to this cheerful precept, the value of which, he said,
      was shown by clear brown ale, the drink of the land. Even as a child I
      felt that he was peculiarly an Englishman. Tales of injustice done on the
      Niger river would flush him in a heat of wrath till he cried out for fresh
      taxes to chastise the villains. Yet at the sight of the beggars at his
      gates he groaned at the taxes existing, and enjoined me to have pity on
      the poor taxpayer when I lent a hand to patch the laws. I promised him I
      would unreservedly, with a laugh, but with a sincere intention to
      legislate in a direct manner on his behalf. He, too, though he laughed,
      thanked me kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was clad in black for my distant mother. Mrs. Waddy brought down a young
      man from London to measure me, so that my mourning attire might be in the
      perfect cut of fashion. &lsquo;The child&rsquo;s papa would strip him if he saw him in
      a country tailor&rsquo;s funeral suit,&rsquo; she said, and seemed to blow a wind of
      changes on me that made me sure my father had begun to stir up his part of
      the world. He sent me a prayer in his own handwriting to say for my mother
      in heaven. I saw it flying up between black edges whenever I shut my eyes.
      Martha Thresher dosed me for liver. Mrs. Waddy found me pale by the
      fireside, and prescribed iron. Both agreed upon high-feeding, and the
      apothecary agreed with both in everything, which reconciled them, for both
      good women loved me so heartily they were near upon disputing over the
      medicines I was to consume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under such affectionate treatment I betrayed the alarming symptom that my
      imagination was set more on my mother than on my father: I could not help
      thinking that for any one to go to heaven was stranger than to drive to
      Dipwell, and I had this idea when my father was clasping me in his arms;
      but he melted it like snow off the fields. He came with postillions in
      advance of him wearing crape rosettes, as did the horses. We were in the
      cricket-field, where Dipwell was playing its first match of the season,
      and a Dipwell lad, furious to see the elevens commit such a breach of the
      rules and decency as to troop away while the game was hot, and surround my
      father, flung the cricket-ball into the midst and hit two or three of the
      men hard. My father had to shield him from the consequences. He said he
      liked that boy; and he pleaded for him so winningly and funnily that the
      man who was hurt most laughed loudest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing up in the carriage, and holding me by the hand, he addressed them
      by their names: &lsquo;Sweetwinter, I thank you for your attention to my son;
      and you, Thribble; and you, my man; and you, Baker; Rippengale, and you;
      and you, Jupp&rsquo;; as if he knew them personally. It was true he nodded at
      random. Then he delivered a short speech, and named himself a regular
      subscriber to their innocent pleasures. He gave them money, and scattered
      silver coin among the boys and girls, and praised John Thresher, and
      Martha, his wife, for their care of me, and pointing to the chimneys of
      the farm, said that the house there was holy to him from henceforth, and
      he should visit it annually if possible, but always in the month of May,
      and in the shape of his subscription, as certain as the cowslip. The men,
      after their fit of cheering, appeared unwilling to recommence their play,
      so he alighted and delivered the first ball, and then walked away with my
      hand in his, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, my son, we will return to them tenfold what they have done for you.
      The eleventh day of May shall be a day of pleasure for Dipwell while I
      last, and you will keep it in memory of me when I am gone. And now to see
      the bed you have slept in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Martha Thresher showed him the bed, showed him flowers I had planted, and
      a Spanish chestnut tree just peeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; said he, beaming at every fresh sight of my doings: &lsquo;madam, I am
      your life-long debtor and friend!&rsquo; He kissed her on the cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Thresher cried out: &lsquo;Why, dame, you trembles like a maid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke very faintly, and was red in the face up to the time of our
      departure. John stood like a soldier. We drove away from a cheering crowd
      of cricketers and farm-labourers, as if discharged from a great gun. &lsquo;A
      royal salvo!&rsquo; said my father, and asked me earnestly whether I had
      forgotten to reward and take a particular farewell of any one of my
      friends. I told him I had forgotten no one, and thought it was true, until
      on our way up the sandy lane, which offered us a last close view of the
      old wall-flower farm front, I saw little Mabel Sweetwinter, often my
      playfellow and bedfellow, a curly-headed girl, who would have danced on
      Sunday for a fairing, and eaten gingerbread nuts during a ghost-story. She
      was sitting by a furze-bush in flower, cherishing in her lap a lamb that
      had been worried. She looked half up at me, and kept looking so, but would
      not nod. Then good-bye, thought I, and remembered her look when I had
      forgotten that of all the others.

      CHAPTER IV. I HAVE A TASTE OF GRANDEUR
    </h2>
    <p>
      Though I had not previously seen a postillion in my life, I gazed on the
      pair bobbing regularly on their horses before me, without a thought upon
      the marvel of their sudden apparition and connection with my fortunes. I
      could not tire of hearing the pleasant music of the many feet at the trot,
      and tried to explain to my father that the men going up and down made it
      like a piano that played of itself. He laughed and kissed me; he
      remembered having once shown me the inside of a piano when the keys were
      knocked. My love for him as we drove into London had a recognized footing:
      I perceived that he was my best friend and only true companion, besides
      his being my hero. The wicked men who had parted us were no longer able to
      do harm, he said. I forgot, in my gladness at their defeat, to ask what
      had become of Shylock&rsquo;s descendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waddy welcomed us when we alighted. Do not imagine that it was at the
      door of her old house. It was in a wide street opening on a splendid
      square, and pillars were before the houses, and inside there was the
      enchantment of a little fountain playing thin as whipcord, among ferns, in
      a rock-basin under a window that glowed with kings of England, copied from
      boys&rsquo; history books. All the servants were drawn up in the hall to do
      homage to me. They seemed less real and living than the wonder of the
      sweet-smelling chairs, the birds, and the elegant dogs. Richest of treats,
      a monkey was introduced to me. &lsquo;It &lsquo;s your papa&rsquo;s whim,&rsquo; Mrs. Waddy said,
      resignedly; &lsquo;he says he must have his jester. Indeed it is no joke to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she smiled happily, though her voice was melancholy. From her I now
      learnt that my name was Richmond Roy, and not Harry Richmond. I said,
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; for I was used to change. Everybody in the house wore a happy
      expression of countenance, except the monkey, who was too busy. As we
      mounted the stairs I saw more kings of England painted on the
      back-windows. Mrs. Waddy said: &lsquo;It is considered to give a monarchical
      effect,&rsquo;&mdash;she coughed modestly after the long word, and pursued: &lsquo;as
      it should.&rsquo; I insisted upon going to the top floor, where I expected to
      find William the Conqueror, and found him; but that strong connecting link
      between John Thresher and me presented himself only to carry my
      recollections of the Dipwell of yesterday as far back into the past as the
      old Norman days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And down go all the kings, downstairs,&rsquo; I said, surveying them
      consecutively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she replied, in a tone that might lead one to think it their
      lamentable fate. &lsquo;And did the people look at you as you drove along
      through the streets, Master Richmond?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I said &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; in turn; and then we left off answering, but questioned one
      another, which is a quicker way of getting at facts; I know it is with
      boys and women. Mrs. Waddy cared much less to hear of Dipwell and its
      inhabitants than of the sensation created everywhere by our equipage. I
      noticed that when her voice was not melancholy her face was. She showed me
      a beautiful little pink bed, having a crown over it, in a room opening to
      my father&rsquo;s. Twenty thousand magnificent dreams seemed to flash their
      golden doors when I knew that the bed was mine. I thought it almost as
      nice as a place by my father&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you like it, Mrs. Waddy?&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and sighed. &lsquo;Like it? Oh! yes, my dear, to be sure I do. I only
      hope it won&rsquo;t vanish.&rsquo; She simpered and looked sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had too many distractions, or I should have asked her whether my amazing
      and delightful new home had ever shown symptoms of vanishing; it appeared
      to me, judging from my experience, that nothing moved violently except
      myself, and my principal concern was lest any one should carry me away at
      a moment&rsquo;s notice. In the evening I was introduced to a company of
      gentlemen, who were drinking wine after dinner with my father. They
      clapped their hands and laughed immoderately on my telling them that I
      thought those kings of England who could not find room on the windows must
      have gone down to the cellars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are going,&rsquo; my father said. He drank off a glassful of wine and
      sighed prodigiously. &lsquo;They are going, gentlemen, going there, like good
      wine, like old Port, which they tell us is going also. Favour me by
      drinking to the health of Richmond Roy the younger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They drank to me heartily, but my father had fallen mournful before I left
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pony-riding, and lessons in boxing and wrestling, and lessons in French
      from a French governess, at whose appearance my father always seemed to be
      beginning to dance a minuet, so exuberantly courteous was he; and lessons
      in Latin from a tutor, whom my father invited to dinner once a fortnight,
      but did not distinguish otherwise than occasionally to take down Latin
      sentences in a notebook from his dictation, occupied my mornings. My
      father told the man who instructed me in the art of self-defence that our
      family had always patronized his profession. I wrestled ten minutes every
      day with this man&rsquo;s son, and was regularly thrown. On fine afternoons I
      was dressed in black velvet for a drive in the park, where my father
      uncovered his head to numbers of people, and was much looked at. &lsquo;It is
      our duty, my son, never to forget names and persons; I beg you to bear
      that in mind, my dearest Richie,&rsquo; he said. We used to go to his opera-box;
      and we visited the House of Lords and the House of Commons; and my father,
      though he complained of the decay of British eloquence, and mourned for
      the days of Chatham, and William Pitt (our old friend of the cake and the
      raspberry jam), and Burke, and Sheridan, encouraged the orators with
      approving murmurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father no longer laid stress on my studies of the Peerage. &lsquo;Now I have
      you in the very atmosphere, that will come of itself,&rsquo; he said. I wished
      to know whether I was likely to be transported suddenly to some other
      place. He assured me that nothing save a convulsion of the earth would do
      it, which comforted me, for I took the firmness of the earth in perfect
      trust. We spoke of our old Sunday walks to St. Paul&rsquo;s and Westminster
      Abbey as of a day that had its charm. Our pew among a fashionable
      congregation pleased him better. The pew-opener curtseyed to none as she
      did to him. For my part, I missed the monuments and the chants, and
      something besides that had gone&mdash;I knew not what. At the first
      indication of gloom in me, my father became alarmed, and, after making me
      stand with my tongue out before himself and Mrs. Waddy, like a dragon in a
      piece of tapestry, would resume his old playfulness, and try to be the
      same that he had been in Mrs. Waddy&rsquo;s lodgings. Then we read the Arabian
      Nights together, or, rather, he read them to me, often acting out the
      incidents as we rode or drove abroad. An omission to perform a duty was
      the fatal forgetfulness to sprinkle pepper on the cream-tarts; if my
      father subjected me to an interrogation concerning my lessons, he was the
      dread African magician to whom must be surrendered my acquisition of the
      ring and the musty old lamp. We were quite in the habit of meeting fair
      Persians. He would frequently ejaculate that he resembled the Three
      Calendars in more respects than one. To divert me during my recovery from
      measles, he one day hired an actor in a theatre, and put a cloth round his
      neck, and seated him in a chair, rubbed his chin with soap, and played the
      part of the Barber over him, and I have never laughed so much in my life.
      Poor Mrs. Waddy got her hands at her sides, and kept on gasping, &lsquo;Oh, sir!
      oh!&rsquo; while the Barber hurried away from the half-shaved young man to
      consult his pretended astrolabe in the next room, where we heard him
      shouting the sun&rsquo;s altitude, and consulting its willingness for the
      impatient young man to be further shaved; and back he came, seeming
      refreshed to have learnt the sun&rsquo;s favourable opinion, and gabbling at an
      immense rate, full of barber&rsquo;s business. The servants were allowed to be
      spectators; but as soon as the young man was shaved, my father dismissed
      them with the tone of a master. No wonder they loved him. Mrs. Waddy asked
      who could help it?
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember a pang I had when she spoke of his exposure to the risk of
      marrying again; it added a curious romantic tenderness to my adoration of
      him, and made me feel that he and I stood against the world. To have his
      hand in mine was my delight. Then it was that I could think earnestly of
      Prince Ahmed and the kind and beautiful Peribanou, whom I would not have
      minded his marrying. My favourite dream was to see him shooting an arrow
      in a match for a prize, and losing the prize because of not finding his
      arrow, and wondering where the arrow had flown to, and wandering after it
      till he passed out of green fields to grassy rocks, and to a stony desert,
      where at last he found his arrow at an enormous distance from the shooting
      line, and there was the desert all about him, and the sweetest fairy ever
      imagined going to show herself to him in the ground under his feet. In his
      absence I really hungered for him, and was jealous.

      During this Arabian life, we sat on a carpet that flew to the Continent,
      where I fell sick, and was cured by smelling at an apple; and my father
      directed our movements through the aid of a telescope, which told us the
      titles of the hotels ready to receive us. As for the cities and
      cathedrals, the hot meadows under mountains, the rivers and the
      castles-they were little more to me than an animated book of geography,
      opening and shutting at random; and travelling from place to place must
      have seemed to me so much like the life I had led, that I was generally as
      quick to cry as to laugh, and was never at peace between any two emotions.
      By-and-by I lay in a gondola with a young lady. My father made friends
      fast on our travels: her parents were among the number, and she fell in
      love with me and enjoyed having the name of Peribanou, which I bestowed on
      her for her delicious talk of the blue and red-striped posts that would
      spout up fountains of pearls if they were plucked from their beds, and the
      palaces that had flown out of the farthest corners of the world, and the
      city that would some night or other vanish suddenly, leaving bare
      sea-ripple to say &lsquo;Where? where?&rsquo; as they rolled over. I would have seen
      her marry my father happily. She was like rest and dreams to me, soft sea
      and pearls. We entered into an arrangement to correspond for life. Her
      name was Clara Goodwin; she requested me to go always to the Horse Guards
      to discover in what part of the world Colonel Goodwin might be serving
      when I wanted to write to her. I, in return, could give no permanent
      address, so I related my history from the beginning. &lsquo;To write to you
      would be the same as writing to a river,&rsquo; she said; and insisted that I
      should drop the odious name of Roy when I grew a man. My father quarrelled
      with Colonel Goodwin. Months after I felt as if I had only just been torn
      from Clara, but she stood in a mist, irrecoverably distant. I had no other
      friend.

      Twelve dozen of splendid Burgundy were the fruit of our tour, to be laid
      down at Dipwell farm for my arrival at my majority, when I should be a
      legal man, embarked in my own ship, as my father said. I did not taste the
      wine. &lsquo;Porter for me that day, please God!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Waddy, who did. My
      father eyed her with pity, and ordered her to send the wine down to
      Dipwell, which was done. He took me between his knees, and said
      impressively, &lsquo;Now, Richie, twelve dozen of the best that man can drink
      await you at the gates of manhood. Few fathers can say that to their sons,
      my boy! If we drink it together, blessings on the day! If I&rsquo;m gone,
      Richie, shut up in the long box,&rsquo; his voice shook, and he added, &lsquo;gone to
      Peribanou underneath, you know, remember that your dada saw that the wine
      was a good vintage, and bought it and had it bottled in his own presence
      while you were asleep in the Emperor&rsquo;s room in the fine old Burgundy city,
      and swore that, whatever came to them both, his son should drink the wine
      of princes on the day of his majority.&rsquo; Here my father&rsquo;s tone was highly
      exalted, and he sat in a great flush.
    </p>
    <p>
      I promised him I would bend my steps toward Dipwell to be there on my
      twenty-first birthday, and he pledged himself to be there in spirit at
      least, bodily if possible. We sealed the subject with some tears. He often
      talked of commissioning a poet to compose verses about that wonderful
      coming day at Dipwell. The thought of the day in store for us sent me
      strutting as though I had been in the presence of my drill-master. Mrs.
      Waddy, however, grew extremely melancholy at the mention of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord only knows where we shall all be by that time!&rsquo; she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is a dewy woman,&rsquo; said my father, disdainfully They appeared always
      to be at variance, notwithstanding her absolute devotion to him. My father
      threatened to have her married to somebody immediately if she afflicted
      him with what he called her Waddyism. She had got the habit of exclaiming
      at the end of her remarks, &lsquo;No matter; our clock strikes soon!&rsquo; in a way
      that communicated to me an obscure idea of a door going to open
      unexpectedly in one of the walls, and conduct us, by subterranean
      passages, into a new country. My father&rsquo;s method of rebuking her anxious
      nature was to summon his cook, the funniest of Frenchmen, Monsieur
      Alphonse, and issue orders for a succession of six dinner-parties. &lsquo;And
      now, ma&rsquo;am, you have occupation for your mind,&rsquo; he would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      To judge by the instantaneous composure of her whole appearance, he did
      produce a temporary abatement of her malady. The good soul bustled out of
      the room in attendance upon M. Alphonse, and never complained while the
      dinners lasted, but it was whispered that she had fits in the upper part
      of the house. No sooner did my father hear the rumour than he accused her
      to her face of this enormity, telling her that he was determined to effect
      a permanent cure, even though she should drive him to unlimited expense.
      We had a Ball party and an Aladdin supper, and for a fortnight my father
      hired postillions; we flashed through London. My father backed a horse to
      run in the races on Epsom Downs named Prince Royal, only for the reason
      that his name was Prince Royal, and the horse won, which was, he said, a
      proof to me that in our country it was common prudence to stick to
      Royalty; and he bade me note that if he went in a carriage and two, he was
      comparatively unnoticed, whereas when he was beheld in a carriage and
      four, with postillions, at a glance from him the country people tugged
      their forelocks, and would like, if he would let them, to kiss his hand.
      &lsquo;We will try the scarlet livery on one of our drives, Richie,&rsquo; said he.
      Mrs. Waddy heard him. &lsquo;It is unlawful, sir,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;For whom, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; 
      asked my father. &lsquo;None but Royal...&rsquo; she was explaining, but stopped, for
      he showed her an awful frown, and she cried so that my heart ached for
      her. My father went out to order the livery on the spot. He was very
      excited. Then it was that Mrs. Waddy, embracing me, said, &lsquo;My dear, my own
      Master Richmond, my little Harry, prepare your poor child&rsquo;s heart for evil
      days.&rsquo; I construed her unintelligible speech as an attack upon my father,
      and abused her violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was in this state of wrathful championship, the hall-door was
      opened. I ran out and caught sight of my aunt Dorothy, in company with old
      Mr. Bannerbridge. I was kissed and hugged for I know not how long, until
      the smell of Riversley took entire possession of me, and my old home
      seemed nearer than the one I lived in; but my aunt, seeing tears on my
      cheeks, asked me what was my cause of sorrow. In a moment I poured out a
      flood of complaints against Mrs. Waddy for vexing my father. When she
      heard of the scarlet livery, my aunt lifted her hands. &lsquo;The man is near
      the end of his wits and his money together,&rsquo; said Mr. Bannerbridge; and
      she said to me, &lsquo;My darling Harry will come back to his own nice little
      room, and see his grandpapa soon, won&rsquo;t you, my pet? All is ready for him
      there as it used to be, except poor mama. &ldquo;Kiss my boy, my Harry&mdash;Harry
      Richmond.&rdquo; Those were her last words on her death-bed, before she went to
      God, Harry, my own! There is Sampson the pony, and Harry&rsquo;s dog Prince, and
      his lamb Daisy, grown a sheep, and the ploughboy, Dick, with the big
      boots.&rsquo; Much more sweet talk of the same current that made my face cloudy
      and bright, and filled me with desire for Riversley, to see my mother&rsquo;s
      grave and my friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Dorothy looked at me. &lsquo;Come now,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;come with me, Harry.&rsquo; 
      Her trembling seized on me like a fire. I said, &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; though my heart
      sank as if I had lost my father with the word. She caught me in her arms
      tight, murmuring, &lsquo;And dry our tears and make our house laugh. Oh! since
      the night that Harry went..... And I am now Harry&rsquo;s mama, he has me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked on her forehead for the wreath of white flowers my mother used to
      wear, and thought of my father&rsquo;s letter with the prayer written on the
      black-bordered page. I said I would go, but my joy in going was gone. We
      were stopped in the doorway by Mrs. Waddy. Nothing would tempt her to
      surrender me. Mr. Bannerbridge tried reasoning with her, and, as he said,
      put the case, which seemed to have perched on his forefinger. He talked of
      my prospects, of my sole chance of being educated morally and virtuously
      as became the grandson of an English gentleman of a good old family, and
      of my father having spent my mother&rsquo;s estate, and of the danger of his
      doing so with mine, and of religious duty and the awfulness of the
      position Mrs. Waddy stood in. He certainly subdued me to very silent
      breathing, but did not affect me as my aunt Dorothy&rsquo;s picturing of
      Riversley had done; and when Mrs. Waddy, reduced to an apparent
      submissiveness, addressed me piteously, &lsquo;Master Richmond, would you leave
      papa?&rsquo; I cried out, &lsquo;No, no, never leave my papa,&rsquo; and twisted away from
      my aunt&rsquo;s keeping. My father&rsquo;s arrival caused me to be withdrawn, but I
      heard his offer of his hospitality and all that was his; and subsequently
      there was loud talking on his part. I was kissed by my aunt before she
      went. She whispered, &lsquo;Come to us when you are free; think of us when you
      pray.&rsquo; She was full of tears. Mr. Bannerbridge patted my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door closed on them and I thought it was a vision that had passed. But
      now my father set my heart panting with questions as to the terrible
      possibility of us two ever being separated. In some way he painted my
      grandfather so black that I declared earnestly I would rather die than go
      to Riversley; I would never utter the name of the place where there was
      evil speaking of the one I loved dearest. &lsquo;Do not, my son,&rsquo; he said
      solemnly, &lsquo;or it parts us two.&rsquo; I repeated after him, &lsquo;I am a Roy and not
      a Beltham.&rsquo; It was enough to hear that insult and shame had been cast on
      him at Riversley for me to hate the name of the place. We cried and then
      laughed together, and I must have delivered myself with amazing eloquence,
      for my father held me at arms&rsquo; length and said, &lsquo;Richie, the notion of
      training you for a General commandership of the British army is a good
      one, but if you have got the winning tongue, the woolsack will do as well
      for a whisper in the ear of the throne. That is our aim, my son. We say,&mdash;you
      will not acknowledge our birth, you shall acknowledge our worth.&rsquo; He
      complained bitterly of my aunt Dorothy bringing a lawyer to our house. The
      sins of Mrs. Waddy were forgiven her, owing to her noble resistance to the
      legal gentleman&rsquo;s seductive speech. So I walked up and down stairs with
      the kings of England looking at me out of the coloured windows quietly for
      a week; and then two ugly men entered the house, causing me to suffer a
      fearful oppression, though my father was exceedingly kind to them and had
      beds provided for them, saying that they were very old retainers of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the next day our scarlet livery appeared. After exacting particular
      attention to his commands, my father quitted Mrs. Waddy, and we mounted
      the carriage, laughing at her deplorable eyes and prim lips, which he
      imitated for my amusement. &lsquo;A load is off my head,&rsquo; he remarked. He asked
      me if splendour did not fatigue me also. I caught the answer from his face
      and replied that it did, and that I should like to go right on to Dipwell
      &lsquo;The Burgundy sleeps safe there,&rsquo; said my father, and thought over it. We
      had an extraordinary day. People stood fast to gaze at us; in the country
      some pulled off their hats and set up a cheer. The landlords of the inns
      where we baited remained bare-headed until we started afresh, and I,
      according to my father&rsquo;s example, bowed and lifted my cap gravely to
      persons saluting us along the roads. Nor did I seek to know the reason for
      this excess of respectfulness; I was beginning to take to it naturally. At
      the end of a dusty high-road, where it descends the hill into a town, we
      drew up close by a high red wall, behind which I heard boys shouting at
      play. We went among them, accompanied by their master. My father tipped
      the head boy for the benefit of the school, and following lunch with the
      master and his daughter, to whom I gave a kiss at her request, a
      half-holiday was granted to the boys in my name. How they cheered! The
      young lady saw my delight, and held me at the window while my father
      talked with hers; and for a long time after I beheld them in imagination
      talking: that is to say, my father issuing his instructions and Mr.
      Rippenger receiving them like a pliant hodman; for the result of it was
      that two days later, without seeing my kings of England, my home again, or
      London, I was Julia Rippenger&rsquo;s intimate friend and the youngest pupil of
      the school. My father told me subsequently that we slept at an hotel those
      two nights intervening. Memory transplants me from the coach and scarlet
      livery straight to my place of imprisonment.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. I MAKE A DEAR FRIEND
    </h2>
    <p>
      Heriot was the name of the head boy of the school. Boddy was the name of
      one of the ushers. They were both in love with Julia Rippenger. It was my
      fortune to outrun them in her favour for a considerable period, during
      which time, though I had ceased to live in state, and was wearing out my
      suits of velvet, and had neither visit nor letter from my father, I was in
      tolerable bliss. Julia&rsquo;s kisses were showered on me for almost anything I
      said or did, but her admiration of heroism and daring was so fervent that
      I was in no greater danger of becoming effeminate than Achilles when he
      wore girl&rsquo;s clothes. She was seventeen, an age bewitching for boys to look
      up to and men to look down on. The puzzle of the school was how to account
      for her close relationship to old Rippenger. Such an apple on such a
      crab-tree seemed monstrous. Heriot said that he hoped Boddy would marry
      old Rippenger&rsquo;s real daughter, and, said he, that&rsquo;s birch-twigs. I related
      his sparkling speech to Julia, who laughed, accusing him, however, of
      impudence. She let me see a portrait of her dead mother, an Irish lady
      raising dark eyelashes, whom she resembled. I talked of the portrait to
      Heriot, and as I had privileges accorded to none of the other boys and
      could go to her at any hour of the day after lessons, he made me beg for
      him to have a sight of it. She considered awhile, but refused. On hearing
      of the unkind refusal, Heriot stuck his hands into his pockets and gave up
      cricketing. We saw him leaning against a wall in full view of her window,
      while the boys crowded round him trying to get him to practise, a
      school-match of an important character coming off with a rival academy;
      and it was only through fear of our school being beaten if she did not
      relent that Julia handed me the portrait, charging me solemnly to bring it
      back. I promised, of course. Heriot went into his favourite corner of the
      playground, and there looked at it and kissed it, and then buttoned his
      jacket over it tight, growling when I asked him to return it. Julia grew
      frightened. She sent me with numbers of petitions to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here, young un,&rsquo; said Heriot; &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a good little fellow, and I
      like you, but just tell her I believe in nothing but handwriting, and if
      she writes to me for it humbly and nicely she shall have it back. Say I
      only want to get a copy taken by a first-rate painter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia shed tears at his cruelty, called him cruel, wicked, false to his
      word. She wrote, but the letter did not please him, and his reply was
      scornful. At prayers morning and evening, it was pitiful to observe her
      glance of entreaty and her downfallen eyelashes. I guessed that in
      Heriot&rsquo;s letters to her he wanted to make her confess something, which she
      would not do. &lsquo;Now I write to him no more; let him know it, my darling,&rsquo; 
      she said, and the consequence of Heriot&rsquo;s ungrateful obstinacy was that we
      all beheld her, at the ceremony of the consecration of the new church,
      place her hand on Mr. Boddy&rsquo;s arm and allow him to lead her about. Heriot
      kept his eyes on them; his mouth was sharp, and his arms stiff by his
      sides. I was the bearer of a long letter to her that evening. She tore it
      to pieces without reading it. Next day Heriot walked slowly past Mr. Boddy
      holding the portrait in his hands. The usher called to him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you there, Heriot?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My hero stared. &lsquo;Only a family portrait,&rsquo; he answered, thrusting it safe
      in his pocket and fixing his gaze on Julia&rsquo;s window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Permit me to look at it,&rsquo; said Mr. Boddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Permit me to decline to let you,&rsquo; said Heriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look at me, sir,&rsquo; cried Boddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I prefer to look elsewhere, sir,&rsquo; replied Heriot, and there was Julia
      visible at her window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I asked you, sir, civilly,&rsquo; quoth Boddy, &lsquo;for permission to look,&mdash;I
      used the word intentionally; I say I asked you for permission...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; Heriot retorted, quite cool; &lsquo;inferentially you did; but
      you did not use the word permission.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you turned upon me impudently,&rsquo; pursued Boddy, whose colour was
      thunder: &lsquo;you quibbled, sir; you prevaricated; you concealed what you were
      carrying...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am carrying,&rsquo; Heriot corrected his tense; &lsquo;and mean to, in spite of every
      Boddy,&rsquo; he murmured audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like a rascal detected in an act of felony,&rsquo; roared Boddy, &lsquo;you concealed
      it, sir...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Conceal it, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I demand, in obedience to my duty, that you instantly exhibit it for
      my inspection, now, here, at once; no parleying; unbutton, or I call Mr.
      Rippenger to compel you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was standing close by my brave Heriot, rather trembling, studious of his
      manfulness though I was. His left foot was firmly in advance, as he said,
      just in the manner to start an usher furious:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I concealed it, I conceal it; I was carrying it, I carry it: you demand
      that I exhibit for your inspection what I mean no Boddy to see? I have to
      assure you respectfully, sir, that family portraits are sacred things with
      the sons of gentlemen. Here, Richie, off!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the portrait in my hand, and Heriot between me and the usher, in
      the attitude of a fellow keeping another out of his home at
      prisoner&rsquo;s-base. He had spied Mr. Rippenger&rsquo;s head at the playground gate.
      I had just time to see Heriot and the usher in collision before I ran
      through the gate and into Julia&rsquo;s arms in her garden, whither the dreadful
      prospect of an approaching catastrophe had attracted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heriot was merely reported guilty of insolence. He took his five hundred
      lines of Virgil with his usual sarcastic dignity: all he said to Mr.
      Rippenger was, &lsquo;Let it be about Dido, sir,&rsquo; which set several of the boys
      upon Dido&rsquo;s history, but Heriot was condemned to the battles with Turnus.
      My share in this event secured Heriot&rsquo;s friendship to me without costing
      me the slightest inconvenience. &lsquo;Papa would never punish you,&rsquo; Julia said;
      and I felt my rank. Nor was it wonderful I should when Mr. Rippenger was
      constantly speaking of my father&rsquo;s magnificence in my presence before
      company. Allowed to draw on him largely for pocket-money, I maintained my
      father&rsquo;s princely reputation in the school. At times, especially when the
      holidays arrived and I was left alone with Julia, I had fits of
      mournfulness, and almost thought the boys happier than I was. Going home
      began to seem an unattainable thing to me. Having a father, too, a regular
      father, instead of a dazzling angel that appeared at intervals, I
      considered a benefaction, in its way, some recompense to the boys, for
      their not possessing one like mine. My anxiety was relieved by my writing
      letters to my father, addressed to the care of Miss Julia Rippenger, and
      posting them in her work-basket. She favoured me with very funny replies,
      signed, &lsquo;Your own ever-loving Papa,&rsquo; about his being engaged killing
      Bengal tigers and capturing white elephants, a noble occupation that gave
      me exciting and consolatory dreams of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had at last a real letter of his, dated from a foreign city; but he
      mentioned nothing of coming to me. I understood that Mr. Rippenger was
      disappointed with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually a kind of cloud stole over me. I no longer liked to ask for
      pocket-money; I was clad in a suit of plain cloth; I was banished from the
      parlour, and only on Sunday was I permitted to go to Julia. I ceased to
      live in myself. Through the whole course of lessons, at play-time, in my
      bed, and round to morning bell, I was hunting my father in an unknown
      country, generally with the sun setting before me: I ran out of a wood
      almost into a brook to see it sink as if I had again lost sight of him,
      and then a sense of darkness brought me back to my natural consciousness,
      without afflicting me much, but astonishing me. Why was I away from him? I
      could repeat my lessons in the midst of these dreams quite fairly; it was
      the awakening among the circle of the boys that made me falter during a
      recital and ask myself why I was there and he absent? They had given over
      speculating on another holiday and treat from my father; yet he had
      produced such an impression in the school that even when I had descended
      to the level of a total equality with them, they continued to have some
      consideration for me. I was able to talk of foreign cities and could tell
      stories, and I was, besides, under the immediate protection of Heriot. But
      now the shadow of a great calamity fell on me, for my dear Heriot
      announced his intention of leaving the school next half.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t stand being prayed at, morning and evening, by a fellow who
      hasn&rsquo;t the pluck to strike me like a man,&rsquo; he said. Mr. Rippenger had the
      habit of signalizing offenders, in his public prayers, as boys whose
      hearts he wished to be turned from callousness. He perpetually suspected
      plots; and to hear him allude to some deep, long-hatched school conspiracy
      while we knelt motionless on the forms, and fetch a big breath to bring
      out, &lsquo;May the heart of Walter Heriot be turned and he comprehend the
      multitudinous blessings,&rsquo; etc., was intensely distressing. Together with
      Walter Heriot, Andrew Saddlebank, our best bowler, the drollest fellow in
      the world, John Salter, and little Gus Temple, were oftenest cited. They
      declared that they invariably uttered &lsquo;Amen,&rsquo; as Heriot did, but we none
      of us heard this defiant murmur of assent from their lips. Heriot
      pronounced it clearly and cheerfully, causing Julia&rsquo;s figure to shrink as
      she knelt with her face in the chair hard by her father&rsquo;s desk-pulpit. I
      received the hearty congratulations of my comrades for singing out &lsquo;Amen&rsquo; 
      louder than Heriot, like a chorister, though not in so prolonged a note,
      on hearing to my stupefaction Mr. Rippenger implore that the heart of &lsquo;him
      we know as Richmond Roy&rsquo; might be turned. I did it spontaneously. Mr.
      Rippenger gazed at me in descending from his desk; Julia, too, looking
      grieved. For my part, I exulted in having done a thing that gave me a
      likeness to Heriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Little Richmond, you&rsquo;re a little hero,&rsquo; he said, caressing me. &lsquo;I saw old
      Rippenger whisper to that beast, Boddy. Never mind; they won&rsquo;t hurt you as
      long as I&rsquo;m here. Grow tough, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve got to do. I&rsquo;d like to
      see you horsed, only to see whether you&rsquo;re game to take it without wincing&mdash;if
      it didn&rsquo;t hurt you much, little lad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He hugged me up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d take anything for you, Heriot,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; he answered, never meaning me to suffer on his account. He
      had an inimitable manner of sweet speaking that endeared him to younger
      boys capable of appreciating it, with the supernatural power of music. It
      endeared him, I suppose, to young women also. Julia repeated his phrases,
      as for instance, &lsquo;Silly boy, silly boy,&rsquo; spoken with a wave of his hand,
      when a little fellow thanked him for a kindness. She was angry at his
      approval of what she called my defiance of her father, and insisted that I
      was the catspaw of one of Heriot&rsquo;s plots to vex him. &lsquo;Tell Heriot you have
      my command to say you belong to me and must not be misled,&rsquo; she said. His
      answer was that he wanted it in writing. She requested him to deliver up
      her previous letters. Thereupon he charged me with a lengthy epistle,
      which plunged us into boiling water. Mr. Boddy sat in the schoolroom while
      Heriot&rsquo;s pen was at work, on the wet Sunday afternoon. His keen little
      eyes were busy in his flat bird&rsquo;s head all the time Heriot continued
      writing. He saw no more than that Heriot gave me a book; but as I was
      marching away to Julia he called to know where I was going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Miss Rippenger,&rsquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A book, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Show me the book.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It &lsquo;s a book I have lent him, sir,&rsquo; said Heriot, rising. &lsquo;I shall see if
      it&rsquo;s a fit book for a young boy,&rsquo; said Boddy; and before Heriot could
      interpose, he had knocked the book on the floor, and out fell the letter.
      Both sprang down to seize it: their heads encountered, but Heriot had the
      quicker hand; he caught the letter, and cried &lsquo;Off!&rsquo; to me, as on another
      occasion. This time, however, he was not between me and the usher. I was
      seized by the collar, and shakes roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will now understand that you are on a footing with the rest of the
      boys, you Roy,&rsquo; said Boddy. &lsquo;Little scoundrelly spoilt urchins, upsetting
      the discipline of the school, won&rsquo;t do here. Heriot, here is your book. I
      regret,&rsquo; he added, sneering, &lsquo;that a leaf is torn.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I regret, sir, that the poor boy was so savagely handled,&rsquo; said Heriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was warned to avoid insolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, as much Virgil as you like,&rsquo; Heriot retorted; &lsquo;I know him by heart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was past the hour of my customary visit to Julia, and she came to
      discover the reason of my delay. Boddy stood up to explain. Heriot went
      forward, saying, &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;m the one who ought to speak, Miss Rippenger.
      The fact is, I hear from little Roy that you are fond of tales of Indian
      adventure, and I gave him a book for you to read, if you like it. Mr.
      Boddy objected, and treated the youngster rather rigorously. It must have
      been quite a misunderstanding on his part. Here is the book it&rsquo;s extremely
      amusing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia blushed very red. She accepted the book with a soft murmur, and the
      sallow usher had not a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay,&rsquo; said Heriot. &lsquo;I took the liberty to write some notes. My father is
      an Indian officer, you know, and some of the terms in the book are
      difficult without notes. Richie, hand that paper. Here they are, Miss
      Rippenger, if you&rsquo;ll be so kind as to place them in the book.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was hoping with all my might that she would not deny him. She did, and
      my heart sank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I can read it without notes,&rsquo; she said, cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, I listened with indifference to her petition to Boddy that I
      might be allowed to accompany her, and was not at all chagrined by his
      refusal. She laid down the book, saying that I could bring it to her when
      I was out of disgrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening we walked in the playground, where Heriot asked me to do a
      brave thing, which he would never forget. This was that I should take a
      sharp run right past Boddy, who was pacing up and down before the gate
      leading into Julia&rsquo;s garden, and force her to receive the letter. I went
      bounding like a ball. The usher, suspecting only that I hurried to speak
      to him, let me see how indignant he was with my behaviour by striding all
      the faster as I drew near, and so he passed the gate, and I rushed in. I
      had just time to say to Julia, &lsquo;Hide it, or I&rsquo;m in such a scrape.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The next minute she was addressing my enemy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely you would not punish him because he loves me?&rsquo; and he, though he
      spoke of insubordination, merited chastisement; and other usher phrases,
      seemed to melt, and I had what I believe was a primary conception of the
      power of woman. She led him to talk in the gentlest way possible of how
      the rain had refreshed her flowers, and of this and that poor rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could think of nothing but the darling letter, which had flashed out of
      sight as a rabbit pops into burrows. Boddy departed with a rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Richie,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I have to pay to have you with me now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We walked to the summer-house, where she read Heriot&rsquo;s letter through.
      &lsquo;But he is a boy! How old is Heriot? He is not so old as I am!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      These were her words, and she read the letter anew, and read it again
      after she had placed it in her bosom, I meanwhile pouring out praises of
      Heriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You speak of him as if you were in love with him, Richmond,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I do love him,&rsquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not with me?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I do love you too, if you will not make him angry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But do you know what it is he wants of me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I guessed: &lsquo;Yes; he wants you to let him sit close to you for half an
      hour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She said that he sat very near her in church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but he mustn&rsquo;t interrupt the sermon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, and mouthed me over with laughing kisses. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s very
      little he hasn&rsquo;t daring enough for!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We talked of his courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he good as well?&rsquo; said Julia, more to herself than to me; but I sang
      out,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good! Oh, so kind!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This appeared to convince her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very generous to you and every one, is he not?&rsquo; she said; and from that
      moment was all questions concerning his kind treatment of the boys, and as
      to their looking up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I quitted her, taking her message to Heriot: &lsquo;You may tell him&mdash;tell
      him that I can&rsquo;t write.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Heriot frowned on hearing me repeat it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; he went, and was bright in a twinkling: &lsquo;that means she&rsquo;ll come!&rsquo; 
      He smacked his hands together, grew black, and asked, &lsquo;Did she give that
      beast Boddy a rose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to confess she did; and feeling a twinge of my treason to her, felt
      hers to Heriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; he went; &lsquo;she shall suffer for that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was like music going on until the curtain should lift and reveal
      my father to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was soon a secret to be read in Heriot&rsquo;s face for one who loved it
      as I did. Julia&rsquo;s betrayed nothing. I was not taken into their confidence,
      and luckily not; otherwise I fear I should have served them ill, I was so
      poor a dissembler and was so hotly plied with interrogations by the
      suspicious usher. I felt sure that Heriot and Julia met. His eyes were on
      her all through prayer-time, and hers wandered over the boys&rsquo; heads till
      they rested on him, when they gave a short flutter and dropped, like a
      bird shot dead. The boys must have had some knowledge that love was busy
      in their midst, for they spoke of Heriot and Julia as a jolly couple, and
      of Boddy as one meaning to play the part of old Nick the first
      opportunity. She was kinder to them than ever. It was not a new thing that
      she should send in cakes of her own making, but it was extraordinary that
      we should get these thoughtful presents as often as once a fortnight, and
      it became usual to hear a boy exclaim, either among a knot of fellows or
      to himself, &lsquo;By jingo, she is a pretty girl!&rsquo; on her passing out of the
      room, and sometimes entirely of his own idea. I am persuaded that if she
      had consented to marry Boddy, the boys would have been seriously disposed
      to conspire to jump up in the church and forbid the banns. We should have
      preferred to hand her to the junior usher, Catman, of whom the rumour ran
      in the school that he once drank a bottle of wine and was sick after it,
      and he was therefore a weak creature to our minds; the truth of the rumour
      being confirmed by his pale complexion. That we would have handed our
      blooming princess to him was full proof of our abhorrence of Boddy. I
      might have thought with the other boys that she was growing prettier, only
      I never could imagine her so delicious as when she smiled at my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consequence of the enlistment of the whole school in Heriot&rsquo;s
      interests was that at cricket-matches, picnics on the hills, and boating
      on the canal, Mr. Boddy was begirt with spies, and little Temple reported
      to Heriot a conversation that he, lying hidden in tall grass, had heard
      between Boddy and Julia. Boddy asked her to take private lessons in French
      from him. Heriot listened to the monstrous tale as he was on the point of
      entering Julia&rsquo;s boat, where Boddy sat beside her, and Heriot rowed
      stroke-oar. He dipped his blade, and said, loud enough to be heard by me
      in Catman&rsquo;s boat,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think French useful in a military education, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Boddy said, &lsquo;Yes, of course it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Says Heriot, &lsquo;Then I think I shall take lessons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Boddy told him he was taking lessons in the school.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; says Heriot, &lsquo;I mean private lessons&rsquo;; and here he repeated one of
      Temple&rsquo;s pieces of communication: &lsquo;so much more can be imparted in a
      private lesson!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Boddy sprang half up from his seat. &lsquo;Row, sir, and don&rsquo;t talk,&rsquo; he
      growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit, sir, and don&rsquo;t dance in the boat, if you please, or the lady will be
      overset,&rsquo; said Heriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia requested to be allowed to land and walk home. Boddy caught the
      rudder lines and leapt on the bank to hand her out; then all the boys in
      her boat and in Catman&rsquo;s shouted, &lsquo;Miss Julia! dear Miss Julia, don&rsquo;t
      leave us!&rsquo; and we heard wheedling voices: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go off with him alone!&rsquo; 
      Julia bade us behave well or she would not be able to come out with us. At
      her entreaty Boddy stepped back to his post, and the two boats went
      forward like swans that have done ruffling their feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys were exceedingly disappointed that no catastrophe followed the
      events of the day. Heriot, they thought, might have upset the boat, saved
      Julia, and drowned Boddy, and given us a feast of pleasurable excitement:
      instead of which Boddy lived to harass us with his tyrannical impositions
      and spiteful slaps, and it was to him, not to our Heriot, that Julia was
      most gracious. Some of us discussed her conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a coquette,&rsquo; said little Temple. I went off to the French
      dictionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Julia Rippenger a coquette, Heriot?&rsquo; I asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep girls out of your heads, you little fellows,&rsquo; said he, dealing me a
      smart thump.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is a coquette a nasty girl?&rsquo; I persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, a nice one, as it happens,&rsquo; was his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      My only feeling was jealousy of the superior knowledge of the sex
      possessed by Temple, for I could not fathom the meaning of coquette; but
      he had sisters. Temple and I walked the grounds together, mutually
      declaring how much we would forfeit for Heriot&rsquo;s sake. By this time my
      Sunday visits to Julia had been interdicted: I was plunged, as it were, in
      the pit of the school, and my dreams of my father were losing
      distinctness. A series of boxes on the ears from Boddy began to astound
      and transform me. Mr. Rippenger, too, threatened me with carvings, though
      my offences were slight. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Temple and I, in chorus, &lsquo;but you
      daren&rsquo;t strike Heriot!&rsquo; This was our consolation, and the sentiment of the
      school. Fancy, then, our amazement to behold him laying the cane on
      Heriot&rsquo;s shoulders as fiercely as he could, and Boddy seconding him. The
      scene was terrible. We were all at our desks doing evening tasks for the
      morrow, a great matchday at cricket, Boddy watching over us, and
      bellowing, &lsquo;Silence at your work, you lazy fellows, if you want lessons to
      be finished at ten in the morning!&rsquo; A noise came growing up to us from
      below, up the stairs from the wet-weather shed, and Heriot burst into the
      room, old Rippenger after him, panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Boddy, you were right,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;I find him a prowler, breaking all
      rules of discipline. A perverted, impudent rascal! An example shall be set
      to my school, sir. We have been falling lax. What! I find the puppy in my
      garden whistling&mdash;he confesses&mdash;for one of my servants&mdash;here,
      Mr. Boddy, if you please. My school shall see that none insult me with
      impunity!&rsquo; He laid on Heriot like a wind on a bulrush. Heriot bent his
      shoulders a trifle, not his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hit away, sir,&rsquo; he said, during the storm of blows, and I, through my
      tears, imagined him (or I do now) a young eagle forced to bear the
      thunder, but with his face to it. Then we saw Boddy lay hands on him, and
      in a twinkling down pitched the usher, and the boys cheered&mdash;chirped,
      I should say, they exulted so, and merely sang out like birds, without any
      wilfulness of delight or defiance. After the fall of Boddy we had no sense
      of our hero suffering shame. Temple and I clutched fingers tight as long
      as the blows went on. We hoped for Boddy to make another attempt to touch
      Heriot; he held near the master, looking ready to spring, like a sallow
      panther; we kept hoping he would, in our horror of the murderous slashes
      of the cane; and not a syllable did Heriot utter. Temple and I started up,
      unaware of what we were going to do, or of anything until we had got a
      blow a-piece, and were in the thick of it, and Boddy had us both by the
      collars, and was knocking our heads together, as he dragged us back to our
      seats. But the boys told us we stopped the execution. Mr. Rippenger
      addressed us before he left the school-room. Saddlebank, Salter, and a
      good many others, plugged their ears with their fists. That night Boddy
      and Catman paced in the bedchambers, to prevent plotting and conspiracy,
      they said. I longed to get my arms about Heriot, and thought of him, and
      dreamed of blood, and woke in the morning wondering what made me cry, and
      my arms and back very stiff. Heriot was gay as ever, but had fits of
      reserve; the word passed round that we were not to talk of yesterday
      evening. We feared he would refuse to play in the match.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; said he, staring at us angrily. &lsquo;Has Saddlebank broken his arm,
      and can&rsquo;t bowl?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Saddlebank was in excellent trim, though shamefaced, as was Salter,
      and most of the big boys were. They begged Heriot to let them shake his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait till we win our match,&rsquo; said Heriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia did not appear at morning prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Temple, &lsquo;it&rsquo;d make her sick to hear old Massacre praying.&rsquo; It
      had nearly made him sick, he added, and I immediately felt that it had
      nearly made me sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      We supposed we should not see Julia at the match. She came, however, and
      talked to everybody. I could not contain myself, I wanted so to tell her
      what had befallen Heriot overnight, while he was batting, and the whole
      ground cheering his hits. I on one side of her whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say, Julia, my dear, I say, do you know...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Temple on the other: &lsquo;Miss Julia, I wish you&rsquo;d let me tell you&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We longed to arouse her pity for Heriot at the moment she was admiring
      him, but she checked us, and as she was surrounded by ladies and gentlemen
      of the town, and particular friends of hers, we could not speak out.
      Heriot brought his bat to the booth for eighty-nine runs. His sleeve
      happened to be unbuttoned, and there, on his arm, was a mark of the cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look!&rsquo; I said to Julia. But she looked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Richie, are you ill?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She assured me I was very pale, and I felt her trembling excessively, and
      her parasol was covering us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, Roy, Temple,&rsquo; we heard Heriot call; &lsquo;here, come here and bowl to
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I went and bowled till I thought my head was flying after the ball and
      getting knocks, it swam and throbbed so horribly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple related that I fell, and was carried all the way from the
      cricket-field home by Heriot, who would not give me up to the usher. I was
      in Julia&rsquo;s charge three days. Every time I spoke of her father and Heriot,
      she cried, &lsquo;Oh, hush!&rsquo; and had tears on her eyelids. When I was quite
      strong again, I made her hear me out. She held me and rocked over me like
      a green tree in the wind and rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was any name mentioned?&rsquo; she asked, with her mouth working, and to my
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said &lsquo;No, she knew there was none,&rsquo; and seemed to drink and choke,
      and was one minute calm, all but a trembling hanging underlip, next
      smiling on me, and next having her face carved in grimaces by the jerking
      little tugs of her mouth, which I disliked to see, for she would say
      nothing of what she thought of Heriot, and I thought to myself, though I
      forbore to speak unkindly, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use your making yourself look ugly,
      Julia.&rsquo; If she had talked of Heriot, I should have thought that crying
      persons&rsquo; kisses were agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my return into the school, I found it in a convulsion of excitement,
      owing to Heriot&rsquo;s sending Boddy a challenge to fight a duel with pistols.
      Mr. Rippenger preached a sermon to the boys concerning the unChristian
      spirit and hideous moral perversity of one who would even consent to fight
      a duel. How much more reprehensible, then, was one that could bring
      himself to defy a fellow-creature to mortal combat! We were not of his
      opinion; and as these questions are carried by majorities, we decided that
      Boddy was a coward, and approved the idea that Heriot would have to shoot
      or scourge him when the holidays came. Mr. Rippenger concluded his
      observations by remarking that the sharpest punishment he could inflict
      upon Heriot was to leave him to his own conscience; which he did for three
      days, and then asked him if he was in a fit state of mind to beg Mr.
      Boddy&rsquo;s pardon publicly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m quite prepared to tell him what I think of him publicly, sir,&rsquo; said
      Heriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of exultation passed through the school. Mr. Rippenger seized
      little Temple, and flogged him. Far from dreading the rod, now that Heriot
      and Temple had tasted it, I thought of punishment as a mad pleasure, not a
      bit more awful than the burning furze-bush plunged into by our fellows in
      a follow-my-leader scamper on the common; so I caught Temple&rsquo;s hand as he
      went by me, and said, eagerly, &lsquo;Shall I sing out hurrah?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bother it!&rsquo; was Temple&rsquo;s answer, for he had taken a stinging dozen, and
      had a tender skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rippenger called me up to him, to inform me, that whoever I was, and
      whatever I was, and I might be a little impostor foisted on his
      benevolence, yet he would bring me to a knowledge of myself: he gave me
      warning of it; and if my father objected to his method, my father must
      write word to that effect, and attend punctually to business duties, for
      Surrey House was not an almshouse, either for the sons of gentlemen of
      high connection, or for the sons of vagabonds. Mr. Rippenger added a
      spurning shove on my shoulder to his recommendation to me to resume my
      seat. I did not understand him at all. I was, in fact, indebted to a boy
      named Drew, a known sneak, for the explanation, in itself difficult to
      comprehend. It was, that Mr. Rippenger was losing patience because he had
      received no money on account of my boarding and schooling. The
      intelligence filled my head like the buzz of a fly, occupying my
      meditations without leading them anywhere. I spoke on the subject to
      Heriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the sordid old brute!&rsquo; said he of Mr. Rippenger. &lsquo;How can he know the
      habits and feelings of gentlemen? Your father&rsquo;s travelling, and can&rsquo;t
      write, of course. My father&rsquo;s in India, and I get a letter from him about
      once a year. We know one another, and I know he&rsquo;s one of the best officers
      in the British army. It&rsquo;s just the way with schoolmasters and tradesmen:
      they don&rsquo;t care whether a man is doing his duty to his country; he must
      attend to them, settle accounts with them&mdash;hang them! I&rsquo;ll send you
      money, dear little lad, after I&rsquo;ve left.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He dispersed my brooding fit. I was sure my father was a fountain of gold,
      and only happened to be travelling. Besides, Heriot&rsquo;s love for Julia, whom
      none of us saw now, was an incessant distraction. She did not appear at
      prayers. She sat up in the gallery at church, hardly to be spied. A letter
      that Heriot flung over the gardenwall for her was returned to him, open,
      enclosed by post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A letter for Walter Heriot,&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Boddy, lifting it high for
      Heriot to walk and fetch it; and his small eyes blinked when Heriot said
      aloud on his way, cheerfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A letter from the colonel in India!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Boddy waited a minute, and then said, &lsquo;Is your father in good health?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Heriot&rsquo;s face was scarlet. At first he stuttered, &lsquo;My father!&mdash;I hope
      so! What have you in common with him, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You stated that the letter was from your father,&rsquo; said Boddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What if it is, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, in that case, nothing whatever to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked on, and the youngest of us could perceive Boddy was bursting
      with devilish glee. Heriot got a letter posted to Julia. It was laid on
      his desk, with her name scratched completely out, and his put in its
      place. He grew pale and sad, but did his work, playing his games, and only
      letting his friends speak to him of lessons and play. His counsel to me
      was, that in spite of everything, I was always to stick to my tasks and my
      cricket. His sadness he could not conceal. He looked like an old lamp with
      a poor light in it. Not a boy in the school missed seeing how Boddy&rsquo;s flat
      head perpetually had a side-eye on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this came to an end. John Salter&rsquo;s father lived on the other side of
      the downs, and invited three of us to spend a day at his house. The
      selection included Heriot, Saddlebank, and me. Mr. Rippenger, not liking
      to refuse Mr. Salter, consented to our going, but pretended that I was too
      young. Salter said his mother and sisters very much wished to make my
      acquaintance. We went in his father&rsquo;s carriage. A jolly wind blew clouds
      and dust and leaves: I could have fancied I was going to my own father.
      The sensation of freedom had a magical effect on me, so that I was the
      wildest talker of them all. Even in the middle of the family I led the
      conversation; and I did not leave Salter&rsquo;s house without receiving an
      assurance from his elder sisters that they were in love with me. We drove
      home&mdash;back to prison, we called it&mdash;full of good things, talking
      of Salter&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s cellar of wine and of my majority Burgundy, which I
      said, believing it was true, amounted to twelve hundred dozen; and an
      appointment was made for us to meet at Dipwell Farm, to assist in
      consuming it, in my honour and my father&rsquo;s. That matter settled, I felt
      myself rolling over and over at a great rate, and clasping a juniper tree.
      The horses had trenched from the chalk road on to the downs. I had been
      shot out. Heriot and Salter had jumped out&mdash;Heriot to look after me;
      but Saddlebank and the coachman were driving at a great rate over the dark
      slope. Salter felt some anxiety concerning his father&rsquo;s horses, so we left
      him to pursue them, and walked on laughing, Heriot praising me for my
      pluck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say good-bye to you to-night, Richie,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;We&rsquo;re certain to meet
      again. I shall go to a military school. Mind you enter a cavalry regiment
      when you&rsquo;re man enough. Look in the Army List, you&rsquo;ll find me there. My
      aunt shall make a journey and call on you while you&rsquo;re at Rippenger&rsquo;s, so
      you shan&rsquo;t be quite lonely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To my grief, I discovered that Heriot had resolved he would not return to
      school.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll get thrashed,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help it: I hope you&rsquo;ve grown
      tough by this time. I can&rsquo;t stay here. I feel more like a dog than a man
      in that house now. I&rsquo;ll see you back safe. No crying, young cornet!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We had lost the sound of the carriage. Heriot fell to musing. He remarked
      that the accident took away from Mr. Salter the responsibility of
      delivering him at Surrey House, but that he, Heriot, was bound, for Mr.
      Salter&rsquo;s sake, to conduct me to the doors; an unintelligible refinement of
      reasoning, to my wits. We reached our town between two and three in the
      morning. There was a ladder leaning against one of the houses in repair
      near the school. &lsquo;You are here, are you!&rsquo; said Heriot, speaking to the
      ladder: &lsquo;you &lsquo;ll do me a service&mdash;the last I shall want in the
      neighbourhood.&rsquo; He managed to poise the ladder on his shoulder, and moved
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are we going in through the window?&rsquo; I asked, seeing him fix the ladder
      against the school-house wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said, &lsquo;Hush; keep a look-out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw him mount high. When he tapped at the window I remembered it was
      Julia&rsquo;s; I heard her cry out inside. The window rose slowly. Heriot spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have come to say good-bye to you, Julia, dear girl: don&rsquo;t be afraid of
      me.&rsquo; She answered inaudibly to my ears. He begged her to come to him at
      once, only once, and hear him and take his hand. She was timid; he had her
      fingers first, then her whole arm, and she leaned over him. &lsquo;Julia, my
      sweet, dear girl,&rsquo; he said; and she:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heriot, Walter, don&rsquo;t go&mdash;don&rsquo;t go; you do not care for me if you
      go. Oh, don&rsquo;t go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve come to it,&rsquo; said Heriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked why he was not in bed, and moaned on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go.&rsquo; I was speechless with wonder at the night and the scene. They
      whispered; I saw their faces close together, and Heriot&rsquo;s arms round her
      neck. &lsquo;Oh, Heriot, my darling, my Walter,&rsquo; she said, crying, I knew by the
      sound of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me you love me,&rsquo; said Heriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do, I do, only don&rsquo;t go,&rsquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you love me faithfully?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will; I do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say, &ldquo;I love you, Walter.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I love you, Walter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For ever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For ever. Oh! what a morning for me. Do you smell my honeysuckle? Oh,
      don&rsquo;t go away from me, Walter. Do you love me so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d go through a regiment of sabres to get at you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But smell the night air; how sweet! oh, how sweet! No, not kiss me, if
      you are going to leave me; not kiss me, if you can be so cruel!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you dream of me in your bed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, every night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God bless the bed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Every night I dream of you. Oh! brave Heriot; dear, dear Walter, you did
      not betray me; my father struck you, and you let him for my sake. Every
      night I pray heaven to make you forgive him: I thought you would hate me.
      I cried till I was glad you could not see me. Look at those two little
      stars; no, they hurt me, I can&rsquo;t look at them ever again. But no, you are
      not going; you want to frighten me. Do smell the flowers. Don&rsquo;t make them
      poison to me. Oh, what a morning for me when you&rsquo;re lost! And me, to look
      out on the night alone! No, no more kisses! Oh, yes, I will kiss you,
      dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Heriot said, &lsquo;Your mother was Irish, Julia.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. She would have loved you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I &lsquo;ve Irish blood too. Give me her portrait. It &lsquo;s the image of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To take away? Walter! not to take it away?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You darling! to keep me sure of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Part with my mother&rsquo;s portrait?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, yes, if you love me one bit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you are younger than me, Heriot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then good-night, good-bye, Julia.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Walter, I will fetch it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Heriot now told her I was below, and she looked down on me and called my
      name softly, sending kisses from her fingers while he gave the cause for
      our late return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some one must be sitting up for you&mdash;are we safe?&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heriot laughed, and pressed for the portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is all I have. Why should you not have it? I want to be remembered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She sobbed as she said this and disappeared. Heriot still talked into her
      room. I thought I heard a noise of the garden-door opening. A man came out
      rushing at the ladder. I called in terror: &lsquo;Mr. Boddy, stop, sir.&rsquo; He
      pushed me savagely aside, pitching his whole force against the ladder.
      Heriot pulled down Julia&rsquo;s window; he fell with a heavy thump on the
      ground, and I heard a shriek above. He tried to spring to his feet, but
      dropped, supported himself on one of his hands, and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right; no harm done; how do you do, Mr. Boddy? I thought I&rsquo;d try one
      of the attics, as we were late, not to disturb the house. I &lsquo;m not hurt, I
      tell you,&rsquo; he cried as loud as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usher&rsquo;s words were in a confusion of rage and inquiries. He commanded
      Heriot to stand on his legs, abused him, asked him what he meant by it,
      accused him of depravity, of crime, of disgraceful conduct, and attempted
      to pluck him from the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hands off me,&rsquo; said Heriot; &lsquo;I can help myself. The youngster &lsquo;ll help
      me, and we&rsquo;ll go round to the front door. I hope, sir, you will behave
      like a gentleman; make no row here, Mr. Boddy, if you&rsquo;ve any respect for
      people inside. We were upset by Mr. Salter&rsquo;s carriage; it&rsquo;s damaged my
      leg, I believe. Have the goodness, sir, to go in by your road, and we&rsquo;ll
      go round and knock at the front door in the proper way. We shall have to
      disturb the house after all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Heriot insisted. I was astonished to see Boddy obey him and leave us,
      after my dear Heriot had hopped with his hand on my shoulder to the corner
      of the house fronting the road. While we were standing alone a light cart
      drove by. Heriot hailed it, and hopped up to the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take me to London, there&rsquo;s a good fellow,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a gentleman; you
      needn&rsquo;t look fixed. I&rsquo;ll pay you well and thank you. But quick. Haul me
      up, up; here&rsquo;s my hand. By jingo! this is pain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man said, &lsquo;Scamped it out of school, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Heriot replied: &lsquo;Mum. Rely on me when I tell you I&rsquo;m a gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, if I pick up a gentleman, I can&rsquo;t be doing a bad business,&rsquo; said
      the man, hauling him in tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heriot sung to me in his sweet manner, &lsquo;Good-bye, little Richie. Knock
      when five minutes are over. God bless you, dear little lad! Leg &lsquo;ll get
      well by morning, never fear for me; and we&rsquo;ll meet somehow; we&rsquo;ll drink
      the Burgundy. No crying. Kiss your hand to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I kissed my hand to him. I had no tears to shed; my chest kept heaving
      enormously. My friend was gone. I stood in the road straining to hear the
      last of the wheels after they had long been silent.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. A TALE OF A GOOSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      From that hour till the day Heriot&rsquo;s aunt came to see me, I lived
      systematically out of myself in extreme flights of imagination, locking my
      doors up, as it were, all the faster for the extremest strokes of Mr.
      Rippenger&rsquo;s rod. He remarked justly that I grew an impenetrably sullen
      boy, a constitutional rebel, a callous lump: and assured me that if my
      father would not pay for me, I at least should not escape my debts. The
      title of little impostor, transmitted from the master&rsquo;s mouth to the
      school in designation of one who had come to him as a young prince, and
      for whom he had not received one penny&rsquo;s indemnification, naturally caused
      me to have fights with several of the boys. Whereupon I was reported: I
      was prayed at to move my spirit, and flogged to exercise my flesh. The
      prayers I soon learnt to laugh to scorn. The floggings, after they were
      over, crowned me with delicious sensations of martyrdom. Even while the
      sting lasted I could say, it&rsquo;s for Heriot and Julia! and it gave me a
      wonderful penetration into&mdash;the mournful ecstasy of love. Julia was
      sent away to a relative by the sea-side, because, one of the housemaids
      told me, she could not bear to hear of my being beaten. Mr. Rippenger
      summoned me to his private room to bid me inform him whether I had other
      relatives besides my father, such as grandfather, grandmother, uncles, or
      aunts, or a mother. I dare say Julia would have led me to break my word to
      my father by speaking of old Riversley, a place I half longed for since my
      father had grown so distant and dim to me; but confession to Mr. Rippenger
      seemed, as he said of Heriot&rsquo;s behaviour to him, a gross breach of trust
      to my father; so I refused steadily to answer, and suffered the
      consequences now on my dear father&rsquo;s behalf. Heriot&rsquo;s aunt brought me a
      cake, and in a letter from him an extraordinary sum of money for a boy of
      my age. He wrote that he knew I should want it to pay my debts for treats
      to the boys and keep them in good humour. He believed also that his people
      meant to have me for the Christmas holidays. The sum he sent me was five
      pounds, carefully enclosed. I felt myself a prince again. The money was
      like a golden gate through which freedom twinkled a finger. Forthwith I
      paid my debts, amounting to two pounds twelve shillings, and instructed a
      couple of day-boarders, commercial fellows, whose heavy and mysterious
      charges for commissions ran up a bill in no time, to prepare to bring us
      materials for a feast on Saturday. Temple abominated the trading
      propensities of these boys. &lsquo;They never get licked and they&rsquo;ve always got
      money, at least I know they always get mine,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;but you and I and
      Heriot despise them.&rsquo; Our position toward them was that of an encumbered
      aristocracy, and really they paid us great respect. The fact was that,
      when they had trusted us, they were compelled to continue obsequious, for
      Heriot had instilled the sentiment in the school, that gentlemen never
      failed to wipe out debts in the long run, so it was their interest to make
      us feel they knew us to be gentlemen, who were at some time or other sure
      to pay, and thus also they operated on our consciences. From which it
      followed that one title of superiority among us, ranking next in the order
      of nobility to the dignity conferred by Mr. Rippenger&rsquo;s rod, was the being
      down in their books. Temple and I walked in the halo of unlimited credit
      like more than mortal twins. I gave an order for four bottles of
      champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Friday evening Catman walked out with us. His studious habits
      endeared him to us immensely, owing to his having his head in his book on
      all occasions, and a walk under his superintendence was first cousin to
      liberty. Some boys roamed ahead, some lagged behind, while Catman turned
      over his pages, sounding the return only when it grew dark. The rumour of
      the champagne had already intoxicated the boys. There was a companion and
      most auspicious rumour that Boddy was going to be absent on Saturday. If
      so, we said, we may drink our champagne under Catman&rsquo;s nose and he be none
      the wiser. Saddlebank undertook to manage our feast for us. Coming home
      over the downs, just upon twilight, Temple and I saw Saddlebank carrying a
      long withy upright. We asked him what it was for. He shouted back: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
      for fortune. You keep the rear guard.&rsquo; Then we saw him following a man and
      a flock of geese, and imitating the action of the man with his green wand.
      As we were ready to laugh at anything Saddlebank did, we laughed at this.
      The man walked like one half asleep, and appeared to wake up now and then
      to find that he was right in the middle of his geese, and then he waited,
      and Saddlebank waited behind him. Presently the geese passed a lane
      leading off the downs. We saw Saddlebank duck his wand in a coaxing way,
      like an angler dropping his fly for fish; he made all sorts of curious
      easy flourishes against the sky and branched up the lane. We struck after
      him, little suspecting that he had a goose in front, but he had; he had
      cut one of the loiterers off from the flock; and to see him handle his
      wand on either side his goose, encouraging it to go forward, and
      remonstrating, and addressing it in bits of Latin, and the creature
      pattering stiff and astonished, sent us in a dance of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you done, old Saddle?&rsquo; said Temple, though it was perfectly
      clear what Saddlebank had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve carved off a slice of Michaelmas,&rsquo; said Saddlebank, and he hewed the
      air to flick delicately at his goose&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean&mdash;a slice?&rsquo; said we.
    </p>
    <p>
      We wanted to be certain the goose was captured booty. Saddlebank would
      talk nothing but his fun. Temple fetched a roaring sigh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! how good this goose &lsquo;d be with our champagne.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea seized and enraptured me. &lsquo;Saddlebank, I &lsquo;ll buy him off you,&rsquo; I
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chink won&rsquo;t flavour him,&rsquo; said Saddlebank, still at his business: &lsquo;here,
      you two, cut back by the down and try all your might to get a dozen apples
      before Catman counts heads at the door, and you hold your tongues.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We shot past the man with the geese&mdash;I pitied him&mdash;clipped a
      corner of the down, and by dint of hard running reached the main street,
      mad for apples, before Catman appeared there. Apples, champagne, and cakes
      were now provided; all that was left to think of was the goose. We
      glorified Saddlebank&rsquo;s cleverness to the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By jingo! what a treat you&rsquo;ll have,&rsquo; Temple said among them, bursting
      with our secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saddlebank pleaded that he had missed his way on presenting himself ten
      minutes after time. To me and Temple he breathed of goose, but he shunned
      us; he had no fun in him till Saturday afternoon, when Catman called out
      to hear if we were for cricket or a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A walk on the downs,&rsquo; said Saddlebank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple and I echoed him, and Saddlebank motioned his hand as though he
      were wheedling his goose along. Saddlebank spoke a word to my
      commissioners. I was to leave the arrangements for the feast to him, he
      said. John Salter was at home unwell, so Saddlebank was chief. No sooner
      did we stand on the downs than he gathered us all in a circle, and taking
      off his cap threw in it some slips of paper. We had to draw lots who
      should keep by Catman out of twenty-seven; fifteen blanks were marked.
      Temple dashed his hand into the cap first &lsquo;Like my luck,&rsquo; he remarked, and
      pocketed both fists as he began strutting away to hide his desperation at
      drawing a blank. I bought a substitute for him at the price of
      half-a-crown,&mdash;Drew, a fellow we were glad to get rid of; he wanted
      five shillings. The feast was worth fifty, but to haggle about prices
      showed the sneak. He begged us to put by a taste for him; he was groaned
      out of hearing. The fifteen looked so wretched when they saw themselves
      divided from us that I gave them a shilling a-piece to console them. They
      took their instructions from Saddlebank as to how they were to surround
      Catman, and make him fancy us to be all in his neighbourhood; and then we
      shook hands, they requesting us feebly to drink their healths, and we
      saying, ay, that we would.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple was in distress of spirits because of his having been ignominiously
      bought off. Saddlebank, however, put on such a pace that no one had
      leisure for melancholy. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get you fellows up to boiling point,&rsquo; said
      he. There was a tremendously hot sun overhead. On a sudden he halted,
      exclaiming: &lsquo;Cooks and gridirons! what about sage and onions?&rsquo; Only Temple
      and I jumped at the meaning of this. We drew lots for a messenger, and it
      was miserable to behold an unfortunate fellow touch Saddlebank&rsquo;s hand
      containing the notched bit of stick, and find himself condemned to go and
      buy sage and onions somewhere, without knowing what it was for how could
      he guess we were going to cook a raw goose! The lot fell to a boy named
      Barnshed, a big slow boy, half way up every class he was in, but utterly
      stupid out of school; which made Saddlebank say: &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll take it he&rsquo;s the
      bird that wants stuffing.&rsquo; Barnshed was directed where to rejoin us. The
      others asked why he was trotted after sage and onions. &lsquo;Because he&rsquo;s an
      awful goose,&rsquo; said Saddlebank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple and I thought the word was out and hurrahed, and back came
      Barnshed. We had a task in persuading him to resume his expedition, as
      well as Saddlebank to forgive us. Saddlebank&rsquo;s anger was excessive. We
      conciliated him by calling him captain, and pretending to swear an oath of
      allegiance. He now led us through a wood on to some fields down to a shady
      dell, where we were to hold the feast in privacy. He did not descend it
      himself. Vexatious as it was to see a tramp&rsquo;s tent there, we nevertheless
      acknowledged the respectful greeting of the women and the man with a few
      questions about tentpegs, pots, and tin mugs. Saddlebank remained aloft,
      keeping a look-out for the day-school fellows, Chaunter, Davis, and
      Bystop, my commissioners. They did not keep us waiting long. They had
      driven to the spot in a cart, according to Saddlebank&rsquo;s directions. Our
      provisions were in three large hampers. We praised their forethought
      loudly at the sight of an extra bottle of champagne, with two bottles of
      ginger-wine, two of currant, two of raisin, four pint bottles of ale, six
      of ginger-beer, a Dutch cheese, a heap of tarts, three sally-lunns, and
      four shillingsworth of toffy. Temple and I joined our apples to the mass:
      a sight at which some of the boys exulted aloud. The tramp-women insisted
      on spreading things out for us: ten yards off their children squatted
      staring: the man smoked and chaffed us.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Saddlebank came running over the hill-side, making as if he meant
      to bowl down what looked a black body of a baby against the sky, and
      shouting, &lsquo;See, you fellows, here&rsquo;s a find!&rsquo; He ran through us, swinging
      his goose up to the hampers, saying that he had found the goose under a
      furze-bush. While the words were coming out of his mouth, he saw the
      tramps, and the male tramp&rsquo;s eyes and his met.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man had one eyebrow and his lips at one corner screwed in a queer
      lift: he winked slowly. &lsquo;Odd! ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saddlebank shouldered round on us, and cried, &lsquo;Confound you fellows!
      here&rsquo;s a beastly place you&rsquo;ve pitched upon.&rsquo; His face was the colour of
      scarlet in patches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, I call it a beautiful place,&rsquo; said the man, &lsquo;and if you finds gooses
      hereabouts growing ready for the fire, all but plucking, why, it&rsquo;s a
      bountiful place, I call it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The women tried to keep him silent. But for them we should have moved our
      encampment. &lsquo;Why, of course, young gentlemen, if you want to eat the
      goose, we&rsquo;ll pluck it for you and cook it for you, all nice,&rsquo; they said.
      &lsquo;How can young gentlemen do that for theirselves?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was clear to us we must have a fire for the goose. Certain observations
      current among us about the necessity to remove the goose&rsquo;s inside, and not
      to lose the giblets, which even the boy who named them confessed his
      inability to recognize, inclined the majority to accept the woman&rsquo;s
      proposal. Saddlebank said it was on our heads, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      To revive his good humour, Temple uncorked a bottle of champagne. The
      tramp-woman lent us a tin mug, and round it went. One boy said, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a
      commencement&rsquo;; another said, &lsquo;Hang old Rippenger.&rsquo; Temple snapped his
      fingers, and Bystop, a farmer&rsquo;s son, said, &lsquo;Well, now I&rsquo;ve drunk
      champagne; I meant to before I died!&rsquo; Most of the boys seemed puzzled by
      it. As for me, my heart sprang up in me like a colt turned out of stables
      to graze. I determined that the humblest of my retainers should feed from
      my table, and drink to my father&rsquo;s and Heriot&rsquo;s honour, and I poured out
      champagne for the women, who just sipped, and the man, who vowed he
      preferred beer. A spoonful of the mashed tarts I sent to each of the
      children. Only one, the eldest, a girl about a year older than me, or
      younger, with black eyebrows and rough black hair, refused to eat or
      drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let her bide, young gentlemen,&rsquo; said a woman; &lsquo;she&rsquo;s a regular obstinate,
      once she sets in for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the man, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen pigs druv, and I&rsquo;ve seen iron bent double.
      She&rsquo;s harder &lsquo;n both, once she takes &lsquo;t into her head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By jingo, she&rsquo;s pig-iron!&rsquo; cried Temple, and sighed, &lsquo;Oh, dear old
      Heriot!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I flung myself beside him to talk of our lost friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great commotion stirred the boys. They shrieked at beholding their goose
      vanish in a pot for stewing. They wanted roast-goose, they exclaimed, not
      boiled; who cared for boiled goose! But the woman asked them how it was
      possible to roast a goose on the top of wood-flames, where there was
      nothing to hang it by, and nothing would come of it except smoked bones!
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys groaned in consternation, and Saddlebank sowed discontent by
      grumbling, &lsquo;Now you see what your jolly new acquaintances have done for
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So we played at catch with the Dutch cheese, and afterwards bowled it for
      long-stopping, when, to the disgust of Saddlebank and others, down ran the
      black-haired girl and caught the ball clean at wicket-distance. As soon as
      she had done it she was ashamed, and slunk away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys called out, &lsquo;Now, then, pig-iron!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      One fellow enraged me by throwing an apple that hit her in the back. We
      exchanged half-a-dozen blows, whereupon he consented to apologize, and
      roared, &lsquo;Hulloa, pig-iron, sorry if I hurt you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple urged me to insist on the rascal&rsquo;s going on his knees for flinging
      at a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said Chaunter, &lsquo;you were the first to call her pig-iron.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple declared he was a blackguard if he said that. I made the girl take
      a piece of toffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; Saddlebank grumbled, &lsquo;this comes of the precious company you would
      keep in spite of my caution.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man told us to go it, for he liked to observe young gentlemen enjoying
      themselves. Temple tossed him a pint bottle of beer, with an injunction to
      him to shut his trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, you talk my mother tongue,&rsquo; said the man; &lsquo;you&rsquo;re what goes by the
      name of a learned gentleman. Thank ye, sir. You&rsquo;ll be a counsellor some
      day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t get off thieves, I can tell you,&rsquo; said Temple. He was the son of
      a barrister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor you won&rsquo;t help cook their gooses for them, may be,&rsquo; said the man.
      &lsquo;Well, kindness is kindness, all over the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The women stormed at him to command him not to anger the young gentlemen,
      for Saddlebank was swearing awfully in an undertone. He answered them that
      he was the mildest lamb afloat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despairing of the goose, we resolved to finish the cold repast awaiting
      us. The Dutch cheese had been bowled into bits. With a portion of the
      mashed tarts on it, and champagne, it tasted excellently; toffy to follow.
      Those boys who chose ginger-wine had it, and drank, despised. The
      ginger-beer and ale, apples and sallylunns, were reserved for supper. My
      mind became like a driving sky, with glimpses of my father and Heriot
      bursting through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I&rsquo;m not a prince, I&rsquo;m a nobleman,&rsquo; I said to Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied, &lsquo;Army or Navy. I don&rsquo;t much care which. We&rsquo;re sure of a
      foreign war some time. Then you&rsquo;ll see fellows rise: lieutenant, captain,
      colonel, General&mdash;quick as barrels popping at a bird. I should like
      to be Governor of Gibraltar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll come and see you, Temple,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Done! old Richie,&rsquo; he said, grasping my hand warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The truth is, Temple,&rsquo; I confided to him, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve an uncle-I mean a
      grandfather-of enormous property; he owns half Hampshire, I believe, and
      hates my father like poison. I won&rsquo;t stand it. You&rsquo;ve seen my father,
      haven&rsquo;t you? Gentlemen never forget their servants, Temple. Let&rsquo;s drink
      lots more champagne. I wish you and I were knights riding across that
      country there, as they used to, and you saying, &ldquo;I wonder whether your
      father&rsquo;s at home in the castle expecting our arrival.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Baron!&rsquo; said Temple. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s like a Baron, too. His health. Your
      health, sir! It&rsquo;s just the wine to drink it in, Richie. He&rsquo;s one of the
      men I look up to. It &lsquo;s odd he never comes to see you, because he&rsquo;s fond
      of you; the right sort of father! Big men can&rsquo;t be always looking after
      little boys. Not that we&rsquo;re so young, though, now. Lots of fellows of our
      age have done things fellows write about. I feel&mdash;&rsquo; Temple sat up
      swelling his chest to deliver an important sentiment; &lsquo;I feel uncommonly
      thirsty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So did I. We attributed it to the air of the place, Temple going so far as
      to say that it came off the chalk, which somehow stuck in the throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Saddleback, don&rsquo;t look glum,&rsquo; said Temple. &lsquo;Lord, Richie, you should hear
      my father plead in Court with his wig on. They used to say at home I was a
      clever boy when I was a baby. Saddleback, you&rsquo;ve looked glum all the
      afternoon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Treat your superiors respectfully,&rsquo; Saddlebank retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tramp was irritating him. That tramp had never left off smoking and
      leaning on his arm since we first saw him. Two boys named Hackman and
      Montague, not bad fellows, grew desirous of a whiff from his pipe. They
      had it, and lay down silent, back to back. Bystop was led away in a
      wretched plight. Two others, Paynter and Ashworth, attacked the apples,
      rendered desperate by thirst. Saddlebank repelled them furiously. He
      harangued those who might care to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You fellows, by George! you shall eat the goose, I tell you. You&rsquo;ve
      spoilt everything, and I tell you, whether you like it or not, you shall
      have apples with it, and sage and onions too. I don&rsquo;t ask for thanks. And
      I propose to post outposts in the wood to keep watch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted us to draw lots again. His fun had entirely departed from him;
      all he thought of was seeing the goose out of the pot. I had a feeling
      next to hatred for one who could talk of goose. Temple must have shared
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We &lsquo;ve no real captain now dear old Heriot &lsquo;s gone,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;The
      school&rsquo;s topsy-turvy: we&rsquo;re like a lot of things rattled in a box. Oh,
      dear! how I do like a good commander. On he goes, you after him, never
      mind what happens.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A pair of inseparable friends, Happitt and Larkins, nicknamed
      Happy-go-Lucky, were rolling arm-in-arm, declaring they were perfectly
      sober, and, for a proof of it, trying to direct their feet upon a lump of
      chalk, and marching, and missing it. Up came Chaunter to them: &lsquo;Fat
      goose?&rsquo; he said-no more. Both the boys rushed straight as far as they
      could go; both sung out, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m done!&rsquo; and they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple and I contemplated these proceedings as matters belonging to the
      ordinary phenomena of feasting. We agreed that gentlemen were always the
      last to drop, and were assured, therefore, of our living out the field;
      but I dreaded the moment of the goose&rsquo;s appearance, and I think he did
      also. Saddlebank&rsquo;s pertinacity in withholding the cool ginger-beer and the
      apples offended us deeply; we should have conspired against him had we
      reposed confidence in our legs and our tongues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twilight was around us. The tramp-children lay in little bundles in one
      tent; another was being built by the women and the girl. Overhead I
      counted numbers of stars, all small; and lights in the valley-lights of
      palaces to my imagination. Stars and tramps seemed to me to go together.
      Houses imprisoned us, I thought a lost father was never to be discovered
      by remaining in them. Plunged among dark green leaves, smelling
      wood-smoke, at night; at morning waking up, and the world alight, and you
      standing high, and marking the hills where you will see the next morning
      and the next, morning after morning, and one morning the dearest person in
      the world surprising you just before you wake: I thought this a heavenly
      pleasure. But, observing the narrowness of the tents, it struck me there
      would be snoring companions. I felt so intensely sensitive, that the very
      idea of a snore gave me tremours and qualms: it was associated with the
      sense of fat. Saddlebank had the lid of the pot in his hand; we smelt the
      goose, and he cried, &lsquo;Now for supper; now for it! Halloa, you fellows!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bother it, Saddlebank, you&rsquo;ll make Catman hear you,&rsquo; said Temple, wiping
      his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      I perspired coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Catman! He&rsquo;s been at it for the last hour and a half,&rsquo; Saddlebank
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      One boy ran up: he was ready, and the only one who was. Presently Chaunter
      rushed by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Barnshed &lsquo;s in custody; I&rsquo;m away home,&rsquo; he said, passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stared at the black opening of the dell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s Catman; we don&rsquo;t mind him,&rsquo; Saddlebank reassured us; but we
      heard ominous voices, and perceived people standing over a prostrate
      figure. Then we heard a voice too well known to us. It said, &lsquo;The
      explanation of a pupil in your charge, Mr. Catman, being sent barefaced
      into the town&mdash;a scholar of mine-for sage and onions...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old Rippenger!&rsquo; breathed Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sat paralyzed. Now we understood the folly of despatching a donkey like
      Barnshed for sage and onions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, what asses we have been!&rsquo; Temple continued. &lsquo;Come along-we run for
      it! Come along, Richie! They &lsquo;re picking up the fellows like windfalls.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him I would not run for it; in fact, I distrusted my legs; and he
      was staggering, answering Saddlebank&rsquo;s reproaches for having come among
      tramps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Temple, I see you, sir!&rsquo; called Mr. Rippenger. Poor Temple had advanced
      into the firelight.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the instinct to defeat the master, I crawled in the line of the
      shadows to the farther side of a tent, where I felt a hand clutch mine.
      &lsquo;Hide me,&rsquo; said I; and the curtain of the tent was raised. After squeezing
      through boxes and straw, I lay flat, covered by a mat smelling of
      abominable cheese, and felt a head outside it on my chest. Several times
      Mr. Rippenger pronounced my name in the way habitual to him in anger:
      &lsquo;Rye!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple&rsquo;s answer was inaudible to me. Saddlebank spoke, and other boys, and
      the man and the woman. Then a light was thrust in the tent, and the man
      said, &lsquo;Me deceive you, sir! See for yourself, to satisfy yourself. Here&rsquo;s
      our little uns laid warm, and a girl there, head on the mat, going down to
      join her tribe at Lipcombe, and one of our women sleeps here, and all
      told. But for you to suspect me of combining&mdash;Thank ye, sir. You&rsquo;ve
      got my word as a man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The light went away. My chest was relieved of the weight on it. I sat up,
      and the creature who had been kind to me laid mat and straw on the ground,
      and drew my head on her shoulder, where I slept fast.

      CHAPTER VII. A FREE LIFE ON THE ROAD
    </h2>
    <p>
      I woke very early, though I had taken kindly to my pillow, as I found by
      my having an arm round my companion&rsquo;s neck, and her fingers intertwisted
      with mine. For awhile I lay looking at her eyes, which had every
      imaginable light and signification in them; they advised me to lie quiet,
      they laughed at my wonder, they said, &lsquo;Dear little fellow!&rsquo; they flashed
      as from under a cloud, darkened, flashed out of it, seemed to dip in water
      and shine, and were sometimes like a view into a forest, sometimes
      intensely sunny, never quite still. I trusted her, and could have slept
      again, but the sight of the tent stupefied me; I fancied the sky had
      fallen, and gasped for air; my head was extremely dizzy too; not one idea
      in it was kept from wheeling. This confusion of my head flew to my legs
      when, imitating her, I rose to go forth. In a fit of horror I thought, &lsquo;I
      &lsquo;ve forgotten how to walk!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Summoning my manful resolution, I made the attempt to step across the
      children swaddled in matting and straw and old gowns or petticoats. The
      necessity for doing it with a rush seized me after the first step. I
      pitched over one little bundle, right on to the figure of a sleeping
      woman. All she did was to turn round, murmuring, &lsquo;Naughty Jackie.&rsquo; My
      companion pulled me along gravely, and once in the air, with a good breath
      of it in my chest, I felt tall and strong, and knew what had occurred. The
      tent where I had slept struck me as more curious than my own
      circumstances. I lifted my face to the sky; it was just sunrise,
      beautiful; bits of long and curling cloud brushed any way close on the
      blue, and rosy and white, deliciously cool; the grass was all grey, our
      dell in shadow, and the tops of the trees burning, a few birds twittering.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sucked a blade of grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish it was all water here,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come and have a drink and a bathe,&rsquo; said my companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went down the dell and over a juniper slope, reminding me of my day at
      John Salter&rsquo;s house and the last of dear Heriot. Rather to my shame, my
      companion beat me at running; she was very swift, and my legs were stiff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you swim?&rsquo; she asked me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can row, and swim, and fence, and ride, and fire a pistol,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, dear,&rsquo; said she, after eyeing me enviously. I could see that I had
      checked a recital of her accomplishments.
    </p>
    <p>
      We arrived at a clear stream in a gentleman&rsquo;s park, where grass rolled
      smooth as sea-water on a fine day, and cows and horses were feeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can catch that horse and mount him,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Straddle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded down for &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No saddle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded level for &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My respect for her returned. But she could not swim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only up to my knees,&rsquo; she confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have a look at me,&rsquo; said I; and I stripped and shot into the water, happy
      as a fish, and thinking how much nicer it was than champagne. My enjoyment
      made her so envious that she plucked off her stockings, and came in as far
      as she dared. I called to her. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re like a cow,&rsquo; and she showed her
      teeth, bidding me not say that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A cow! a cow!&rsquo; I repeated, in my superior pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spun out in a breath, &lsquo;If you say that, I &lsquo;ll run away with every bit
      of your clothes, and you&rsquo;ll come out and run about naked, you will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now I float,&rsquo; was my answer, &lsquo;now I dive&rsquo;; and when I came up she
      welcomed me with a big bright grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smart run in the heat dried me. I dressed, finding half my money on the
      grass. She asked me to give her one of those bits-a shilling. I gave her
      two, upon which she asked me, invitingly, if ever I tossed. I replied that
      I never tossed for money; but she had caught a shilling, and I could not
      resist guessing &lsquo;heads,&rsquo; and won; the same with her second shilling. She
      handed them to me sullenly, sobbing, yet she would not take them back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By-and-by you give me another two,&rsquo; she said, growing lively again. We
      agreed that it would be a good thing if we entered the village and bought
      something. None of the shops were open. We walked through the churchyard.
      I said, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s where dead people are buried.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll dance if you talk about dead people,&rsquo; said she, and began whooping
      at the pitch of her voice. On my wishing to know why she did it, her reply
      was that it was to make the dead people hear. My feelings were strange:
      the shops not open, and no living people to be seen. We climbed trees, and
      sat on a branch talking of birds&rsquo; eggs till hunger drove us to the village
      street, where, near the public-house, we met the man-tramp, who whistled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was rather amusing. He remarked that he put no questions to me, because
      he put no question to anybody, because answers excited him about subjects
      that had no particular interest to him, and did not benefit him to the
      extent of a pipe of &lsquo;tobacco; and all through not being inquisitive,
      yesterday afternoon he had obtained, as if it had been chucked into his
      lap, a fine-flavoured fat goose honourably for his supper, besides bottles
      of ale, bottles of ginger-pop, and a fair-earned half-crown. That was
      through his not being inquisitive, and he was not going to be inquisitive
      now, knowing me for a gentleman: my master had tipped him half-a-crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for him, and perhaps for my liberty, he employed a verb
      marvellously enlightening to a schoolboy. I tipped him another half-crown.
      He thanked me, observing that there were days when you lay on your back
      and the sky rained apples; while there were other days when you wore your
      fingers down to the first joint to catch a flea. Such was Fortune!
    </p>
    <p>
      In a friendly manner he advised me to go to school; if not there, then to
      go home. My idea, which I had only partly conceived, was to have a look at
      Riversley over a hedge, kiss my aunt Dorothy unaware, and fly subsequently
      in search of my father. Breakfast, however, was my immediate thought. He
      and the girl sat down to breakfast at the inn as my guests. We ate
      muttonchops and eggs, and drank coffee. After it, though I had no
      suspicions, I noticed that the man grew thoughtful. He proposed to me,
      supposing I had no objection against slow travelling, to join company for
      a couple of days, if I was for Hampshire, which I stated was the county I
      meant to visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well then, here now, come along, d &lsquo;ye see, look,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I mustn&rsquo;t be
      pounced on, and no missing young gentleman in my society, and me took
      half-a-crown for his absence; that won&rsquo;t do. You get on pretty well with
      the gal, and that &lsquo;s a screaming farce: none of us do. Lord! she looks
      down on such scum as us. She&rsquo;s gipsy blood, true sort; everything&rsquo;s
      sausages that gets into their pockets, no matter what it was when it was
      out. Well then, now, here, you and the gal go t&rsquo; other side o&rsquo; Bed&rsquo;lming,
      and you wait for us on the heath, and we &lsquo;ll be there to comfort ye &lsquo;fore
      dark. Is it a fister?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand; I agreed; and he remarked that he now counted a
      breakfast in the list of his gains from never asking questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was glad enough to quit the village in a hurry, for the driver of the
      geese, or a man dreadfully resembling him, passed me near the
      public-house, and attacked my conscience on the cowardly side, which is, I
      fear, the first to awaken, and always the liveliest half while we are
      undisciplined. I would have paid him money, but the idea of a conversation
      with him indicated the road back to school. My companion related her
      history. She belonged to a Hampshire gipsy tribe, and had been on a visit
      to a relative down in the East counties, who died on the road, leaving her
      to be brought home by these tramps: she called them mumpers, and made
      faces when she spoke of them. Gipsies, she said, were a different sort:
      gipsies camped in gentlemen&rsquo;s parks; gipsies, horses, fiddles, and the
      wide world&mdash;that was what she liked. The wide world she described as
      a heath, where you looked and never saw the end of it I let her talk on.
      For me to talk of my affairs to a girl without bonnet and boots would have
      been absurd. Otherwise, her society pleased me: she was so like a boy, and
      unlike any boy I knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mental occupation on the road was to calculate how many hill-tops I
      should climb before I beheld Riversley. The Sunday bells sounded homely
      from village to village as soon as I was convinced that I heard no bells
      summoning boarders to Rippenger&rsquo;s school. The shops in the villages
      continued shut; however, I told the girl they should pay me for it next
      day, and we had an interesting topic in discussing as to the various
      things we would buy. She was for bright ribands and draper&rsquo;s stuff, I for
      pastry and letter-paper. The smell of people&rsquo;s dinners united our
      appetites. Going through a village I saw a man carrying a great baked pie,
      smelling overpoweringly, so that to ask him his price for it was a natural
      impulse with me. &lsquo;What! sell my Sunday dinner?&rsquo; he said, and appeared
      ready to drop the dish. Nothing stopped his staring until we had finished
      a plateful a-piece and some beer in his cottage among his family. He
      wanted to take me in alone. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a common tramp,&rsquo; he said of the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a lie,&rsquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I would not leave her hungry outside, so in the end he
      reluctantly invited us both, and introduced us to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a young gentleman asks a bit o&rsquo; dinner, and a young
      I-d&rsquo;n-know-what &lsquo;s after the same; I leaves it to you, missus.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife took it off his shoulders in good humour, saying it was lucky she
      made the pie big enough for her family and strays. They would not accept
      more than a shilling for our joint repast. The man said that was the
      account to a farthing, if I was too proud to be a poor man&rsquo;s guest, and
      insisted on treating him like a public. Perhaps I would shake hands at
      parting? I did cordially, and remembered him when people were not so
      civil. They wanted to know whether we had made a runaway match of it. The
      fun of passing a boys&rsquo;-school and hearing the usher threaten to punish one
      fellow for straying from ranks, entertained me immensely. I laughed at
      them just as the stupid people we met laughed at me, which was unpleasant
      for the time; but I knew there was not a single boy who would not have
      changed places with me, only give him the chance, though my companion was
      a gipsy girl, and she certainly did look odd company for a gentleman&rsquo;s son
      in a tea-garden and public-house parlour. At nightfall, however, I was
      glad of her and she of me, and we walked hand in hand. I narrated tales of
      Roman history. It was very well for her so say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll mother you,&rsquo; as we
      lay down to sleep; I discovered that she would never have hooted over
      churchyard graves in the night. She confessed she believed the devil went
      about in the night. Our bed was a cart under a shed, our bed-clothes
      fern-leaves and armfuls of straw. The shafts of the cart were down, so we
      lay between upright and level, and awakening in the early light I found
      our four legs hanging over the seat in front. &lsquo;How you have been kicking!&rsquo; 
      said I. She accused me of the same. Next minute she pointed over the side
      of the cart, and I saw the tramp&rsquo;s horse and his tents beneath a broad
      roadside oak-tree. Her face was comical, just like a boy&rsquo;s who thinks he
      has escaped and is caught. &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s run,&rsquo; she said. Preferring positive
      independence, I followed her, and then she told me that she had overheard
      the tramp last night swearing I was as good as a fistful of half-crowns
      lost to him if he missed me. The image of Rippenger&rsquo;s school overshadowed
      me at this communication. With some melancholy I said: &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll join your
      friends, won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She snapped her fingers: &lsquo;Mumpers!&rsquo; and walked on carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were now on the great heaths. They brought the memory of my father
      vividly; the smell of the air half inclined me to turn my steps toward
      London, I grew so full of longing for him. Nevertheless I resolved to have
      one gaze at Riversley, my aunt Dorothy, and Sewis, the old grey-brown
      butler, and the lamb that had grown a sheep; wonderful contrasts to my
      grand kings of England career. My first clear recollection of Riversley
      was here, like an outline of a hill seen miles away. I might have shed a
      tear or two out of love for my father, had not the thought that I was a
      very queer boy displaced his image. I could not but be a very queer boy,
      such a lot of things happened to me. Suppose I joined the gipsies? My
      companion wished me to. She had brothers, horse-dealers, beautiful
      fiddlers. Suppose I learnt the fiddle? Suppose I learnt their language and
      went about with them and became king of the gipsies? My companion shook
      her head; she could not encourage this ambitious idea because she had
      never heard of a king of the gipsies or a queen either. &lsquo;We fool people,&rsquo; 
      she said, and offended me, for our school believed in a gipsy king, and
      one fellow, Hackman, used to sing a song of a gipsy king; and it was as
      much as to say that my schoolfellows were fools, every one of them. I
      accused her of telling lies. She grinned angrily. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t tell &lsquo;em to
      friends,&rsquo; she said. We had a quarrel. The truth was, I was enraged at the
      sweeping out of my prospects of rising to distinction among the gipsies.
      After breakfast at an inn, where a waiter laughed at us to our faces, and
      we fed scowling, shy, and hungry, we had another quarrel. I informed her
      of my opinion that gipsies could not tell fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They can, and you come to my mother and my aunt, and see if they can&rsquo;t
      tell your fortune,&rsquo; said she, in a fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, and that&rsquo;s how they fool people,&rsquo; said I. I enjoyed seeing the flash
      of her teeth. But my daring of her to look me in the eyes and swear on her
      oath she believed the fortunes true ones, sent her into a fit of
      sullenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go along, you nasty little fellow, your shadow isn&rsquo;t half a yard,&rsquo; she
      said, and I could smile at that; my shadow stretched half across the road.
      We had a quarrelsome day wherever we went; rarely walking close together
      till nightfall, when she edged up to my hand, with, &lsquo;I say, I&rsquo;ll keep you
      warm to-night, I will.&rsquo; She hugged me almost too tight, but it was warm
      and social, and helped to the triumph of a feeling I had that nothing made
      me regret running away from Rippenger&rsquo;s school.
    </p>
    <p>
      An adventure befell us in the night. A farmer&rsquo;s wife, whom we asked for a
      drink of water after dark, lent us an old blanket to cover us in a dry
      ditch on receiving our promise not to rob the orchard. An old beggar came
      limping by us, and wanted to share our covering. My companion sank right
      under the blanket to peer at him through one of its holes. He stood
      enormous above me in the moonlight, like an apparition touching earth and
      sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cold, cold,&rsquo; he whined: &lsquo;there&rsquo;s ne&rsquo;er a worse off but there&rsquo;s a better
      off. Young un!&rsquo; His words dispersed the fancy that he was something
      horrible, or else my father in disguise going to throw off his rags, and
      shine, and say he had found me. &lsquo;Are ye one, or are ye two?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I replied that we were two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll come and lie in the middle,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t; there&rsquo;s no room,&rsquo; I sang out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s room for any reckoning o&rsquo; empty stomachs in a
      ditch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I prefer to be alone: good-night,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why!&rsquo; he exclaimed, &lsquo;where ha&rsquo; you been t&rsquo; learn language? Halloa!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please, leave me alone; it&rsquo;s my intention to go to sleep,&rsquo; I said, vexed
      at having to conciliate him; he had a big stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oho!&rsquo; went the beggar. Then he recommenced:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me you&rsquo;ve stole nothing in your life! You&rsquo;ve stole a gentleman&rsquo;s
      tongue, I knows the ring o&rsquo; that. How comes you out here? Who&rsquo;s your mate
      there down below? Now, see, I&rsquo;m going to lift my stick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At these menacing words the girl jumped out of the blanket, and I called
      to him that I would rouse the farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why... because I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to knock down a apple or two on your head?&rsquo; he
      inquired, in a tone of reproach. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a young woman you&rsquo;ve got there, eh?
      Well, odd grows odder, like the man who turned three shillings into five.
      Now, you gi&rsquo; me a lie under your blanket, I &lsquo;ll knock down a apple apiece.
      If ever you&rsquo;ve tasted gin, you &lsquo;ll say a apple at night&rsquo;s a cordial,
      though it don&rsquo;t intoxicate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl whispered in my ear, &lsquo;He&rsquo;s lame as ducks.&rsquo; Her meaning seized me
      at once; we both sprang out of the ditch and ran, dragging our blanket
      behind us. He pursued, but we eluded him, and dropped on a quiet
      sleeping-place among furzes. Next morning, when we took the blanket to the
      farm-house, we heard that the old wretch had traduced our characters, and
      got a breakfast through charging us with the robbery of the apple-tree. I
      proved our innocence to the farmer&rsquo;s wife by putting down a shilling. The
      sight of it satisfied her. She combed my hair, brought me a bowl of water
      and a towel, and then gave us a bowl of milk and bread, and dismissed us,
      telling me I had a fair face and dare-devil written on it: as for the
      girl, she said of her that she knew gipsies at a glance, and what God
      Almighty made them for there was no guessing. This set me thinking all
      through the day, &lsquo;What can they have been made for?&rsquo; I bought a red scarf
      for the girl, and other things she fixed her eyes on, but I lost a great
      deal of my feeling of fellowship with her. &lsquo;I dare say they were made for
      fun,&rsquo; I thought, when people laughed at us now, and I laughed also.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a day of rollicking laughter, puzzling the girl, who could only grin
      two or three seconds at a time, and then stared like a dog that waits for
      his master to send him off again running, the corners of her mouth
      twitching for me to laugh or speak, exactly as a dog might wag his tail. I
      studied her in the light of a harmless sort of unaccountable creature;
      witness at any rate for the fact that I had escaped from school.
    </p>
    <p>
      We loitered half the morning round a cricketers&rsquo; booth in a field, where
      there was moderately good cricketing. The people thought it of first-rate
      quality. I told them I knew a fellow who could bowl out either eleven in
      an hour and a half. One of the men frightened me by saying, &lsquo;By Gearge!
      I&rsquo;ll in with you into a gig, and off with you after that ther&rsquo; faller.&rsquo; He
      pretended to mean it, and started up. I watched him without flinching. He
      remarked that if I &lsquo;had not cut my lucky from school, and tossed my cap
      for a free life, he was &mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; whatever may be expressed by a
      slap on the thigh. We played a single-wicket side game, he giving me six
      runs, and crestfallen he was to find himself beaten; but, as I let him
      know, one who had bowled to Heriot for hours and stood against
      Saddlebank&rsquo;s bowling, was a tough customer, never mind his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man offered me his friendship. He made me sit and eat beside him at
      the afternoon dinner of the elevens, and sent platefuls of food to the
      girl, where she was allowed to squat; and said he, &lsquo;You and I&rsquo;ll tie a
      knot, and be friends for life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I replied, &lsquo;With pleasure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We nodded over a glass of ale. In answer to his questions, I stated that I
      liked farms, I would come and see his farm, I would stay with him two or
      three days, I would give him my address if I had one, I was on my way to
      have a look at Riversley Grange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hey!&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;Riversley Grange! Well, to be sure now! I&rsquo;m a tenant of
      Squire Beltham&rsquo;s, and a right sort of landlord, too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s my grandfather, but I don&rsquo;t care much about him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord!&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;What! be you the little boy, why, Master Harry Richmond
      that was carried off in the night, and the old squire shut up doors for a
      fortnight, and made out you was gone in a hearse! Why, I know all about
      you, you see. And back you are, hurrah! The squire &lsquo;ll be hearty, that he
      will. We&rsquo;ve noticed a change in him ever since you left. Gout&rsquo;s been at
      his leg, off and on, a deal shrewder. But he rides to hounds, and dines
      his tenants still, that he does; he&rsquo;s one o&rsquo; th&rsquo; old style. Everything you
      eat and drink&rsquo;s off his estate, the day he dines his tenants. No humbug
      &lsquo;bout old Squire Beltham.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him if Sewis was alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, old Sewis,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re acquainted with old Sewis? Why, of
      course you are. Yes, old Sewis &lsquo;s alive, Master Harry. And you bet me at
      single-wicket! That &lsquo;ll be something to relate to &lsquo;em all. By Gearge, if I
      didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d got a nettle in my fist when I saw you pitch into my
      stumps. Dash it! thinks I. But th&rsquo; old squire &lsquo;ll be proud of you, that he
      will. My farm lies three miles away. You look at a crow flying due
      South-east five minutes from Riversley, and he&rsquo;s over Throckham farm, and
      there I &lsquo;ll drive ye to-night, and to-morrow, clean and tidy out o&rsquo; my
      wife&rsquo;s soap and water, straight to Riversley. Done, eh? My name&rsquo;s
      Eckerthy. No matter where you comes from, here you are, eh, Master Harry?
      And I see you last time in a donkey-basket, and here you come in breeches
      and defy me to singlewicket, and you bet me too!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed for jollity. An extraordinary number of emotions had possession
      of me: the most intelligible one being a restless vexation at myself, as
      the principal person concerned, for not experiencing anything like the
      farmer&rsquo;s happiness. I preferred a gipsy life to Riversley. Gipsies were on
      the road, and that road led to my father. I endeavoured to explain to
      Farmer Eckerthy that I was travelling in this direction merely to have a
      short look at Riversley; but it was impossible; he could not understand
      me. The more I tried, the more he pressed me to finish my glass of ale,
      which had nothing to do with it. I drank, nevertheless, and I suppose said
      many funny things in my anxiety that the farmer should know what I meant;
      he laughed enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was fielding against the opposite eleven, the tramp came into the
      booth, and we had a match of cunning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Schoolmaster&rsquo;s out after you, young gentleman,&rsquo; said he, advising me to
      hurry along the road if I sought to baffle pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pretended alarm, and then said, &lsquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll stand by me,&rsquo; and treated
      him to ale.
    </p>
    <p>
      He assured me I left as many tracks behind me as if I went spilling a box
      of lucifer-matches. He was always for my hastening on until I ordered
      fresh ale for him. The girl and he grimaced at one another in contempt. So
      we remained seeing the game out. By the time the game ended, the tramp had
      drunk numbers of glasses of ale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A fine-flavoured fat goose,&rsquo; he counted his gains since the commencement
      of our acquaintance, &lsquo;bottles of ale and ginger-pop, two half-crowns, more
      ale, and more to follow, let&rsquo;s hope. You only stick to your friends, young
      gentleman, won&rsquo;t you, sir? It&rsquo;s a hard case for a poor man like me if you
      don&rsquo;t. We ain&rsquo;t got such chances every morning of our lives. Do you
      perceive, sir? I request you to inform me, do you perceive, sir? I&rsquo;m
      muddled a bit, sir, but a man must look after his interests.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I perceived he was so muddled as to be unable to conceal that his
      interests were involved in my capture; but I was merry too. Farmer
      Eckerthy dealt the tramp a scattering slap on the back when he returned to
      the booth, elated at having beaten the enemy by a single run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Master Harry Richmond go to Riversley to his grandfather in your company,
      you scoundrel!&rsquo; he cried in a rage, after listening to him. &lsquo;I mean to
      drive him over. It &lsquo;s a comfortable ten-mile, and no more. But I say,
      Master Harry, what do you say to a peck o&rsquo; supper?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He communicated to me confidentially that he did not like to seem to slink
      away from the others, who had made up their minds to stop and sup; so we
      would drive home by moonlight, singing songs. And so we did. I sat beside
      the farmer, the girl scrambled into the hinder part of the cart, and the
      tramp stood moaning, &lsquo;Oh dear! oh dear! you goes away to Riversley without
      your best friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I tossed him a shilling. We sang beginnings and ends of songs. The farmer
      looked at the moon, and said, &lsquo;Lord! she stares at us!&rsquo; Then he sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &lsquo;The moon is shining on Latworth lea,
        And where&rsquo;ll she see such a jovial three
        As we, boys, we? And why is she pale?
        It&rsquo;s because she drinks water instead of ale.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where &lsquo;s the remainder? There&rsquo;s the song&mdash;!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Oh! handsome Miss Gammon
          Has married Lord Mammon,
          And jilted her suitors,
          All Cupid&rsquo;s sharpshooters,
          And gone in a carriage
          And six to her marriage,
   Singing hey! for I&rsquo;ve landed my salmon, my salmon!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Where&rsquo;s the remainder? I heard it th&rsquo; only time I ever was in London town,
      never rested till I&rsquo;d learnt it, and now it&rsquo;s clean gone. What&rsquo;s come to
      me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He sang to &lsquo;Mary of Ellingmere&rsquo; and another maid of some place, and a loud
      song of Britons.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was startling to me to wake up to twilight in the open air and silence,
      for I was unaware that I had fallen asleep. The girl had roused me, and we
      crept down from the cart. Horse and farmer were quite motionless in a
      green hollow beside the roadway. Looking across fields and fir
      plantations, I beheld a house in the strange light of the hour, and my
      heart began beating; but I was overcome with shyness, and said to myself,
      &lsquo;No, no, that&rsquo;s not Riversley; I&rsquo;m sure it isn&rsquo;t&rsquo;; though the certainty of
      it was, in my teeth, refuting me. I ran down the fields to the park and
      the bright little river, and gazed. When I could say, &lsquo;Yes, it is
      Riversley!&rsquo; I turned away, hurt even to a sense of smarting pain, without
      knowing the cause. I dare say it is true, as the girl declared
      subsequently, that I behaved like one in a fit. I dropped, and I may have
      rolled my body and cried. An indefinite resentment at Riversley was the
      feeling I grew conscious of after very fast walking. I would not have
      accepted breakfast there.
    </p>
    <p>
      About mid-day, crossing a stubble-field, the girl met a couple of her
      people-men. Near evening we entered one of their tents. The women set up a
      cry, &lsquo;Kiomi! Kiomi!&rsquo; like a rising rookery. Their eyes and teeth made such
      a flashing as when you dabble a hand in a dark waterpool. The strange
      tongue they talked, with a kind of peck of the voice at a word, rapid,
      never high or low, and then a slide of similar tones all round,&mdash;not
      musical, but catching and incessant,&mdash;gave me an idea that I had
      fallen upon a society of birds, exceedingly curious ones. They welcomed me
      kindly, each of them looking me in the face a bright second or so. I had
      two helps from a splendid pot of broth that hung over a fire in the middle
      of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kiomi was my companion&rsquo;s name. She had sisters Adeline and Eveleen, and
      brothers Osric and William, and she had a cousin a prizefighter. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
      what I&rsquo;ll be,&rsquo; said I. Fiddling for money was not a prospect that charmed
      me, though it was pleasant lying in Kiomi&rsquo;s arms to hear Osric play us off
      to sleep; it was like floating down one of a number of visible rivers; I
      could see them converging and breaking away while I floated smoothly, and
      a wonderful fair country nodded drowsy. From that to cock-crow at a
      stride. Sleep was no more than the passage through the arch of a canal.
      Kiomi and I were on the heath before sunrise, jumping gravel-pits, chasing
      sandpipers, mimicking pewits; it seemed to me I had only just heard the
      last of Osric&rsquo;s fiddle when yellow colour filled in along the sky over
      Riversley. The curious dark thrill of the fiddle in the tent by night
      seemed close up behind the sun, and my quiet fancies as I lay dropping to
      sleep, followed me like unobtrusive shadows during daylight, or, to speak
      truthfully, till about dinner-time, when I thought of nothing but the
      great stew-pot. We fed on plenty; nicer food than Rippenger&rsquo;s, minus
      puddings. After dinner I was ready for mischief. My sensations on seeing
      Kiomi beg of a gentleman were remarkable. I reproached her. She showed me
      sixpence shining in the palm of her hand. I gave her a shilling to keep
      her from it. She had now got one and sixpence, she said: meaning, I
      supposed upon reflection, that her begging had produced that sum, and
      therefore it was a good thing. The money remaining in my pocket amounted
      to five shillings and a penny. I offered it to Kiomi&rsquo;s mother, who refused
      to accept it; so did the father, and Osric also. I might think of them,
      they observed, on my return to my own house: they pointed at Riversley.
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I shan&rsquo;t go there, you may be sure.&rsquo; The women grinned, and
      the men yawned. The business of the men appeared to be to set to work
      about everything as if they had a fire inside them, and then to stretch
      out their legs and lie on their backs, exactly as if the fire had gone
      out. Excepting Osric&rsquo;s practice on the fiddle, and the father&rsquo;s bringing
      in and leading away of horses, they did little work in my sight but brown
      themselves in the sun. One morning Osric&rsquo;s brother came to our camp with
      their cousin the prizefighter&mdash;a young man of lighter complexion,
      upon whom I gazed, remembering John Thresher&rsquo;s reverence for the heroical
      profession. Kiomi whispered some story concerning her brother having met
      the tramp. I did not listen; I was full of a tempest, owing to two causes:
      a studious admiration of the smart young prizefighter&rsquo;s person, and
      wrathful disgust at him for calling Kiomi his wife, and telling her he was
      prepared to marry her as soon as she played her harp like King David. The
      intense folly of his asking a girl to play like David made me despise him,
      but he was splendidly handsome and strong, and to see him put on the
      gloves for a spar with big William, Kiomi&rsquo;s brother, and evade and ward
      the huge blows, would have been a treat to others besides old John of
      Dipwell Farm. He had the agile grace of a leopard; his waistcoat reminded
      me of one; he was like a piece of machinery in free action. Pleased by my
      enthusiasm, he gave me a lesson, promising me more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll be champion some day,&rsquo; said Kiomi, at gnaw upon an apple he had
      given her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knocked the apple on the ground, and stamped on it. She slapped my
      cheek. In a minute we stood in a ring. I beheld the girl actually squaring
      at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fight away,&rsquo; I said, to conceal my shame, and imagining I could slip from
      her hits as easily as the prizefighter did from big William&rsquo;s. I was
      mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! you think I can&rsquo;t defend myself,&rsquo; said Kiomi; and rushed in with one,
      two, quick as a cat, and cool as a statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fight, my merry one; she takes punishment,&rsquo; the prizefighter sang out.
      &lsquo;First blood to you, Kiomi; uncork his claret, my duck; straight at the
      nozzle, he sees more lamps than shine in London, I warrant. Make him
      lively, cook him; tell him who taught you; a downer to him, and I&rsquo;ll marry
      you to-morrow!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I conceived a fury against her as though she had injured me by appearing
      the man&rsquo;s property&mdash;and I was getting the worst of it; her little
      fists shot straight and hard as bars of iron; she liked fighting; she was
      at least my match. To avoid the disgrace of seriously striking her, or of
      being beaten at an open exchange of blows, I made a feint, and caught her
      by the waist and threw her, not very neatly, for I fell myself in her
      grip. They had to pluck her from me by force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you&rsquo;ve gone a course of tuition in wrestling, squire?&rsquo; the
      prizefighter said to me rather savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others were cordial, and did not snarl at me for going to the ropes,
      as he called it. Kiomi desired to renew the conflict. I said aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never fight girls, and I tell you I don&rsquo;t like their licking me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you come down to the river and wash your face,&rsquo; said she, and pulled
      me by the fingers, and when she had washed my face clear of blood, kissed
      me. I thought she tasted of the prizefighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the afternoon Osric proposed that he and I and the prizefighter
      should take a walk. I stipulated for Kiomi to be of the party, which was
      allowed, and the gipsy-women shook my hand as though I had been departing
      on a long expedition, entreating me not to forget them, and never to think
      evil of poor gipsy-folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I mean to stay with you,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      They grinned delightedly, and said I must be back to see them break up
      camp in the evening. Every two or three minutes Kiomi nudged my elbow and
      pointed behind, where I saw the women waving their coloured neckerchiefs.
      Out of sight of our tents we came in view of the tramp. Kiomi said,
      &lsquo;Hide!&rsquo; I dived into a furze dell. The tramp approached, calling out for
      news of me. Now at Rippenger&rsquo;s school, thanks to Heriot, lying was not the
      fashion; still I had heard boys lie, and they can let it out of their
      mouths like a fish, so lively, simple, and solid, that you could fancy a
      master had asked them for it and they answered, &lsquo;There it is.&rsquo; But boys
      cannot lie in one key spontaneously, a number of them to the same effect,
      as my friends here did. I was off, they said; all swung round to signify
      the direction of my steps; my plans were hinted at; particulars were not
      stated on the plea that there should be no tellings; it was remarked that
      I ought to have fair play and &lsquo;law.&rsquo; Kiomi said she hoped he would not
      catch me. The tramp winced with vexation, and the gipsies chaffed him. I
      thanked them in my heart for their loyal conduct. Creeping under cover of
      the dell I passed round to the road over a knoll of firs as quick as my
      feet could carry me, and had just cried, &lsquo;Now I&rsquo;m safe&rsquo;; when a lady
      stepping from a carriage on the road, caught me in her arms and hugged me
      blind. It was my aunt Dorothy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. JANET ILCHESTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was a prisoner, captured by fraud, and with five shillings and a penny
      still remaining to me for an assurance of my power to enjoy freedom. Osric
      and Kiomi did not show themselves on the road, they answered none of my
      shouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is afraid to look me in the face,&rsquo; I said, keeping my anger on Kiomi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harry, Harry,&rsquo; said my aunt, &lsquo;they must have seen me here; do you grieve,
      and you have me, dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eager brown eyes devoured me while I stood panting to be happy, if
      only I might fling my money at Kiomi&rsquo;s feet, and tell her, &lsquo;There, take
      all I have; I hate you!&rsquo; One minute I was curiously perusing the soft
      shade of a moustache on my aunt&rsquo;s upper lip; the next, we jumped into the
      carriage, and she was my dear aunt Dorothy again, and the world began
      rolling another way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gipsies had made an appointment to deliver me over to my aunt; Farmer
      Eckerthy had spoken of me to my grandfather; the tramp had fetched Mr.
      Rippenger on the scene. Rippenger paid the tramp, I dare say; my
      grandfather paid Rippenger&rsquo;s bill and for Saddlebank&rsquo;s goose; my aunt paid
      the gipsies, and I think it doubtful that they handed the tramp a share,
      so he came to the end of his list of benefits from not asking questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned to Riversley more of a man than most boys of my age, and more
      of a child. A small child would not have sulked as I did at Kiomi&rsquo;s
      behaviour; but I met my grandfather&rsquo;s ridiculous politeness with a man&rsquo;s
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you&rsquo;re back, sir, are you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ran like a hare, &lsquo;stead of a fox, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t run like either, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you ride?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir; a horse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That was his greeting and how I took it. I had not run away from him, so I
      had a quiet conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said, shortly after, &lsquo;Look here; your name is Harry Richmond in my
      house&mdash;do you understand? My servants have orders to call you Master
      Harry Richmond, according to your christening. You were born here, sir,
      you will please to recollect. I&rsquo;ll have no vagabond names here&rsquo;&mdash;he
      puffed himself hot, muttering, &lsquo;Nor vagabond airs neither.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew very well what it meant. A sore spirit on my father&rsquo;s behalf kept
      me alive to any insult of him; and feeling that we were immeasurably
      superior to the Beltham blood, I merely said, apart to old Sewis,
      shrugging my shoulders, &lsquo;The squire expects me to recollect where I was
      born. I&rsquo;m not likely to forget his nonsense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sewis, in reply, counselled me to direct a great deal of my attention to
      the stables, and drink claret with the squire in the evening, things so
      little difficult to do that I moralized reflectively, &lsquo;Here &lsquo;s a way of
      gaining a relative&rsquo;s affection!&rsquo; The squire&rsquo;s punctilious regard for
      payments impressed me, it is true. He had saved me from the disgrace of
      owing money to my detested schoolmaster; and, besides, I was under his
      roof, eating of his bread. My late adventurous life taught me that I
      incurred an obligation by it. Kiomi was the sole victim of my anger that
      really seemed to lie down to be trampled on, as she deserved for her
      unpardonable treachery.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees my grandfather got used to me, and commenced saying in approval
      of certain of my performances, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s Beltham in that&mdash;Beltham in
      that!&rsquo; Once out hunting, I took a nasty hedge and ditch in front of him;
      he bawled proudly, &lsquo;Beltham all over!&rsquo; and praised me. At night, drinking
      claret, he said on a sudden, &lsquo;And, egad, Harry, you must jump your head
      across hedges and ditches, my little fellow. It won&rsquo;t do, in these
      confounded days, to have you clever all at the wrong end. In my time, good
      in the saddle was good for everything; but now you must get your brains
      where you can&mdash;pick here, pick there&mdash;and sell &lsquo;em like a
      huckster; some do. Nature&rsquo;s gone&mdash;it&rsquo;s damned artifice rules, I tell
      ye; and a squire of our country must be three parts lawyer to keep his
      own. You must learn; by God, sir, you must cogitate; you must stew at
      books and maps, or you&rsquo;ll have some infernal upstart taking the lead of
      you, and leaving you nothing but the whiff of his tail.&rsquo; He concluded,
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you toss down your claret, my boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus I grew in his favour, till I heard from him that I was to be the heir
      of Riversley and his estates, but on one condition, which he did not then
      mention. If I might have spoken to him of my father, I should have loved
      him. As it was, I liked old Sewis better, for he would talk to me of the
      night when my father carried me away, and though he never uttered the
      flattering words I longed to hear, he repeated the story often, and made
      the red hall glow with beams of my father&rsquo;s image. My walks and rides were
      divided between the road he must have followed toward London, bearing me
      in his arms, and the vacant place of Kiomi&rsquo;s camp. Kiomi stood for
      freedom, pointing into the darkness I wished to penetrate that I might
      find him. If I spoke of him to my aunt she trembled. She said, &lsquo;Yes,
      Harry, tell me all you are thinking about, whatever you want to know&rsquo;; but
      her excessive trembling checked me, and I kept my feelings to myself&mdash;a
      boy with a puzzle in his head and hunger in his heart. At times I rode out
      to the utmost limit of the hour giving me the proper number of minutes to
      race back and dress for dinner at the squire&rsquo;s table, and a great
      wrestling I had with myself to turn my little horse&rsquo;s head from hills and
      valleys lying East; they seemed to have the secret of my father. Blank
      enough they looked if ever I despaired of their knowing more than I. My
      Winter and Summer were the moods of my mind constantly shifting. I would
      have a week of the belief that he was near Riversley, calling for me; a
      week of the fear that he was dead; long dreams of him, as travelling
      through foreign countries, patting the foreheads of boys and girls on his
      way; or driving radiantly, and people bowing. Radiantly, I say: had there
      been touches of colour in these visions, I should have been lured off in
      pursuit of him. The dreams passed colourlessly; I put colouring touches to
      the figures seen in them afterward, when I was cooler, and could say,
      &lsquo;What is the use of fancying things?&rsquo; yet knew that fancying things was a
      consolation. By such means I came to paint the mystery surrounding my
      father in tender colours. I built up a fretted cathedral from what I
      imagined of him, and could pass entirely away out of the world by entering
      the doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Want of boys&rsquo; society as well as hard head-work produced this mischief. My
      lessons were intermittent Resident tutors arrived to instruct me, one
      after another. They were clergymen, and they soon proposed to marry my
      aunt Dorothy, or they rebuked the squire for swearing. The devil was in
      the parsons, he said: in his time they were modest creatures and stuck to
      the bottle and heaven. My aunt was of the opinion of our neighbours, who
      sent their boys to school and thought I should be sent likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said the squire; &lsquo;my life&rsquo;s short when the gout&rsquo;s marching up to
      my middle, and I&rsquo;ll see as much of my heir as I can. Why, the lad&rsquo;s my
      daughter&rsquo;s son: He shall grow up among his tenantry. We&rsquo;ll beat the
      country and start a man at last to drive his yard of learning into him
      without rolling sheep&rsquo;s eyes right and left.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately the squire&rsquo;s description of man was not started. My aunt was
      handsome, an heiress (that is, she had money of her own coming from her
      mother&rsquo;s side of the family), and the tenderest woman alive, with a voice
      sweeter than flutes. There was a saying in the county that to marry a
      Beltham you must po&rsquo;chay her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great-aunt of mine, the squire&rsquo;s sister, had been carried off. She died
      childless. A favourite young cousin of his likewise had run away with a
      poor baronet, Sir Roderick Ilchester, whose son Charles was now and then
      our playmate, and was a scapegrace. But for me he would have been selected
      by the squire for his heir, he said; and he often &lsquo;confounded&rsquo; me to my
      face on that account as he shook my hand, breaking out: &lsquo;I&rsquo;d as lief fetch
      you a cuff o&rsquo; the head, Harry Richmond, upon my honour!&rsquo; and cursing at
      his luck for having to study for his living, and be what he called a
      sloppy curate now that I had come to Riversley for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      He informed me that I should have to marry his sister Janet; for that they
      could not allow the money to go out of the family. Janet Ilchester was a
      quaint girl, a favourite of my aunt Dorothy, and the squire&rsquo;s especial
      pet; red-cheeked, with a good upright figure in walking and riding, and
      willing to be friendly, but we always quarrelled: she detested hearing of
      Kiomi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of creatures you met when you were a beggar, Harry Richmond,&rsquo; 
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never was a beggar,&rsquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then she was a beggar,&rsquo; said Janet; and I could not deny it; though the
      only difference I saw between Janet and Kiomi was, that Janet continually
      begged favours and gifts of people she knew, and Kiomi of people who were
      strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      My allowance of pocket-money from the squire was fifty pounds a year. I
      might have spent it all in satisfying Janet&rsquo;s wishes for riding-whips,
      knives, pencil-cases, cairngorm buttons, and dogs. A large part of the
      money went that way. She was always getting notice of fine dogs for sale.
      I bought a mastiff for her, a brown retriever, and a little terrier. She
      was permitted to keep the terrier at home, but I had to take care of the
      mastiff and retriever. When Janet came to look at them she called them by
      their names; of course they followed me in preference to her; she cried
      with jealousy. We had a downright quarrel. Lady Ilchester invited me to
      spend a day at her house, Charley being home for his Midsummer holidays.
      Charley, Janet, and I fished the river for trout, and Janet, to flatter me
      (of which I was quite aware), while I dressed her rod as if she was likely
      to catch something, talked of Heriot, and then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! dear, we are good friends, aren&rsquo;t we? Charley says we shall marry one
      another some day, but mama&rsquo;s such a proud woman she won&rsquo;t much like your
      having such a father as you &lsquo;ve got unless he &lsquo;s dead by that time and I
      needn&rsquo;t go up to him to be kissed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I stared at the girl in wonderment, but not too angrily, for I guessed
      that she was merely repeating her brother&rsquo;s candid speculations upon the
      future. I said: &lsquo;Now mind what I tell you, Janet: I forgive you this once,
      for you are an ignorant little girl and know no better. Speak respectfully
      of my father or you never see me again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Charley sang out: &lsquo;Hulloa! you don&rsquo;t mean to say you&rsquo;re talking of
      your father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet whimpered that I had called her an ignorant little girl. If she had
      been silent I should have pardoned her. The meanness of the girl in
      turning on me when the glaring offence was hers, struck me as contemptible
      beyond words. Charley and I met half way. He advised me not to talk to his
      sister of my father. They all knew, he said, that it was no fault of mine,
      and for his part, had he a rascal for a father, he should pension him and
      cut him; to tell the truth, no objection against me existed in his family
      except on the score of the sort of father I owned to, and I had better
      make up my mind to shake him off before I grew a man; he spoke as a
      friend. I might frown at him and clench my fists, but he did speak as a
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet all the while was nibbling a biscuit, glancing over it at me with
      mouse-eyes. Her short frock and her greediness, contrasting with the talk
      of my marrying her, filled me with renewed scorn, though my heart was sick
      at the mention of my father. I asked her what she knew of him. She nibbled
      her biscuit, mumbling, &lsquo;He went to Riversley, pretending he was a
      singing-master. I know that&rsquo;s true, and more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, and a drawing-master, and a professor of legerdemain,&rsquo; added her
      brother. &lsquo;Expunge him, old fellow; he&rsquo;s no good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s no good,&rsquo; said Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took her hand, and told her, &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know how you hurt me; but you&rsquo;re
      a child: you don&rsquo;t know anything about the world. I love my father,
      remember that, and what you want me to do is mean and disgraceful; but you
      don&rsquo;t know better. I would forfeit everything in the world for him. And
      when you&rsquo;re of age to marry, marry anybody you like&mdash;you won&rsquo;t marry
      me. And good-bye, Janet. Think of learning your lessons, and not of
      marrying. I can&rsquo;t help laughing.&rsquo; So I said, but without the laughter. Her
      brother tried hard to get me to notice him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet betook herself to the squire. Her prattle of our marriage in days to
      come was excuseable. It was the squire&rsquo;s notion. He used to remark
      generally that he liked to see things look safe and fast, and he had, as
      my aunt confided to me, arranged with Lady Ilchester, in the girl&rsquo;s
      hearing, that we should make a match. My grandfather pledged his word to
      Janet that he would restore us to an amicable footing. He thought it a
      light task. Invitations were sent out to a large party at Riversley, and
      Janet came with all my gifts on her dress or in her pockets. The squire
      led the company to the gates of his stables; the gates opened, and a
      beautiful pony, with a side-saddle on, was trotted forth, amid cries of
      admiration. Then the squire put the bridle-reins in my hands, bidding me
      present it myself. I asked the name of the person. He pointed at Janet. I
      presented the pony to Janet, and said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s from the squire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She forgot, in her delight, our being at variance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, you stupid Harry, I&rsquo;m to thank you. He&rsquo;s a darling pony. I want
      to kiss you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I retired promptly, but the squire had heard her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Back, sir!&rsquo; he shouted, swearing by this and that. &lsquo;You slink from a
      kiss, and you&rsquo;re Beltham blood?
    </p>
    <p>
      Back to her, lad. Take it. Up with her in your arms or down on your knees.
      Take it manfully, somehow. See there, she &lsquo;s got it ready for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got a letter ready for you, Harry, to say&mdash;oh! so sorry for
      offending you,&rsquo; Janet whispered, when I reached the pony&rsquo;s head; &lsquo;and if
      you&rsquo;d rather not be kissed before people, then by-and-by, but do shake
      hands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pull the pony&rsquo;s mane,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;that will do as well. Observe&mdash;I
      pull, and now you pull.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet mechanically followed my actions. She grimaced, and whimpered, &lsquo;I
      could pull the pony&rsquo;s mane right out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t treat animals like your dolls,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran to the squire, and refused the pony. The squire&rsquo;s face changed
      from merry to black.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Young man,&rsquo; he addressed me, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t show that worse half of yours in
      genteel society, or, by the Lord! you won&rsquo;t carry Beltham buttons for
      long. This young lady, mind you, is a lady by birth both sides.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She thinks she is marriageable,&rsquo; said I; and walked away, leaving loud
      laughter behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But laughter did not console me for the public aspersion of him I loved. I
      walked off the grounds, and thought to myself it was quite time I should
      be moving. Wherever I stayed for any length of time I was certain to hear
      abuse of my father. Why not wander over the country with Kiomi, go to sea,
      mount the Andes, enlist in a Prussian regiment, and hear the soldiers tell
      tales of Frederick the Great? I walked over Kiomi&rsquo;s heath till dark, when
      one of our grooms on horseback overtook me, saying that the squire begged
      me to jump on the horse and ride home as quick as possible. Two other lads
      and the coachman were out scouring the country to find me, and the squire
      was anxious, it appeared. I rode home like a wounded man made to feel
      proud by victory, but with no one to stop the bleeding of his wounds: and
      the more my pride rose, the more I suffered pain. There at home sat my
      grandfather, dejected, telling me that the loss of me a second time would
      kill him, begging me to overlook his roughness, calling me his little
      Harry and his heir, his brave-spirited boy; yet I was too sure that a word
      of my father to him would have brought him very near another ejaculation
      concerning Beltham buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a fiery young fellow, I suspect,&rsquo; he said, when he had recovered
      his natural temper. &lsquo;I like you for it; pluck&rsquo;s Beltham. Have a will of
      your own. Sweat out the bad blood. Here, drink my health, Harry. You&rsquo;re
      three parts Beltham, at least, and it&rsquo;ll go hard if you&rsquo;re not all Beltham
      before I die. Old blood always wins that race, I swear. We &lsquo;re the oldest
      in the county.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damn the mixing. My father never let any of his daughters marry, if he
      could help it, nor&rsquo;ll I, bar rascals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here&rsquo;s to you, young Squire Beltham. Harry Lepel Beltham&mdash;does that
      suit ye? Anon, anon, as they say in the play. Take my name, and drop the
      Richmond no, drop the subject: we&rsquo;ll talk of it by-and-by.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So he wrestled to express his hatred of my father without offending me;
      and I studied him coldly, thinking that the sight of my father in beggar&rsquo;s
      clothes, raising a hand for me to follow his steps, would draw me forth,
      though Riversley should beseech me to remain clad in wealth.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. AN EVENING WITH CAPTAIN BULSTED
    </h2>
    <p>
      A dream that my father lay like a wax figure in a bed gave me thoughts of
      dying. I was ill and did not know it, and imagined that my despair at the
      foot of the stairs of ever reaching my room to lie down peacefully was the
      sign of death. My aunt Dorothy nursed me for a week: none but she and my
      dogs entered the room. I had only two faint wishes left in me: one that
      the squire should be kept out of my sight, the other that she would speak
      to me of my mother&rsquo;s love for my father. She happened to say, musing,
      &lsquo;Harry, you have your mother&rsquo;s heart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I said, &lsquo;No, my father&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      From that we opened a conversation, the sweetest I had ever had away from
      him, though she spoke shyly and told me very little. It was enough for me
      in the narrow world of my dogs&rsquo; faces, and the red-leaved creeper at the
      window, the fir-trees on the distant heath, and her hand clasping mine. My
      father had many faults, she said, but he had been cruelly used, or
      deceived, and he bore a grievous burden; and then she said, &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; in the voice one supposes of a ghost retiring, to my
      questions of his merits. I was refreshed and satisfied, like the parched
      earth with dews when it gets no rain, and I was soon well.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I walked among the household again, I found that my week of seclusion
      had endowed me with a singular gift; I found that I could see through
      everybody. Looking at the squire, I thought to myself, &lsquo;My father has
      faults, but he has been cruelly used,&rsquo; and immediately I forgave the old
      man; his antipathy to my father seemed a craze, and to account for it I
      lay in wait for his numerous illogical acts and words, and smiled visibly
      in contemplation of his rough unreasonable nature, and of my magnanimity.
      He caught the smile, and interpreted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grinning at me, Harry; have I made a slip in my grammar, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Who could feel any further sensitiveness at his fits of irritation,
      reading him as I did? I saw through my aunt: she was always in dread of a
      renewal of our conversation. I could see her ideas flutter like birds to
      escape me. And I penetrated the others who came in my way just as
      unerringly. Farmer Eckerthy would acknowledge, astonished, his mind was
      running on cricket when I taxed him with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Crops was the cart-load of my thoughts, Master Harry, but there was a bit
      o&rsquo; cricket in it, too, ne&rsquo;er a doubt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt&rsquo;s maid, Davis, was shocked by my discernment of the fact that she
      was in love, and it was useless for her to pretend the contrary, for I had
      seen her granting tender liberties to Lady Ilchester&rsquo;s footman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Sewis said gravely, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been to the witches, Master Harry&rsquo;; and
      others were sure &lsquo;I had got it from the gipsies off the common.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The maids were partly incredulous, but I perceived that they disbelieved
      as readily as they believed. With my latest tutor, the Rev. Simon Hart, I
      was not sufficiently familiar to offer him proofs of my extraordinary
      power; so I begged favours of him, and laid hot-house flowers on his table
      in the name of my aunt, and had the gratification of seeing him blush. His
      approval of my Latin exercise was verbal, and weak praise in comparison;
      besides I cared nothing for praises not referring to my grand natural
      accomplishment. &lsquo;And my father now is thinking of me!&rsquo; That was easy to
      imagine, but the certainty of it confirmed me in my conceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can you tell?&mdash;how is it possible for you to know people&rsquo;s
      thoughts?&rsquo; said Janet Ilchester, whose head was as open to me as a hat.
      She pretended to be rather more frightened of me than she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now you think you are flattering me!&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now you&rsquo;re asking yourself what you can do better than I can!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She said, &lsquo;Go on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      She charged me with being pulled up short.
    </p>
    <p>
      I denied it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Guess, guess!&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My reply petrified her. &lsquo;You were thinking that you are a lady by birth on
      both sides.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At first she refused to admit it. &lsquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t that, Harry, it wasn&rsquo;t
      really. I was thinking how clever you are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, after, not before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Harry, but you are clever. I wish I was half as clever. Fancy reading
      people&rsquo;s ideas! I can read my pony&rsquo;s, but that&rsquo;s different; I know by his
      ears. And as for my being a lady, of course I am, and so are you&mdash;I
      mean, a gentleman. I was thinking&mdash;now this is really what I was
      thinking&mdash;I wished your father lived near, that we might all be
      friends. I can&rsquo;t bear the squire when he talks.... And you quite as good
      as me, and better. Don&rsquo;t shake me off, Harry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook her in the gentlest manner, not suspecting that she had read my
      feelings fully as well as I her thoughts. Janet and I fell to talking of
      my father incessantly, and were constantly together. The squire caught one
      of my smiles rising, when he applauded himself lustily for the original
      idea of matching us; but the idea was no longer distasteful to me. It
      appeared to me that if I must some day be married, a wife who would enjoy
      my narratives, and travel over the four quarters of the globe, as Janet
      promised to do, in search of him I loved, would be the preferable person.
      I swore her to secresy; she was not to tell her brother Charley the
      subject we conversed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh dear, no!&rsquo; said she, and told him straightway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley, home for his winter holidays, blurted out at the squire&rsquo;s table:
      &lsquo;So, Harry Richmond, you&rsquo;re the cleverest fellow in the world, are you?
      There&rsquo;s Janet telling everybody your father&rsquo;s the cleverest next to you,
      and she&rsquo;s never seen him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How? hulloa, what &lsquo;s that?&rsquo; sang out the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Charley was speaking of my father, sir,&rsquo; I said, preparing for thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all rose. The squire looked as though an apoplectic seizure were coming
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t sit at my table again,&rsquo; he said, after a terrible struggle to be
      articulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand was stretched at me. I swung round to depart. &lsquo;No, no, not you;
      that fellow,&rsquo; he called, getting his arm level toward Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to intercede&mdash;the last who should have done it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You like to hear him, eh?&rsquo; said the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was ready to say that I did, but my aunt, whose courage was up when
      occasion summoned it, hushed the scene by passing the decanter to the
      squire, and speaking to him in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Biter&rsquo;s bit. I&rsquo;ve dished myself, that&rsquo;s clear,&rsquo; said Charley; and he
      spoke the truth, and such was his frankness that I forgave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and Janet were staying at Riversley. They left next morning, for the
      squire would not speak to him, nor I to Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I &lsquo;ll tell you what; there &lsquo;s no doubt about one thing,&rsquo; said Charley;
      &lsquo;Janet&rsquo;s right&mdash;some of those girls are tremendously deep: you&rsquo;re
      about the cleverest fellow I&rsquo;ve ever met in my life. I thought of working
      into the squire in a sort of collateral manner, you know. A cornetcy in
      the Dragoon Guards in a year or two. I thought the squire might do that
      for me without much damaging you;&mdash;perhaps a couple of hundred a
      year, just to reconcile me to a nose out of joint. For, upon my honour,
      the squire spoke of making me his heir&mdash;or words to that effect
      neatly conjugated&mdash;before you came back; and rather than be a curate
      like that Reverend Hart of yours, who hands raisins and almonds, and
      orange-flower biscuits to your aunt the way of all the Reverends who drop
      down on Riversley&mdash;I &lsquo;d betray my bosom friend. I&rsquo;m regularly &ldquo;hoist
      on my own petard,&rdquo; as they say in the newspapers. I&rsquo;m a curate and no
      mistake. You did it with a turn of the wrist, without striking out: and I
      like neat boxing. I bear no malice when I&rsquo;m floored neatly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes after he had spoken it would have been impossible for me to
      tell him that my simplicity and not my cleverness had caused his
      overthrow. From this I learnt that simplicity is the keenest weapon and a
      beautiful refinement of cleverness; and I affected it extremely. I pushed
      it so far that I could make the squire dance in his seat with suppressed
      fury and jealousy at my way of talking of Venice, and other Continental
      cities, which he knew I must have visited in my father&rsquo;s society; and
      though he raged at me and pshawed the Continent to the deuce, he was
      ready, out of sheer rivalry, to grant anything I pleased to covet. At
      every stage of my growth one or another of my passions was alert to twist
      me awry, and now I was getting a false self about me and becoming liker to
      the creature people supposed me to be, despising them for blockheads in my
      heart, as boys may who preserve a last trace of the ingenuousness denied
      to seasoned men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily my aunt wrote to Mr. Rippenger for the address of little Gus
      Temple&rsquo;s father, to invite my schoolfellow to stay a month at Riversley.
      Temple came, everybody liked him; as for me my delight was unbounded, and
      in spite of a feeling of superiority due to my penetrative capacity, and
      the suspicion it originated, that Temple might be acting the plain
      well-bred schoolboy he was, I soon preferred his pattern to my own. He
      confessed he had found me changed at first. His father, it appeared, was
      working him as hard at Latin as Mr. Hart worked me, and he sat down beside
      me under my tutor and stumbled at Tacitus after his fluent Cicero. I
      offered excuses for him to Mr. Hart, saying he would soon prove himself
      the better scholar. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s my old Richie!&rsquo; said Temple, fondling me on
      the shoulder, and my nonsensical airs fell away from me at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      We roamed the neighbourhood talking old school-days over, visiting houses,
      hunting and dancing, declaring every day we would write for Heriot to join
      us, instead of which we wrote a valentine to Julia Rippenger, and
      despatched a companion one composed in a very different spirit to her
      father. Lady Ilchester did us the favour to draw a sea-monster, an
      Andromeda, and a Perseus in the shape of a flying British hussar, for
      Julia&rsquo;s valentine. It seemed to us so successful that we scattered
      half-a-dozen over the neighbourhood, and rode round it on the morning of
      St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day to see the effect of them, meeting the postman on the
      road. He gave me two for myself. One was transparently from Janet, a
      provoking counterstroke of mine to her; but when I opened the other my
      heart began beating. The standard of Great Britain was painted in colours
      at the top; down each side, encricled in laurels, were kings and queens of
      England with their sceptres, and in the middle I read the initials, A.
      F-G. R. R., embedded in blue forget-me-hots. I could not doubt it was from
      my father. Riding out in the open air as I received it, I could fancy in
      my hot joy that it had dropped out of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s alive; I shall have him with me; I shall have him with me soon!&rsquo; I
      cried to Temple. &lsquo;Oh! why can&rsquo;t I answer him? where is he? what address?
      Let&rsquo;s ride to London. Don&rsquo;t you understand, Temple? This letter&rsquo;s from my
      father. He knows I&rsquo;m here. I&rsquo;ll find him, never mind what happens.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but,&rsquo; said Temple, &lsquo;if he knows where you are, and you don&rsquo;t know
      where he is, there&rsquo;s no good in your going off adventuring. If a fellow
      wants to be hit, the best thing he can do is to stop still.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Struck by the perspicacity of his views, I turned homeward. Temple had
      been previously warned by me to avoid speaking of my father at Riversley;
      but I was now in such a boiling state of happiness, believing that my
      father would certainly appear as he had done at Dipwell farm, brilliant
      and cheerful, to bear me away to new scenes and his own dear society, that
      I tossed the valentine to my aunt across the breakfast-table, laughing and
      telling her to guess the name of the sender. My aunt flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Bannerbridge?&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stranger was present. The squire introduced us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My grandson, Harry Richmond, Captain William Bulsted, frigate Polyphemus;
      Captain Bulsted, Master Augustus Temple.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For the sake of conversation, Temple asked him if his ship was fully
      manned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All but a mate,&rsquo; said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew him by reputation as the brother of Squire Gregory Bulsted of
      Bulsted, notorious for his attachment to my aunt, and laughing-stock of
      the county.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you&rsquo;ve got a valentine,&rsquo; the captain addressed me. &lsquo;I went on shore at
      Rio last year on this very day of the month, just as lively as you
      youngsters for one. Saltwater keeps a man&rsquo;s youth in pickle. No valentine
      for me! Paid off my ship yesterday at Spithead, and here I am again on
      Valentine&rsquo;s Day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple and I stared hard at a big man with a bronzed skin and a rubicund
      laugh who expected to receive valentines.
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt thrust the letter back to me secretly. &lsquo;It must be from a lady,&rsquo; 
      said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, who&rsquo;d have a valentine from any but a lady?&rsquo; exclaimed the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire winked at me to watch his guest. Captain Bulsted fed heartily;
      he was thoroughly a sailor-gentleman, between the old school and the new,
      and, as I perceived, as far gone in love with my aunt as his brother was.
      Presently Sewis entered carrying a foaming tankard of old ale, and he and
      the captain exchanged a word or two upon Jamaica.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, when you&rsquo;ve finished that washy tea of yours, take a draught of our
      October, brewed here long before you were a lieutenant, captain,&rsquo; said the
      squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, sir,&rsquo; the captain replied; &lsquo;I know that ale; a moment, and I
      will gladly. I wish to preserve my faculties; I don&rsquo;t wish to have it
      supposed that I speak under fermenting influences. Sewis, hold by, if you
      please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt made an effort to retire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, fair play; stay,&rsquo; said the squire, trying to frown, but
      twinkling; my aunt tried to smile, and sat as if on springs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Beltham,&rsquo; the captain bowed to her, and to each one as he spoke,
      &lsquo;Squire Beltham, Mr. Harry Richmond; Mr. Temple; my ship was paid off
      yesterday, and till a captain&rsquo;s ship is paid off, he &lsquo;s not his own
      master, you are aware. If you think my behaviour calls for comment,
      reflect, I beseech you, on the nature of a sailor&rsquo;s life. A three-years&rsquo; 
      cruise in a cabin is pretty much equivalent to the same amount of time
      spent in a coffin, I can assure you; with the difference that you&rsquo;re hard
      at work thinking all the time like the&mdash;hum.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, he thinks hard enough,&rsquo; the squire struck in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon me, sir; like the&mdash;hum&mdash;plumb-line on a leeshore, I
      meant to observe. This is now the third&mdash;the fourth occasion on which
      I have practised the observance of paying my first visit to Riversley to
      know my fate, that I might not have it on my conscience that I had missed
      a day, a minute, as soon as I was a free man on English terra firma. My
      brother Greg and I were brought up in close association with Riversley.
      One of the Beauties of Riversley we lost! One was left, and we both tried
      our luck with her; honourably, in turn, each of us, nothing underhand;
      above-board, on the quarter-deck, before all the company. I &lsquo;ll say it of
      my brother, I can say it of myself. Greg&rsquo;s chances, I need not remark, are
      superior to mine; he is always in port. If he wins, then I tell him&mdash;&ldquo;God
      bless you, my boy; you&rsquo;ve won the finest woman, the handsomest, and the
      best, in or out of Christendom!&rdquo; But my chance is my property, though it
      may be value only one farthing coin of the realm, and there is always pity
      for poor sinners in the female bosom. Miss Beltham, I trespass on your
      kind attention. If I am to remain a bachelor and you a maiden lady, why,
      the will of heaven be done! If you marry another, never mind who the man,
      there&rsquo;s my stock to the fruit of the union, never mind what the sex. But,
      if you will have one so unworthy of you as me, my hand and heart are at
      your feet, ma&rsquo;am, as I have lost no time in coming to tell you.&rsquo; So
      Captain Bulsted concluded. Our eyes were directed on my aunt. The squire
      bade her to speak out, for she had his sanction to act according to her
      judgement and liking.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said, with a gracefulness that gave me a little aching of pity for the
      poor captain: &lsquo;I am deeply honoured by you, Captain Bulsted, but it is not
      my intention to marry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain stood up, and bowing humbly, replied &lsquo;I am ever your servant,
      ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt quitted the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now for the tankard, Sewis,&rsquo; said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually the bottom of the great tankard turned up to the ceiling. He
      drank to the last drop in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire asked him whether he found consolation in that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain sighed prodigiously and said: &lsquo;It &lsquo;s a commencement, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Egad, it&rsquo;s a commencement &lsquo;d be something like a final end to any dozen
      of our fellows round about here. I&rsquo;ll tell you what: if stout stomachs
      gained the day in love-affairs, I suspect you&rsquo;d run a good race against
      the male half of our county, William. And a damned good test of a man&rsquo;s
      metal, I say it is! What are you going to do to-day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going to get drunk, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you might do worse. Then, stop here, William, and give my old Port
      the preference. No tongue in the morning, I promise you, and pleasant
      dreams at night.&rsquo; The captain thanked him cordially, but declined, saying
      that he would rather make a beast of himself in another place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire vainly pressed his hospitality by assuring him of perfect
      secresy on our part, as regarded my aunt, and offering him Sewis and one
      of the footmen to lift him to bed. &lsquo;You are very good, squire,&rsquo; said the
      captain; &lsquo;nothing but a sense of duty restrains me. I am bound to convey
      the information to my brother that the coast is clear for him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, fall light, and for&rsquo;ard,&rsquo; said the squire, shaking him by the
      hand. Forty years ago a gentleman, a baronet, had fallen on the back of
      his head and never recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, ay, launch stern foremost, if you like!&rsquo; said the captain, nodding;
      &lsquo;no, no, I don&rsquo;t go into port pulled by the tail, my word for it, squire;
      and good day to you, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No ill will about this bothering love-business of yours, William?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On my soul, sir, I cherish none.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple and I followed him out of the house, fascinated by his manners and
      oddness. He invited us to jump into the chariot beside him. We were
      witnesses of the meeting between him and his brother, a little sniffling
      man, as like the captain as a withered nut is like a milky one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Same luck, William?&rsquo; said Squire Gregory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a point of change in the wind, Greg,&rsquo; said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      They wrenched hands thereupon, like two carpet-shakers, with a report, and
      much in a similar attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These young gentlemen will testify to you solemnly, Greg, that I took no
      unfair advantage,&rsquo; said the captain; &lsquo;no whispering in passages, no
      appointments in gardens, no letters. I spoke out. Bravely, man! And now,
      Greg, referring to the state of your cellar, our young friends here mean
      to float with us to-night. It is now half-past eleven A.M. Your
      dinner-hour the same as usual, of course? Therefore at four P.M. the hour
      of execution. And come, Greg, you and I will visit the cellar. A dozen and
      half of light and half-a-dozen of the old family&mdash;that will be about
      the number of bottles to give me my quietus, and you yours&mdash;all of
      us! And you, young gentlemen, take your guns or your rods, and back and be
      dressed by the four bell, or you &lsquo;ll not find the same man in Billy
      Bulsted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple was enraptured with him. He declared he had been thinking seriously
      for a long time of entering the Navy, and his admiration of the captain
      must have given him an intuition of his character, for he persuaded me to
      send to Riversley for our evening-dress clothes, appearing in which at the
      dinner-table, we received the captain&rsquo;s compliments, as being gentlemen
      who knew how to attire ourselves to suit an occasion. The occasion, Squire
      Gregory said, happened to him too often for him to distinguish it by the
      cut of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I observe, nevertheless, Greg, that you have a black tie round your neck
      instead of a red one,&rsquo; said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then it came there by accident,&rsquo; said Squire Gregory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Accident! There&rsquo;s no such thing as accident. If I wander out of the house
      with a half dozen or so in me, and topple into the brook, am I
      accidentally drowned? If a squall upsets my ship, is she an accidental
      residue of spars and timber and old iron? If a woman refuses me, is that
      an accident? There&rsquo;s a cause for every disaster: too much cargo, want of
      foresight, want of pluck. Pooh! when I&rsquo;m hauled prisoner into a foreign
      port in time of war, you may talk of accidents. Mr. Harry Richmond, Mr.
      Temple, I have the accidental happiness of drinking to your healths in a
      tumbler of hock wine. Nominative, hic, haec, hoc.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Squire Gregory carried on the declension, not without pride. The Vocative
      confused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Claret will do for the Vocative,&rsquo; said the captain, gravely; &lsquo;the more so
      as there is plenty of it at your table, Greg. Ablative hoc, hac, hoc,
      which sounds as if the gentleman had become incapable of speech beyond the
      name of his wine. So we will abandon the declension of the article for a
      dash of champagne, which there&rsquo;s no declining, I hope. Wonderful men,
      those Romans! They fought their ships well, too. A question to you, Greg.
      Those heathen Pagan dogs had a religion that encouraged them to swear.
      Now, my experience of life pronounces it to be a human necessity to rap
      out an oath here and there. What do you say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Squire Gregory said: &lsquo;Drinking, and no thinking, at dinner, William.&rsquo; The
      captain pledged him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I &lsquo;ll take the opportunity, as we&rsquo;re not on board ship, of drinking to
      you, sir, now,&rsquo; Temple addressed the captain, whose face was resplendent;
      and he bowed, and drank, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As we are not on board ship? I like you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple thanked him for the compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No compliment, my lad. You see me in my weakness, and you have the
      discernment to know me for something better than I seem. You promise to
      respect me on my own quarter-deck. You are of the right stuff. Do I speak
      correctly, Mr. Harry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Temple is my dear friend,&rsquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he would not be so if not of the right stuff! Good! That &lsquo;s a way of
      putting much in little. By Jove! a royal style.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Harry&rsquo;s a royal fellow!&rsquo; said Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all drank to one another. The captain&rsquo;s eyes scrutinized me
      speculatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This boy might have been yours or mine, Greg,&rsquo; I heard him say in a
      faltering rough tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      They forgot the presence of Temple and me, but spoke as if they thought
      they were whispering. The captain assured his brother that Squire Beltham
      had given him as much fair play as one who holds a balance. Squire Gregory
      doubted it, and sipped and kept his nose at his wineglass, crabbedly
      repeating his doubts of it. The captain then remarked, that doubting it,
      his conscience permitted him to use stratagems, though he, the captain,
      not doubting it, had no such permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I count I run away with her every night of my life,&rsquo; said Squire Gregory.
      &lsquo;Nothing comes of it but empty bottles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Court her, serenade her,&rsquo; said the captain; &lsquo;blockade the port, lay siege
      to the citadel. I&rsquo;d give a year of service for your chances, Greg. Half a
      word from her, and you have your horses ready.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s past po&rsquo;chaises,&rsquo; Squire Gregory sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s to be won by a bold stroke, brother Greg.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Lord, no! She&rsquo;s past po&rsquo;chaises.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Humph! it&rsquo;s come to be half-bottle, half-beauty, with your worship, Greg,
      I suspect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. I tell you, William, she&rsquo;s got her mind on that fellow. You can&rsquo;t
      po&rsquo;chay her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After he jilted her for her sister? Wrong, Greg, wrong. You are muddled.
      She has a fright about matrimony&mdash;a common thing at her age, I am
      told. Where&rsquo;s the man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the Bench, of course. Where&rsquo;d you have him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I, sir? If I knew my worst enemy to be there, I&rsquo;d send him six dozen of
      the best in my cellar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple shot a walnut at me. I pretended to be meditating carelessly, and I
      had the heat and roar of a conflagration round my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the captain said, &lsquo;Are you sure the man&rsquo;s in the Bench?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cock,&rsquo; Squire Gregory replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He had money from his wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he had the wheels to make it go.&rsquo; Here they whispered in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the Billings were as rich as the Belthams,&rsquo; said the captain, aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty nigh, William.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s our curse, Greg. Money settled on their male issue, and money in
      hand; by the Lord! we&rsquo;ve always had the look of a pair of highwaymen
      lurking for purses, when it was the woman, the woman, penniless, naked,
      mean, destitute; nothing but the woman we wanted. And there was one apiece
      for us. Greg, old boy, when will the old county show such another couple
      of Beauties! Greg, sir, you&rsquo;re not half a man, or you&rsquo;d have carried her,
      with your opportunities. The fellow&rsquo;s in the Bench, you say? How are you
      cocksure of that, Mr. Greg?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Company,&rsquo; was the answer; and the captain turned to Temple and me,
      apologizing profusely for talking over family matters with his brother
      after a separation of three years. I had guessed but hastily at the
      subject of their conversation until they mentioned the Billings, the
      family of my maternal grandmother. The name was like a tongue of fire
      shooting up in a cloud of smoke: I saw at once that the man in the Bench
      must be my father, though what the Bench was exactly, and where it was, I
      had no idea, and as I was left to imagination I became, as usual, childish
      in my notions, and brooded upon thoughts of the Man in the Iron Mask;
      things I dared not breathe to Temple, of whose manly sense I stood in awe
      when under these distracting influences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Remember our feast in the combe?&rsquo; I sang across the table to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never forget it!&rsquo; said he; and we repeated the tale of the goose at
      Rippenger&rsquo;s school to our entertainers, making them laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And next morning Richie ran off with a gipsy girl,&rsquo; said Temple; and I
      composed a narrative of my wanderings with Kiomi, much more amusing than
      the real one. The captain vowed he would like to have us both on board his
      ship, but that times were too bad for him to offer us a prospect of
      promotion. &lsquo;Spin round the decanters,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;now&rsquo;s the hour for them
      to go like a humming-top, and each man lend a hand: whip hard, my lads.
      It&rsquo;s once in three years, hurrah! and the cause is a cruel woman. Toast
      her; but no name. Here&rsquo;s to the nameless Fair! For it&rsquo;s not my intention
      to marry, says she, and, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;m a man of honour or I&rsquo;d catch you
      tight, my nut-brown maid, and clap you into a cage, fal-lal, like a
      squirrel; to trot the wheel of mat-trimony. Shame to the first man down!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That won&rsquo;t be I,&rsquo; said Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be me, sir, me,&rsquo; the captain corrected his grammar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon me, Captain Bulsted; the verb &ldquo;To be&rdquo; governs the nominative case
      in our climate,&rsquo; said Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;m nominative hic... I say, sir, I&rsquo;m in the tropics, Mr. Tem ...
      Mr. Tempus. Point of honour, not forget a man&rsquo;s name. Rippenger, your
      schoolmaster? Mr. Rippenger, you&rsquo;ve knocked some knowledge into this young
      gentleman.&rsquo; Temple and I took counsel together hastily; we cried in a
      breath: &lsquo;Here &lsquo;s to Julia Rippenger, the prettiest, nicest girl living!&rsquo; 
      and we drank to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Julia!&rsquo; the captain echoed us. &lsquo;I join your toast, gentlemen. Mr.
      Richmond, Mr. Tempus-Julia! By all that&rsquo;s holy, she floats a sinking ship!
      Julia consoles me for the fairest, cruellest woman alive. A rough sailor,
      Julia! at your feet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain fell commendably forward. Squire Gregory had already dropped.
      Temple and I tried to meet, but did not accomplish it till next morning at
      breakfast. A couple of footmen carried us each upstairs in turn, as if
      they were removing furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of this strange evening came my discovery of my father, and the
      captain&rsquo;s winning of a wife.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. AN EXPEDITION
    </h2>
    <p>
      I wondered audibly where the Bench was when Temple and I sat together
      alone at Squire Gregory&rsquo;s breakfast-table next morning, very thirsty for
      tea. He said it was a place in London, but did not add the sort of place,
      only that I should soon be coming to London with him; and I remarked,
      &lsquo;Shall I?&rsquo; and smiled at him, as if in a fit of careless affection. Then
      he talked runningly of the theatres and pantomimes and London&rsquo;s charms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fear I had of this Bench made me passingly conscious of Temple&rsquo;s
      delicacy in not repeating its name, though why I feared it there was
      nothing to tell me. I must have dreamed of it just before waking, and I
      burned for reasonable information concerning it. Temple respected my
      father too much to speak out the extent of his knowledge on the subject,
      so we drank our tea with the grandeur of London for our theme, where,
      Temple assured me, you never had a headache after a carouse overnight: a
      communication that led me to think the country a far less favourable place
      of abode for gentlemen. We quitted the house without seeing our host or
      the captain, and greatly admired by the footmen, the maids, and the grooms
      for having drunk their masters under the table, which it could not be
      doubted that we had done, as Temple modestly observed while we sauntered
      off the grounds under the eyes of the establishment. We had done it
      fairly, too, with none of those Jack the Giant-Killer tricks my
      grandfather accused us of.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire would not, and he could not, believe our story until he heard
      the confession from the mouth of the captain. After that he said we were
      men and heroes, and he tipped us both, much to Janet Ilchester&rsquo;s
      advantage, for the squire was a royal giver, and Temple&rsquo;s money had
      already begun to take the same road as mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple, in fact, was falling desperately in love; for this reason he
      shrank from quitting Riversley. I perceived it as clearly as a thing seen
      through a windowpane. He was always meditating upon dogs, and what might
      be the price of this dog or that, and whether lapdogs were good
      travellers. The fashionable value of pugs filled him with a sort of
      despair. &lsquo;My goodness!&rsquo; he used an exclamation more suitable to women,
      &lsquo;forty or fifty pounds you say one costs, Richie?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I pretended to estimate the probable cost of one. &lsquo;Yes, about that; but
      I&rsquo;ll buy you one, one day or other, Temple.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The dear little fellow coloured hot; he was too much in earnest to laugh
      at the absurdity of his being supposed to want a pug for himself, and
      walked round me, throwing himself into attitudes with shrugs and loud
      breathings. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t... don&rsquo;t think that I... I care for nothing but
      Newfoundlands and mastiffs,&rsquo; said he. He went on shrugging and kicking up
      his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Girls like pugs,&rsquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fancy they do,&rsquo; said Temple, with a snort of indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I suggested, &lsquo;A pocket-knife for the hunting-field is a very good
      thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think so?&rsquo; was Temple&rsquo;s rejoinder, and I saw he was dreadfully
      afraid of my speaking the person&rsquo;s name for whom it would be such a very
      good thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can get one for thirty shillings. We&rsquo;ll get one when we&rsquo;re in London.
      They&rsquo;re just as useful for women as they are for us, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, of course they are, if they hunt,&rsquo; said Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And we mustn&rsquo;t lose time,&rsquo; I drew him to the point I had at heart, &lsquo;for
      hunting &lsquo;ll soon be over. It &lsquo;s February, mind!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, lots of time!&rsquo; Temple cried out, and on every occasion when I tried
      to make him understand that I was bursting to visit London, he kept
      evading me, simply because he hated saying good-bye to Janet Ilchester.
      His dulness of apprehension in not perceiving that I could not commit a
      breach of hospitality by begging him downright to start, struck me as
      extraordinary. And I was so acute. I saw every single idea in his head,
      every shift of, his mind, and how he half knew that he profited by my
      shunning to say flatly I desired to set out upon the discovery of the
      Bench. He took the benefit of my shamefacedness, for which I daily
      punished his. I really felt that I was justified in giving my irritability
      an airing by curious allusions to Janet; yet, though I made him wince, it
      was impossible to touch his conscience. He admitted to having repeatedly
      spoken of London&rsquo;s charms, and &lsquo;Oh, yes! you and I&rsquo;ll go back together,
      Richie,&rsquo; and saying that satisfied him: he doubled our engagements with
      Janet that afternoon, and it was a riding party, a dancing-party, and a
      drawing of a pond for carp, and we over to Janet, and Janet over to us,
      until I grew so sick of her I was incapable of summoning a spark of
      jealousy in order the better to torture Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, he was a quick-witted boy. Well, I one day heard Janet address my big
      dog, Ajax, in the style she usually employed to inform her hearers, and
      especially the proprietor, that she coveted a thing: &lsquo;Oh, you own dear
      precious pet darling beauty! if I might only feed you every day of my life
      I should be happy! I curtsey to him every time I see him. If I were his
      master, the men should all off hats, and the women all curtsey, to Emperor
      Ajax, my dog! my own! my great, dear irresistible love! Then she nodded at
      me, &lsquo;I would make them, though.&rsquo; And then at Temple, &lsquo;You see if I
      wouldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ajax was a source of pride to me. However, I heard Temple murmur, in a
      tone totally unlike himself, &lsquo;He would be a great protection to you&rsquo;; and
      I said to him, &lsquo;You know, Temple, I shall be going to London to-morrow or
      the next day, not later: I don&rsquo;t know when I shall be back. I wish you
      would dispose of the dog just as you like: get him a kind master or
      mistress, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I sacrificed my dog to bring Temple to his senses. I thought it would
      touch him to see how much I could sacrifice just to get an excuse for
      begging him to start. He did not even thank me. Ajax soon wore one of
      Janet&rsquo;s collars, like two or three other of the Riversley dogs, and I had
      the satisfaction of hearing Temple accept my grandfather&rsquo;s invitation for
      a further fortnight. And, meanwhile, I was the one who was charged with
      going about looking lovelorn! I smothered my feelings and my reflections
      on the wisdom of people.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last my aunt Dorothy found the means of setting me at liberty on the
      road to London. We had related to her how Captain Bulsted toasted Julia
      Rippenger, and we had both declared in joke that we were sure the captain
      wished to be introduced to her. My aunt reserved her ideas on the subject,
      but by-and-by she proposed to us to ride over to Julia, and engage her to
      come and stay at Riversley for some days. Kissing me, my aunt said, &lsquo;She
      was my Harry&rsquo;s friend when he was an outcast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The words revived my affection for Julia. Strong in the sacred sense of
      gratitude, I turned on Temple, reproaching him with selfish forgetfulness
      of her good heart and pretty face. Without defending himself, as he might
      have done, he entreated me to postpone our journey for a day; he and Janet
      had some appointment. Here was given me a noble cause and matter I need
      not shrink from speaking of. I lashed Temple in my aunt&rsquo;s presence with a
      rod of real eloquence that astonished her, and him, and myself too; and as
      he had a sense of guilt not quite explicable in his mind, he consented to
      bear what was in reality my burden; for Julia had distinguished me and not
      him with all the signs of affection, and of the two I had the more
      thoroughly forgotten her; I believe Temple was first in toasting her at
      Squire Gregory&rsquo;s table. There is nothing like a pent-up secret of the
      heart for accumulating powers of speech; I mean in youth. The mental
      distilling process sets in later, and then you have irony instead of
      eloquence. From brooding on my father, and not daring to mention his name
      lest I should hear evil of it, my thoughts were a proud family, proud of
      their origin, proud of their isolation,&mdash;and not to be able to divine
      them was for the world to confess itself basely beneath their level. But,
      when they did pour out, they were tremendous, as Temple found. This
      oratorical display of mine gave me an ascendancy over him. He adored
      eloquence, not to say grandiloquence: he was the son of a barrister. &lsquo;Let
      &lsquo;s go and see her at once, Richie,&rsquo; he said of Julia. &lsquo;I &lsquo;m ready to be
      off as soon as you like; I&rsquo;m ready to do anything that will please you&rsquo;;
      which was untrue, but it was useless to tell him so. I sighed at my sad
      gift of penetration, and tossed the fresh example of it into the treasury
      of vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Temple,&rsquo; said I, dissembling a little; &lsquo;I tell you candidly: you won&rsquo;t
      please me by doing anything disagreeable to you. A dog pulled by the
      collar is not much of a companion. I start for Julia to-morrow before
      daylight. If you like your bed best, stop there; and mind you amuse Janet
      for me duing my absence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let any one make comparisons between us,&rsquo; Temple
      muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped dozens of similar remarks, and sometimes talked downright
      flattery, I had so deeply impressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We breakfasted by candle-light, and rode away on a frosty foggy morning,
      keeping our groom fifty yards to the rear, a laughable sight, with both
      his coat-pockets bulging, a couple of Riversley turnover pasties in one,
      and a bottle of champagne in the other, for our lunch on the road. Now and
      then, when near him, we galloped for the fun of seeing him nurse the
      bottle-pocket. He was generally invisible. Temple did not think it strange
      that we should be riding out in an unknown world with only a little ring,
      half a stone&rsquo;s-throw clear around us, and blots of copse, and queer
      vanishing cottages, and hard grey meadows, fir-trees wonderfully
      magnified, and larches and birches rigged like fairy ships, all starting
      up to us as we passed, and melting instantly. One could have fancied the
      fir-trees black torches. And here the shoulder of a hill invited us to
      race up to the ridge: some way on we came to crossroads, careless of our
      luck in hitting the right one: yonder hung a village church in the air,
      and church-steeple piercing ever so high; and out of the heart of the mist
      leaped a brook, and to hear it at one moment, and then to have the sharp
      freezing silence in one&rsquo;s ear, was piercingly weird. It all tossed the
      mind in my head like hay on a pitchfork. I forgot the existence of
      everything but what I loved passionately,&mdash;and that had no shape, was
      like a wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up on a knoll of firs in the middle of a heath, glowing rosy in the frost,
      we dismounted to lunch, leaning against the warm saddles, Temple and I,
      and Uberly, our groom, who reminded me of a certain tramp of my
      acquaintance in his decided preference of beer to champagne; he drank,
      though, and sparkled after his draught. No sooner were we on horseback
      again&mdash;ere the flanks of the dear friendly brutes were in any way
      cool&mdash;than Temple shouted enthusiastically, &lsquo;Richie, we shall do it
      yet! I&rsquo;ve been funking, but now I&rsquo;m sure we shall do it. Janet said,
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of my coming over to dine at Riversley if Harry Richmond
      and you don&rsquo;t come home before ten or eleven o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo; I told her we&rsquo;d do
      it by dinner-time: Don&rsquo;t you like Janet, Richie?&mdash;That is, if our
      horses&rsquo; hic-haec-hocks didn&rsquo;t get strained on this hard
      nominative-plural-masculine of the article road. Don&rsquo;t you fancy yourself
      dining with the captain, Richie? Dative huic, says old Squire Gregory. I
      like to see him at dinner, because he loves the smell of his wine. Oh!
      it&rsquo;s nothing to boast of, but we did drink them under the table, it can&rsquo;t
      be denied. Janet heard of it. Hulloa! you talk of a hunting-knife. What do
      you say to a pair of skates? Here we are in for a frost of six weeks. It
      strikes me, a pair of skates...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the champagne in Temple. In me it did not bubble to speech, and I
      soon drew him on at a pace that rendered conversation impossible. Uberly
      shouted after us to spare the horses&rsquo; legs. We heard him twice out of the
      deepening fog. I called to Temple that he was right, we should do it.
      Temple hurrahed rather breathlessly. At the end of an hour I pulled up at
      an inn, where I left the horses to be groomed and fed, and walked away
      rapidly as if I knew the town, Temple following me with perfect
      confidence, and, indeed, I had no intention to deceive him. We entered a
      new station of a railway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Temple, &lsquo;the rest of the way by rail.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When the railway clerk asked me what place I wanted tickets for, London
      sprang to my mouth promptly in a murmur, and taking the tickets I replied
      to Temple,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The rest of the way by rail. Uberly&rsquo;s sure to stop at that inn&rsquo;; but my
      heart beat as the carriages slid away with us; an affectionate
      commiseration for Temple touched me when I heard him count on our being
      back at Riversley in time to dress for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed aloud at the idea of our plumping down on Rippenger&rsquo;s school,
      getting a holiday for the boys, tipping them, and then off with Julia,
      exactly like two Gods of the Mythology, Apollo and Mercury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I often used to think they had the jolliest lives that ever were lived,&rsquo; 
      he said, and trying to catch glimpses of the country, and musing, and
      singing, he continued to feel like one of those blissful Gods until wonder
      at the passage of time supervened. Amazement, when he looked at my watch,
      struck him dumb. Ten minutes later we were in yellow fog, then in brown.
      Temple stared at both windows and at me; he jumped from his seat and fell
      on it, muttering, &lsquo;No; nonsense! I say!&rsquo; but he had accurately recognized
      London&rsquo;s fog. I left him unanswered to bring up all his senses, which the
      railway had outstripped, for the contemplation of this fact, that we two
      were in the city of London.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. THE GREAT FOG AND THE FIRE AT MIDNIGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was London city, and the Bench was the kernel of it to me. I throbbed
      with excitement, though I sat looking out of the windows into the
      subterranean atmosphere quite still and firm. When you think long
      undividedly of a single object it gathers light, and when you draw near it
      in person the strange thing to your mind is the absence of that light; but
      I, approaching it in this dense fog, seemed to myself to be only thinking
      of it a little more warmly than usual, and instead of fading it reversed
      the process, and became, from light, luminous. Not being able, however, to
      imagine the Bench a happy place, I corrected the excess of brightness and
      gave its walls a pine-torch glow; I set them in the middle of a great
      square, and hung the standard of England drooping over them in a sort of
      mournful family pride. Then, because I next conceived it a foreign kind of
      place, different altogether from that home growth of ours, the Tower of
      London, I topped it with a multitude of domes of pumpkin or turban shape,
      resembling the Kremlin of Moscow, which had once leapt up in the eye of
      Winter, glowing like a million pine-torches, and flung shadows of
      stretching red horses on the black smoke-drift. But what was the Kremlin,
      that had seen a city perish, to this Bench where my father languished!
      There was no comparing them for tragic horror. And the Kremlin had
      snow-fields around it; this Bench was caught out of sight, hemmed in by an
      atmosphere thick as Charon breathed; it might as well be underground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s London,&rsquo; Temple went on, correcting his incorrigible doubts
      about it. He jumped on the platform; we had to call out not to lose one
      another. &lsquo;I say, Richie, this is London,&rsquo; he said, linking his arm in
      mine: &lsquo;you know by the size of the station; and besides, there&rsquo;s the fog.
      Oh! it&rsquo;s London. We&rsquo;ve overshot it, we&rsquo;re positively in London.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I could spare no sympathy for his feelings, and I did not respond to his
      inquiring looks. Now that we were here I certainly wished myself away,
      though I would not have retreated, and for awhile I was glad of the
      discomforts besetting me; my step was hearty as I led on, meditating upon
      asking some one the direction to the Bench presently. We had to walk, and
      it was nothing but traversing on a slippery pavement atmospheric circles
      of black brown and brown red, and sometimes a larger circle of pale
      yellow; the colours of old bruised fruits, medlars, melons, and the smell
      of them; nothing is more desolate. Neither of us knew where we were, nor
      where we were going. We struggled through an interminable succession of
      squalid streets, from the one lamp visible to its neighbour in the
      darkness: you might have fancied yourself peering at the head of an old
      saint on a smoky canvas; it was like the painting of light rather than
      light. Figures rushed by; we saw no faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple spoke solemnly: &lsquo;Our dinner-hour at home is half-past six.&rsquo; A
      street-boy overheard him and chaffed him. Temple got the worst of it, and
      it did him good, for he had the sweetest nature in the world. We declined
      to be attended by link-boys; they would have hurt our sense of
      independence. Possessed of a sovereign faith that, by dint of resolution,
      I should ultimately penetrate to the great square enclosing the Bench, I
      walked with the air of one who had the map of London in his eye and could
      thread it blindfold. Temple was thereby deceived into thinking that I must
      somehow have learnt the direction I meant to take, and knew my way, though
      at the slightest indication of my halting and glancing round his
      suspicions began to boil, and he was for asking some one the name of the
      ground we stood on: he murmured, &lsquo;Fellows get lost in London.&rsquo; By this
      time he clearly understood that I had come to London on purpose: he could
      not but be aware of the object of my coming, and I was too proud, and he
      still too delicate, to allude to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fog choked us. Perhaps it took away the sense of hunger by filling us
      as if we had eaten a dinner of soot. We had no craving to eat until long
      past the dinner-hour in Temple&rsquo;s house, and then I would rather have
      plunged into a bath and a bed than have been requested to sit at a feast;
      Temple too, I fancy. We knew we were astray without speaking of it. Temple
      said, &lsquo;I wish we hadn&rsquo;t drunk that champagne.&rsquo; It seemed to me years since
      I had tasted the delicious crushing of the sweet bubbles in my mouth. But
      I did not blame them; I was after my father: he, dear little fellow, had
      no light ahead except his devotion to me: he must have had a touch of
      conscious guilt regarding his recent behaviour, enough to hold him from
      complaining formally. He complained of a London without shops and lights,
      wondered how any one could like to come to it in a fog, and so forth; and
      again regretted our having drunk champagne in the morning; a sort of
      involuntary whimpering easily forgiven to him, for I knew he had a gallant
      heart. I determined, as an act of signal condescension, to accost the
      first person we met, male or female, for Temple&rsquo;s sake. Having come to
      this resolve, which was to be an open confession that I had misled him,
      wounding to my pride, I hoped eagerly for the hearing of a footfall. We
      were in a labyrinth of dark streets where no one was astir. A wretched dog
      trotted up to us, followed at our heels a short distance, and left us as
      if he smelt no luck about us; our cajoleries were unavailing to keep that
      miserable companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sinbad escaped from the pit by tracking a lynx,&rsquo; I happened to remark.
      Temple would not hear of Sinbad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, come, we&rsquo;re not Mussulmen,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;I declare, Richie, if I saw a
      church open, I&rsquo;d go in and sleep there. Were you thinking of tracking the
      dog, then? Beer may be had somewhere. We shall have to find an hotel. What
      can the time be?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I owed it to him to tell him, so I climbed a lamppost and spelt out the
      hour by my watch. When I descended we were three. A man had his hands on
      Temple&rsquo;s shoulders, examining his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now speak,&rsquo; the man said, roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was interposing, but Temple cried, &lsquo;All right, Richie, we are two to
      one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man groaned. I asked him what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My son! I&rsquo;ve lost my son,&rsquo; the man replied, and walked away; and he would
      give no answer to our questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I caught hold of the lamp-post, overcome. I meant to tell Temple, in
      response to the consoling touch of his hand, that I hoped the poor, man
      would discover his son, but said instead, &lsquo;I wish we could see the Bench
      to-night.&rsquo; Temple exclaimed, &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; pretending by his tone of voice that we
      had recently discussed our chance of it, and then he ventured to inform me
      that he imagined he had heard of the place being shut up after a certain
      hour of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart felt released, and gushed with love for him. &lsquo;Very well, Temple,&rsquo; 
      I said: &lsquo;then we&rsquo;ll wait till tomorrow, and strike out for some hotel
      now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Off we went at a furious pace. Saddlebank&rsquo;s goose was reverted to by both
      of us with an exchange of assurances that we should meet a dish the fellow
      to it before we slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As for life,&rsquo; said I, as soon as the sharp pace had fetched my breathing
      to a regular measure, &lsquo;adventures are what I call life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple assented. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re capital, if you only see the end of them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We talked of Ulysses and Penelope. Temple blamed him for leaving Calypso.
      I thought Ulysses was right, otherwise we should have had no slaying of
      the Suitors but Temple shyly urged that to have a Goddess caring for you
      (and she was handsomer than Penelope, who must have been an oldish woman)
      was something to make you feel as you do on a hunting morning, when there
      are half-a-dozen riding-habits speckling the field&mdash;a whole glorious
      day your own among them! This view appeared to me very captivating, save
      for an obstruction in my mind, which was, that Goddesses were always
      conceived by me as statues. They talked and they moved, it was true, but
      the touch of them was marble; and they smiled and frowned, but they had no
      variety they were never warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I thought that!&rsquo; muttered Temple, puffing at the raw fog. He admitted
      he had thought just the contrary, and that the cold had suggested to him
      the absurdity of leaving a Goddess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here, Temple,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;has it never struck you? I won&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m
      like him. It&rsquo;s true I&rsquo;ve always admired Ulysses; he could fight best, talk
      best, and plough, and box, and how clever he was! Take him all round, who
      wouldn&rsquo;t rather have had him for a father than Achilles? And there were
      just as many women in love with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More,&rsquo; said Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; I continued, thanking him in my heart, for it must have cost
      him something to let Ulysses be set above Achilles, &lsquo;Telemachus is the one
      I mean. He was in search of his father. He found him at last. Upon my
      honour, Temple, when I think of it, I &lsquo;m ashamed to have waited so long. I
      call that luxury I&rsquo;ve lived in senseless. Yes! while I was uncertain
      whether my father had enough to eat or not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say! hush!&rsquo; Temple breathed, in pain at such allusions. &lsquo;Richie, the
      squire has finished his bottle by about now; bottle number two. He won&rsquo;t
      miss us till the morning, but Miss Beltham will. She&rsquo;ll be at your bedroom
      door three or four times in the night, I know. It&rsquo;s getting darker and
      darker, we must be in some dreadful part of London.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The contrast he presented to my sensations between our pleasant home and
      this foggy solitude gave me a pang of dismay. I diverged from my favourite
      straight line, which seemed to pierce into the bowels of the earth, sharp
      to the right. Soon or late after, I cannot tell, we were in the midst of a
      thin stream of people, mostly composed of boys and young women, going at
      double time, hooting and screaming with the delight of loosened animals,
      not quite so agreeably; but animals never hunted on a better scent. A
      dozen turnings in their company brought us in front of a fire. There we
      saw two houses preyed on by the flames, just as if a lion had his paws on
      a couple of human creatures, devouring them; we heard his jaws, the
      cracking of bones, shrieks, and the voracious in-and-out of his breath
      edged with anger. A girl by my side exclaimed, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not the Bench, after
      all! Would I have run to see a paltry two-story washerwoman&rsquo;s
      mangling-shed flare up, when six penn&rsquo;orth of squibs and shavings and a
      cracker make twice the fun!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned to her, hardly able to speak. &lsquo;Where &lsquo;s the Bench, if you
      please?&rsquo; She pointed. I looked on an immense high wall. The blunt flames
      of the fire opposite threw a sombre glow on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl said, &lsquo;And don&rsquo;t you go hopping into debt, my young cock-sparrow,
      or you&rsquo;ll know one side o&rsquo; the turnkey better than t&rsquo; other.&rsquo; She had a
      friend with her who chid her for speaking so freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it too late to go in to-night?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered that it was, and that she and her friend were the persons to
      show me the way in there. Her friend answered more sensibly: &lsquo;Yes, you
      can&rsquo;t go in there before some time&mdash;in the morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I learnt from her that the Bench was a debtors&rsquo; prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      The saucy girl of the pair asked me for money. I handed her a crown-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now won&rsquo;t you give another big bit to my friend?&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no change, and the well-mannered girl bade me never mind, the saucy
      one pressed for it, and for a treat. She was amusing in her talk of the
      quantity of different fires she had seen; she had also seen
      accidental-death corpses, but never a suicide in the act; and here she
      regretted the failure of her experiences. This conversation of a
      good-looking girl amazed me. Presently Temple cried, &lsquo;A third house
      caught, and no engines yet! Richie, there&rsquo;s an old woman in her
      night-dress; we can&rsquo;t stand by.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The saucy girl joked at the poor half-naked old woman. Temple stood
      humping and agitating his shoulders like a cat before it springs. Both the
      girls tried to stop us. The one I liked best seized my watch, and said,
      &lsquo;Leave this to me to take care of,&rsquo; and I had no time to wrestle for it. I
      had a glimpse of her face that let me think she was not fooling me, the
      watch-chain flew off my neck, Temple and I clove through the crowd of
      gapers. We got into the heat, which was in a minute scorching. Three men
      were under the window; they had sung out to the old woman above to drop a
      blanket&mdash;she tossed them a water-jug. She was saved by the blanket of
      a neighbour. Temple and I strained at one corner of it to catch her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came down, the men said, like a singed turkey. The flames illuminated
      her as she descended. There was a great deal of laughter in the crowd, but
      I was shocked. Temple shared the painful impression produced on me. I
      cannot express my relief when the old woman was wrapped in the blanket
      which had broken her descent, and stood like a blot instead of a figure. I
      handed a sovereign to the three men, complimenting them on the humanity of
      their dispositions. They cheered us, and the crowd echoed the cheer, and
      Temple and I made our way back to the two girls: both of us lost our
      pocket-handkerchiefs, and Temple a penknife as well. Then the engines
      arrived and soused the burning houses. We were all in a crimson mist, boys
      smoking, girls laughing and staring, men hallooing, hats and caps flying
      about, fights going on, people throwing their furniture out of the
      windows. The great wall of the Bench was awful in its reflection of the
      labouring flames&mdash;it rose out of sight like the flame-tops till the
      columns of water brought them down. I thought of my father, and of my
      watch. The two girls were not visible. &lsquo;A glorious life a fireman&rsquo;s!&rsquo; said
      Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The firemen were on the roofs of the houses, handsome as Greek heroes, and
      it really did look as if they were engaged in slaying an enormous dragon,
      that hissed and tongued at them, and writhed its tail, paddling its broken
      big red wings in the pit of wreck and smoke, twisting and
      darkening-something fine to conquer, I felt with Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mutual disgust at the inconvenience created by the appropriation of our
      pocket-handkerchiefs by members of the crowd, induced us to disentangle
      ourselves from it without confiding to any one our perplexity for supper
      and a bed. We were now extremely thirsty. I had visions of my majority
      bottles of Burgundy, lying under John Thresher&rsquo;s care at Dipwell, and
      would have abandoned them all for one on the spot. After ranging about the
      outskirts of the crowd, seeking the two girls, we walked away, not so
      melancholy but that a draught of porter would have cheered us. Temple
      punned on the loss of my watch, and excused himself for a joke neither of
      us had spirit to laugh at. Just as I was saying, with a last glance at the
      fire, &lsquo;Anyhow, it would have gone in that crowd,&rsquo; the nice good girl ran
      up behind us, crying, &lsquo;There!&rsquo; as she put the watch-chain over my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, Temple,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;didn&rsquo;t I tell you so?&rsquo; and Temple kindly
      supposed so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl said, &lsquo;I was afraid I&rsquo;d missed you, little fellow, and you&rsquo;d take
      me for a thief, and thank God, I&rsquo;m no thief yet. I rushed into the crowd
      to meet you after you caught that old creature, and I could have kissed
      you both, you&rsquo;re so brave.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We always go in for it together,&rsquo; said Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made an offer to the girl of a piece of gold. &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m poor,&rsquo; she cried,
      yet kept her hand off it like a bird alighting on ground, not on prey.
      When I compelled her to feel the money tight, she sighed, &lsquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t so
      poor! I don&rsquo;t want your gold. Why are you out so late?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We informed her of our arrival from the country, and wanderings in the
      fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you&rsquo;ll say you&rsquo;re not tired, I know,&rsquo; the girl remarked, and laughed
      to hear how correctly she had judged of our temper. Our thirst and hunger,
      however, filled her with concern, because of our not being used to it as
      she was, and no place was open to supply our wants. Her friend, the saucy
      one, accompanied by a man evidently a sailor, joined us, and the three had
      a consultation away from Temple and me, at the end of which the sailor,
      whose name was Joe, raised his leg dancingly, and smacked it. We gave him
      our hands to shake, and understood, without astonishment, that we were
      invited on, board his ship to partake of refreshment. We should not have
      been astonished had he said on board his balloon. Down through thick fog
      of a lighter colour, we made our way to a narrow lane leading to the
      river-side, where two men stood thumping their arms across their breasts,
      smoking pipes, and swearing. We entered a boat and were rowed to a ship. I
      was not aware how frozen and befogged my mind and senses had become until
      I had taken a desperate and long gulp of smoking rum-and-water, and then
      the whole of our adventures from morning to midnight, with the fir-trees
      in the country fog, and the lamps in the London fog, and the man who had
      lost his son, the fire, the Bench, the old woman with her fowl-like cry
      and limbs in the air, and the row over the misty river, swam flashing
      before my eyes, and I cried out to the two girls, who were drinking out of
      one glass with the sailor Joe, my entertainer, &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m awake now!&rsquo; and
      slept straight off the next instant.

      CHAPTER XII. WE FIND OURSELVES BOUND ON A VOYAGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It seemed to me that I had but taken a turn from right to left, or gone
      round a wheel, when I repeated the same words, and I heard Temple
      somewhere near me mumble something like them. He drew a long breath, so
      did I: we cleared our throats with a sort of whinny simultaneously. The
      enjoyment of lying perfectly still, refreshed, incurious, unexcited, yet
      having our minds animated, excursive, reaping all the incidents of our
      lives at leisure, and making a dream of our latest experiences, kept us
      tranquil and incommunicative. Occasionally we let fall a sigh fathoms
      deep, then by-and-by began blowing a bit of a wanton laugh at the end of
      it. I raised my foot and saw the boot on it, which accounted for an uneasy
      sensation setting in through my frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said softly, &lsquo;What a pleasure it must be for horses to be groomed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just what I was thinking!&rsquo; said Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      We started up on our elbows, and one or the other cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a chart! These are bunks! Hark at the row overhead! We&rsquo;re in a
      ship! The ship&rsquo;s moving! Is it foggy this morning? It&rsquo;s time to get up!
      I&rsquo;ve slept in my clothes! Oh, for a dip! How I smell of smoke! What a
      noise of a steamer! And the squire at Riversley! Fancy Uberly&rsquo;s tale!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple, with averted face, asked me whether I meant to return to Riversley
      that day. I assured him I would, on my honour, if possible; and of course
      he also would have to return there. &lsquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve an appointment with Janet
      Ilchester,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and we may find a pug; we&rsquo;ll buy the hunting-knife
      and the skates. And she shall know you saved an old woman&rsquo;s life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t talk about that,&rsquo; Temple entreated me, biting his lip. &lsquo;Richie,
      we&rsquo;re going fast through the water. It reminds me of breakfast. I should
      guess the hour to be nine A.M.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My watch was unable to assist us; the hands pointed to half-past four, and
      were fixed. We ran up on deck. Looking over the stern of the vessel,
      across a line of rippling eddying red gold, we saw the sun low upon
      cushions of beautiful cloud; no trace of fog anywhere; blue sky overhead,
      and a mild breeze blowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sunrise,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple answered, &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; most uncertainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      We looked round. A steam-tug was towing our ship out toward banks of
      red-reflecting cloud, and a smell of sea air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, that&rsquo;s the East there!&rsquo; cried Temple. We faced about to the sun, and
      behold, he was actually sinking!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; we exclaimed in a breath. From seaward to this stupefying
      sunset we stood staring. The river stretched to broad lengths; gulls were
      on the grey water, knots of seaweed, and the sea-foam curled in advance of
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By jingo!&rsquo; Temple spoke out, musing, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s a whole day struck out of
      our existence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It can&rsquo;t be!&rsquo; said I, for that any sensible being could be tricked of a
      piece of his life in that manner I thought a preposterous notion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sight of a lessening windmill in the West, shadows eastward, the
      wide water, and the air now full salt, convinced me we two had slept
      through an entire day, and were passing rapidly out of hail of our native
      land.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must get these fellows to put us on shore at once,&rsquo; said Temple: &lsquo;we
      won&rsquo;t stop to eat. There&rsquo;s a town; a boat will row us there in
      half-an-hour. Then we can wash, too. I&rsquo;ve got an idea nothing&rsquo;s clean
      here. And confound these fellows for not having the civility to tell us
      they were going to start!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We were rather angry, a little amused, not in the least alarmed at our
      position. A sailor, to whom we applied for an introduction to the captain,
      said he was busy. Another gave us a similar reply, with a monstrous
      grimace which was beyond our comprehension. The sailor Joe was nowhere to
      be seen. None of the sailors appeared willing to listen to us, though they
      stopped as they were running by to lend half an ear to what we had to say.
      Some particular movement was going on in the ship. Temple was the first to
      observe that the steamtug was casting us loose, and cried he, &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll take
      us on board and back to London Bridge. Let&rsquo;s hail her.&rsquo; He sang out,
      &lsquo;Whoop! ahoy!&rsquo; I meanwhile had caught sight of Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, young gentleman!&rsquo; he accosted me, and he hoped I had slept well. My
      courteous request to him to bid the tug stand by to take us on board, only
      caused him to wear a look of awful gravity. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re such a deuce of a
      sleeper,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You see, we had to be off early to make up for forty
      hours lost by that there fog. I tried to wake you both; no good; so I let
      you snore away. We took up our captain mid-way down the river, and now
      you&rsquo;re in his hands, and he&rsquo;ll do what he likes with you, and that &lsquo;s a
      fact, and my opinion is you &lsquo;ll see a foreign shore before you&rsquo;re in the
      arms of your family again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words I had the horrible sensation of being caged, and worse,
      transported into the bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I insisted on seeing the captain. A big bright round moon was dancing over
      the vessel&rsquo;s bowsprit, and this, together with the tug thumping into the
      distance, and the land receding, gave me&mdash;coming on my wrath&mdash;suffocating
      emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      No difficulties were presented in my way. I was led up to a broad man in a
      pilot-coat, who stood square, and looked by the bend of his eyebrows as if
      he were always making head against a gale. He nodded to my respectful
      salute. &lsquo;Cabin,&rsquo; he said, and turned his back to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I addressed him, &lsquo;Excuse me, I want to go on shore, captain. I must and
      will go! I am here by some accident; you have accidentally overlooked me
      here. I wish to treat you like a gentleman, but I won&rsquo;t be detained.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe spoke a word to the captain, who kept his back as broad to me as a
      school-slate for geography and Euclid&rsquo;s propositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cabin, cabin,&rsquo; the captain repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to get round him to dash a furious sentence or so in his face,
      since there was no producing any impression on his back; but he occupied
      the whole of a way blocked with wire-coil, and rope, and boxes, and it
      would have been ridiculous to climb this barricade when by another
      right-about-face he could in a minute leave me volleying at the blank
      space between his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe touched my arm, which, in as friendly a way as I could assume, I bade
      him not do a second time; for I could ill contain myself as it was, and
      beginning to think I had been duped and tricked, I was ready for
      hostilities. I could hardly bear meeting Temple on my passage to the
      cabin. &lsquo;Captain Jasper Welsh,&rsquo; he was reiterating, as if sounding it to
      discover whether it had an ominous ring: it was the captain&rsquo;s name, that
      he had learnt from one of the seamen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irritated by his repetition of it, I said, I know not why, or how the
      words came: &lsquo;A highwayman notorious for his depredations in the vicinity
      of the city of Bristol.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This set Temple off laughing: &lsquo;And so he bought a ship and had traps laid
      down to catch young fellows for ransom.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was obliged to request Temple not to joke, but the next moment I had
      launched Captain Jasper Welsh on a piratical exploit; Temple lifted the
      veil from his history, revealing him amid the excesses of a cannibal
      feast. I dragged him before a British jury; Temple hanged him in view of
      an excited multitude. As he boasted that there was the end of Captain
      Welsh, I broke the rope. But Temple spoiled my triumph by depriving him of
      the use of his lower limbs after the fall, for he was a heavy man. I could
      not contradict it, and therefore pitched all his ship&rsquo;s crew upon the
      gallows in a rescue. Temple allowed him to be carried off by his faithful
      ruffians, only stipulating that the captain was never after able to
      release his neck from the hangman&rsquo;s slip knot. The consequence was that he
      wore a shirt-collar up to his eyebrows for concealment by day, and a
      pillow-case over his head at night, and his wife said she was a deceived
      unhappy woman, and died of curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talking of even such nonsense as this was a relief to us in our
      impatience and helplessness, with the lights of land heaving far distant
      to our fretful sight through the cabin windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had to talk reasonably we were not so successful. Captain Welsh
      was one of those men who show you, whether you care to see them or not,
      all the processes by which they arrive at an idea of you, upon which they
      forthwith shape their course. Thus, when he came to us in the cabin, he
      took the oil-lamp in his hand and examined our faces by its light; he had
      no reply to our remonstrances and petitions: all he said was, &lsquo;Humph!
      well, I suppose you&rsquo;re both gentlemen born&rsquo;; and he insisted on
      prosecuting his scrutiny without any reference to the tenour of our
      observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      We entreated him half imperiously to bring his ship to and put us on shore
      in a boat. He bunched up his mouth, remarking, &lsquo;Know their grammar: habit
      o&rsquo; speaking to grooms, eh? humph.&rsquo; We offered to pay largely. &lsquo;Loose o&rsquo; 
      their cash,&rsquo; was his comment, and so on; and he was the more exasperating
      to us because he did not look an evil-minded man; only he appeared to be
      cursed with an evil opinion of us. I tried to remove it; I spoke
      forbearingly. Temple, imitating me, was sugar-sweet. We exonerated the
      captain from blame, excused him for his error, named the case a mistake on
      both sides. That long sleep of ours, we said, was really something
      laughable; we laughed at the recollection of it, a lamentable piece of
      merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our artfulness and patience becoming exhausted, for the captain had
      vouchsafed us no direct answer, I said at last, &lsquo;Captain Welsh, here we
      are on board your ship will you tell us what you mean to do with us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He now said bluntly, &lsquo;I will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll behave like a man of honour,&rsquo; said I, and to that he cried
      vehemently, &lsquo;I will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;call out the boat, if you please; we&rsquo;re anxious to
      be home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you shall!&rsquo; the captain shouted, &lsquo;and per ship&mdash;my barque
      Priscilla; and better men than you left, or I &lsquo;m no Christian.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple said briskly, &lsquo;Thank you, captain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may wait awhile with that, my lad,&rsquo; he answered; and, to our
      astonishment, recommended us to go and clean our faces and prepare to
      drink some tea at his table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you very much, captain, we&rsquo;ll do that when we &lsquo;re on shore,&rsquo; said
      we.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have black figure-heads and empty gizzards, then, by that time,&rsquo; 
      he remarked. We beheld him turning over the leaves of a Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, this sight of the Bible gave me a sense of personal security, and a
      notion of hypocrisy in his conduct as well; and perceiving that we had
      conjectured falsely as to his meaning to cast us on shore per ship, his
      barque Priscilla, I burst out in great heat, &lsquo;What! we are prisoners? You
      dare to detain us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple chimed in, in a similar strain. Fairly enraged, we flung at him
      without anything of what I thought eloquence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain ruminated up and down the columns of his Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was stung to feel that we were like two small terriers baiting a huge
      mild bull. At last he said, &lsquo;The story of the Prodigal Son.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; groaned Temple, at the mention of this worn-out old fellow, who has
      gone in harness to tracts ever since he ate the fatted calf.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the captain never heeded his interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Young gentlemen, I&rsquo;ve finished it while you &lsquo;ve been barking at me. If I
      &lsquo;d had him early in life on board my vessel, I hope I&rsquo;m not presumptuous
      in saying&mdash;the Lord forgive me if I be so!&mdash;I&rsquo;d have stopped his
      downward career&mdash;ay, so!&mdash;with a trip in the right direction.
      The Lord, young gentlemen, has not thrown you into my hands for no purpose
      whatsoever. Thank him on your knees to-night, and thank Joseph Double, my
      mate, when you rise, for he was the instrument of saving you from bad
      company. If this was a vessel where you &lsquo;d hear an oath or smell the smell
      of liquor, I &lsquo;d have let you run when there was terra firma within stone&rsquo;s
      throw. I came on board, I found you both asleep, with those marks of
      dissipation round your eyes, and I swore&mdash;in the Lord&rsquo;s name, mind
      you&mdash;I&rsquo;d help pluck you out of the pit while you had none but one leg
      in. It&rsquo;s said! It&rsquo;s no use barking. I am not to be roused. The devil in me
      is chained by the waist, and a twenty-pound weight on his tongue. With
      your assistance I&rsquo;ll do the same for the devil in you. Since you&rsquo;ve had
      plenty of sleep, I &lsquo;ll trouble you to commit to memory the whole story of
      the Prodigal Son &lsquo;twixt now and morrow&rsquo;s sunrise. We &lsquo;ll have our
      commentary on it after labour done. Labour you will in my vessel, for your
      soul&rsquo;s health. And let me advise you not to talk; in your situation
      talking&rsquo;s temptation to lying. You&rsquo;ll do me the obligation to feed at my
      table. And when I hand you back to your parents, why, they&rsquo;ll thank me, if
      you won&rsquo;t. But it&rsquo;s not thanks I look for: it&rsquo;s my bounden Christian duty
      I look to. I reckon a couple o&rsquo; stray lambs equal to one lost sheep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain uplifted his arm, ejaculating solemnly, &lsquo;By!&rsquo; and faltered.
      &lsquo;You were going to swear!&rsquo; said Temple, with savage disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the blessing of Omnipotence! I&rsquo;ll save a pair o&rsquo; pups from turning
      wolves. And I&rsquo;m a weak mortal man, that &lsquo;s too true.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was going to swear,&rsquo; Temple muttered to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I considered the detection of Captain Welsh&rsquo;s hypocrisy unnecessary,
      almost a condescension toward familiarity; but the ire in my bosom was
      boiling so that I found it impossible to roll out the flood of eloquence
      with which I was big. Soon after, I was trying to bribe the man with all
      my money and my watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who gave you that watch?&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Downright Church catechism!&rsquo; muttered Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My grandfather,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain&rsquo;s head went like a mechanical hammer, to express something
      indescribable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My grandfather,&rsquo; I continued, &lsquo;will pay you handsomely for any service
      you do to me and my friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, that&rsquo;s not far off forgoing,&rsquo; said the captain, in a tone as much as
      to say we were bad all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw the waters slide by his cabin-windows. My desolation, my
      humiliation, my chained fury, tumbled together. Out it came&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Captain, do behave to us like a gentleman, and you shall never repent it.
      Our relatives will be miserable about us. They&mdash;captain!&mdash;they
      don&rsquo;t know where we are. We haven&rsquo;t even a change of clothes. Of course we
      know we&rsquo;re at your mercy, but do behave like an honest man. You shall be
      paid or not, just as you please, for putting us on shore, but we shall be
      eternally grateful to you. Of course you mean kindly to us; we see that&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thank the Lord for it!&rsquo; he interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only you really are under a delusion. It &lsquo;s extraordinary. You can&rsquo;t be
      quite in your right senses about us; you must be&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean to
      speak disrespectfully-what we call on shore, cracked about us....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Doddered, don&rsquo;t they say in one of the shires?&rsquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-encouraged, and in the belief that I might be getting eloquent, I
      appealed to his manliness. Why should he take advantage of a couple of
      boys? I struck the key of his possible fatherly feelings: What misery were
      not our friends suffering now. (&lsquo;Ay, a bucketful now saves an ocean in
      time to come!&rsquo; he flung in his word.) I bade him, with more pathetic
      dignity reflect on the dreadful hiatus in our studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that Latin or Greek?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would not reply to the cold-blooded question. He said the New Testament
      was written in Greek, he knew, and happy were those who could read it in
      the original.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and how can we be learning to read it on board ship?&rsquo; said Temple,
      an observation that exasperated me because it seemed more to the point
      than my lengthy speech, and betrayed that he thought so; however, I took
      it up:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can we be graduating for our sphere in life, Captain Welsh, on board
      your vessel? Tell us that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He played thumb and knuckles on his table. Just when I was hoping that
      good would come of the senseless tune, Temple cried,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell us what your exact intentions are, Captain Welsh. What do you mean
      to do with us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mean to take you the voyage out and the voyage home, Providence willing,&rsquo; 
      said the captain, and he rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      We declined his offer of tea, though I fancy we could have gnawed at a
      bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no compulsion in that matter,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You share my cabin while
      you&rsquo;re my guests, shipmates, and apprentices in the path of living; my
      cabin and my substance, the same as if you were what the North-countrymen
      call bairns o&rsquo; mine: I&rsquo;ve none o&rsquo; my own. My wife was a barren woman. I&rsquo;ve
      none but my old mother at home. Have your sulks out, lads; you&rsquo;ll come
      round like the Priscilla on a tack, and discover you&rsquo;ve made way by it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We quitted his cabin, bowing stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple declared old Rippenger was better than this canting rascal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sea was around us, a distant yellow twinkle telling of land.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His wife a barren woman! what&rsquo;s that to us!&rsquo; Temple went on, exploding at
      intervals. &lsquo;So was Sarah. His cabin and his substance! He talks more like
      a preacher than a sailor. I should like to see him in a storm! He&rsquo;s no
      sailor at all. His men hate him. It wouldn&rsquo;t be difficult to get up a
      mutiny on board this ship. Richie, I understand the whole plot: he&rsquo;s in
      want of cabin-boys. The fellow has impressed us. We shall have to serve
      till we touch land. Thank God, there&rsquo;s a British consul everywhere; I say
      that seriously. I love my country; may she always be powerful! My life is
      always at her&mdash;Did you feel that pitch of the ship? Of all the names
      ever given to a vessel, I do think Priscilla is without exception the most
      utterly detestable. Oh! there again. No, it&rsquo;ll be too bad, Richie, if we
      &lsquo;re beaten in this way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If YOU are beaten,&rsquo; said I, scarcely venturing to speak lest I should cry
      or be sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      We both felt that the vessel was conspiring to ruin our self-respect. I
      set my head to think as hard as possible on Latin verses (my instinct must
      have drawn me to them as to a species of intellectual biscuit steeped in
      spirit, tough, and comforting, and fundamentally opposed to existing
      circumstances, otherwise I cannot account for the attraction). They helped
      me for a time; they kept off self-pity, and kept the machinery of the mind
      at work. They lifted me, as it were, to an upper floor removed from the
      treacherously sighing Priscilla. But I came down quickly with a crash; no
      dexterous management of my mental resources could save me from the
      hemp-like smell of the ship, nor would leaning over the taffrail, nor
      lying curled under a tarpaulin. The sailors heaped pilot-coats upon us. It
      was a bad ship, they said, to be sick on board of, for no such thing as
      brandy was allowed in the old Priscilla. Still I am sure I tasted some
      before I fell into a state of semi-insensibility. As in a trance I heard
      Temple&rsquo;s moans, and the captain&rsquo;s voice across the gusty wind, and the
      forlorn crunching of the ship down great waves. The captain&rsquo;s figure was
      sometimes stooping over us, more great-coats were piled on us; sometimes
      the wind whistled thinner than one fancies the shrieks of creatures dead
      of starvation and restless, that spend their souls in a shriek as long as
      they can hold it on, say nursery-maids; the ship made a truce with the
      waters and grunted; we took two or three playful blows, we were drenched
      with spray, uphill we laboured, we caught the moon in a net of rigging,
      away we plunged; we mounted to plunge again and again. I reproached the
      vessel in argument for some imaginary inconsistency. Memory was like a
      heavy barrel on my breast, rolling with the sea.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. WE CONDUCT SEVERAL LEARNED ARGUMENTS WITH THE CAPTAIN OF THE
      PRISCILLA
    </h2>
    <p>
      Captain Welsh soon conquered us. The latest meal we had eaten was on the
      frosty common under the fir-trees. After a tremendous fast, with
      sea-sickness supervening, the eggs and bacon, and pleasant
      benevolent-smelling tea on the captain&rsquo;s table were things not to be
      resisted by two healthy boys who had previously stripped and faced buckets
      of maddening ice-cold salt-water, dashed at us by a jolly sailor. An open
      mind for new impressions came with the warmth of our clothes. We ate,
      bearing within us the souls of injured innocents; nevertheless, we were
      thankful, and, to the captain&rsquo;s grace, a long one, we bowed heads
      decently. It was a glorious breakfast, for which land and sea had prepared
      us in about equal degrees: I confess, my feelings when I jumped out of the
      cabin were almost those of one born afresh to life and understanding.
      Temple and I took counsel. We agreed that sulking would be ridiculous,
      unmanly, ungentlemanly. The captain had us fast, as if we were under a
      lion&rsquo;s paw; he was evidently a well-meaning man, a fanatic deluded
      concerning our characters: the barque Priscilla was bound for a German
      port, and should arrive there in a few days,&mdash;why not run the voyage
      merrily since we were treated with kindness? Neither the squire nor
      Temple&rsquo;s father could complain of our conduct; we were simply victims of
      an error that was assisting us to a knowledge of the world, a youth&rsquo;s
      proper ambition. &lsquo;And we&rsquo;re not going to be starved,&rsquo; said Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      I smiled, thinking I perceived the reason why I had failed in my oration
      over-night; so I determined that on no future occasion would I let pride
      stand in the way of provender. Breakfast had completely transformed us We
      held it due to ourselves that we should demand explanations from Joseph
      Double, the mate, and then, after hearing him, furnish them with a cordial
      alacrity to which we might have attached unlimited credence had he not
      protested against our dreaming him to have supplied hot rum-and-water on
      board, we wrote our names and addresses in the captain&rsquo;s log-book, and
      immediately asked permission to go to the mast-head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. Out of his cabin there was no smack of the preacher in him.
      His men said he was a stout seaman, mad on the subject of grog and girls.
      Why, it was on account of grog and girls that he was giving us this dish
      of salt-water to purify us! Grog and girls! cried we. We vowed upon our
      honour as gentlemen we had tasted grog for the first time in our lives on
      board the Priscilla. How about the girls? they asked. We informed them we
      knew none but girls who were ladies. Thereupon one sailor nodded, one sent
      up a crow, one said the misfortune of the case lay in all girls being such
      precious fine ladies; and one spoke in dreadfully blank language, he
      accused us of treating the Priscilla as a tavern for the entertainment of
      bad company, stating that he had helped to row me and my associates from
      the shore to the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor Mr. Double!&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;there was only one way for him to jump you
      two young gentlemen out o&rsquo; that snapdragon bowl you was in&mdash;or
      quashmire, call it; so he &lsquo;ticed you on board wi&rsquo; the bait you was
      swallowing, which was making the devil serve the Lord&rsquo;s turn. And I&rsquo;ll
      remember that night, for I yielded to swearing, and drank too!&rsquo; The other
      sailors roared with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tipped them, not to appear offended by their suspicions. We thought them
      all hypocrites, and were as much in error as if we had thought them all
      honest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things went fairly well with the exception of the lessons in Scripture.
      Our work was mere playing at sailoring, helping furl sails, haul ropes,
      study charts, carry messages, and such like. Temple made his voice
      shrewdly emphatic to explain to the captain that we liked the work, but
      that such lessons as these out of Scripture were what the eeriest
      youngsters were crammed with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Such lessons as these, maybe, don&rsquo;t have the meaning on land they get to
      have on the high seas,&rsquo; replied the captain: &lsquo;and those youngsters you
      talk of were not called in to throw a light on passages: for I may teach
      you ship&rsquo;s business aboard my barque, but we&rsquo;re all children inside the
      Book.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He groaned heartily to hear that our learning lay in the direction of
      Pagan Gods and Goddesses, and heathen historians and poets; adding, it was
      not new to him, and perhaps that was why the world was as it was. Nor did
      he wonder, he said, at our running from studies of those filthy writings
      loose upon London; it was as natural as dunghill steam. Temple pretended
      he was forced by the captain&rsquo;s undue severity to defend Venus; he said, I
      thought rather wittily, &lsquo;Sailors ought to have a respect for her, for she
      was born in the middle of the sea, and she steered straight for land, so
      she must have had a pretty good idea of navigation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the captain answered none the less keenly, &lsquo;She had her idea of
      navigating, as the devil of mischief always has, in the direction where
      there&rsquo;s most to corrupt; and, my lad, she teaches the navigation that
      leads to the bottom beneath us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He might be right, still our mien was evil in reciting the lessons from
      Scripture; and though Captain Welsh had intelligence we could not draw
      into it the how and the why of the indignity we experienced. We had rather
      he had been a savage captain, to have braced our spirits to sturdy
      resistance, instead of a mild, good-humoured man of kind intentions, who
      lent us his linen to wear, fed us at his table, and taxed our most
      gentlemanly feelings to find excuses for him. Our way of revenging
      ourselves becomingly was to laud the heroes of antiquity, as if they had
      possession of our souls and touched the fountain of worship. Whenever
      Captain Welsh exclaimed, &lsquo;Well done,&rsquo; or the equivalent, &lsquo;That &lsquo;s an
      idea,&rsquo; we referred him to Plutarch for our great exemplar. It was
      Alcibiades gracefully consuming his black broth that won the captain&rsquo;s
      thanks for theological acuteness, or the young Telemachus suiting his
      temper to the dolphin&rsquo;s moods, since he must somehow get on shore on the
      dolphin&rsquo;s back. Captain Welsh could not perceive in Temple the personifier
      of Alcibiades, nor Telemachus in me; but he was aware of an obstinate
      obstruction behind our compliance. This he called the devil coiled like a
      snake in its winter sleep. He hurled texts at it openly, or slyly dropped
      a particularly heavy one, in the hope of surprising it with a death-blow.
      We beheld him poring over his Bible for texts that should be sovereign
      medicines for us, deadly for the devil within us. Consequently, we were on
      the defensive: bits of Cicero, bits of Seneca, soundly and nobly moral,
      did service on behalf of Paganism; we remembered them certainly almost as
      if an imp had brought them from afar. Nor had we any desire to be in
      opposition to the cause he supported. What we were opposed to was the
      dogmatic arrogance of a just but ignorant man, who had his one specific
      for everything, and saw mortal sickness in all other remedies or
      recreations. Temple said to him,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If the Archbishop of Canterbury were to tell me Greek and Latin authors
      are bad for me, I should listen to his remarks, because he &lsquo;s a scholar:
      he knows the languages and knows what they contain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Welsh replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If the Archbishop o&rsquo; Canterbury sailed the sea, and lived in Foul Alley,
      Waterside, when on shore, and so felt what it is to toss on top of the
      waves o&rsquo; perdition, he&rsquo;d understand the value of a big, clean,
      well-manned, well-provisioned ship, instead o&rsquo; your galliots wi&rsquo; gaudy
      sails, your barges that can&rsquo;t rise to a sea, your yachts that run to port
      like mother&rsquo;s pets at first pipe o&rsquo; the storm, your trim-built wherries.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you&rsquo;d have only one sort of vessel afloat!&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the
      difference of a man who&rsquo;s a scholar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d have,&rsquo; said the captain, &lsquo;every lad like you, my lad, trained in the
      big ship, and he wouldn&rsquo;t capsize, and be found betrayed by his light
      timbers as I found you. Serve your apprenticeship in the Lord&rsquo;s
      three-decker; then to command what you may.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, Captain Welsh,&rsquo; says Temple: &lsquo;you must grind at Latin and Greek
      when you &lsquo;re a chick, or you won&rsquo;t ever master the rudiments. Upon my
      honour, I declare it &lsquo;s the truth, you must. If you&rsquo;d like to try, and are
      of a mind for a go at Greek, we&rsquo;ll do our best to help you through the
      aorists. It looks harder than Latin, but after a start it &lsquo;s easier. Only,
      I&rsquo;m afraid your three-decker&rsquo;s apprenticeship &lsquo;ll stand in your way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Greek &lsquo;s to be done for me; I can pay clever gentlemen for doing Greek
      for me,&rsquo; said the captain. &lsquo;The knowledge and the love of virtue I must do
      for myself; and not to be wrecked, I must do it early.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s neither learning nor human nature,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the knowledge o&rsquo; the right rules for human nature, my lad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you kidnap youngsters to serve in your ship, captain?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d bless the wind that blew them there, foul or not, my lad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And there they&rsquo;d stick when you had them, captain?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d think it was the Lord&rsquo;s will they should stick there awhile, my lad&mdash;yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what of their parents?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Youngsters out like gossamers on a wind, their parents are where they sow
      themselves, my lad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I call that hard on the real parents, Captain Welsh,&rsquo; said Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s harder on Providence when parents breed that kind o&rsquo; light creature,
      my lad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We were all getting excited, talking our best, such as it was; the captain
      leaning over his side of the table, clasping his hands unintentionally
      preacher-like; we on our side supporting our chins on our fists, quick to
      be at him. Temple was brilliant; he wanted to convert the captain, and
      avowed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re not like one of those tract-fellows. You&rsquo;re a man
      we can respect, a good seaman, master of your ship, and hearty, and no
      mewing sanctimoniousness, and we can see and excuse your mistake as to us
      two; but now, there&rsquo;s my father at home&mdash;he&rsquo;s a good man, but he &lsquo;s a
      man of the world, and reads his classics and his Bible. He&rsquo;s none the
      worse for it, I assure you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where was his son the night of the fog?&rsquo; said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, he happened to be out in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;d he be now but for one o&rsquo; my men?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who can answer that, Captain Welsh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can, my lad-stewing in an ante-room of hell-gates, I verily believe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple sighed at the captain&rsquo;s infatuation, and said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you of a
      fellow at our school named Drew; he was old Rippenger&rsquo;s best theological
      scholar&mdash;always got the prize for theology. Well, he was a confirmed
      sneak. I&rsquo;ve taken him into a corner and described the torments of dying to
      him, and his look was disgusting&mdash;he broke out in a clammy sweat.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he&rsquo;d cry. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just the fellow to suffer intensely,&rdquo; I
      told him. And what was his idea of escaping it? Why, by learning the whole
      of Deuteronomy and the Acts of the Apostles by heart! His idea of
      Judgement Day was old Rippenger&rsquo;s half-yearly examination. These are
      facts, you know, Captain Welsh.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I testified to them briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain said a curious thing: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make an appointment with you in
      leviathan&rsquo;s jaws the night of a storm, my lad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With pleasure,&rsquo; said Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Lord send it!&rsquo; exclaimed the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      His head was bent forward, and he was gazing up into his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we knew that anything was coming, he was out on a narrative of a
      scholar of one of the Universities. Our ears were indifferent to the young
      man&rsquo;s career from the heights of fortune to delirium tremens down the
      cataract of brandy, until the captain spoke of a dark night on the Pool of
      the Thames; and here his voice struggled, and we tried hard to catch the
      thread of the tale. Two men and a girl were in the boat. The men fought,
      the girl shrieked, the boat was upset, the three were drowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this came so suddenly that nothing but the captain&rsquo;s heavy thump of
      his fist on the table kept us from laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite unable to relate the tale, and we had to gather it from his
      exclamations. One of the men was mate of a vessel lying in the Pool,
      having only cast anchor that evening; the girl was his sweetheart; the
      other man had once been a fine young University gentleman, and had become
      an outfitter&rsquo;s drunken agent. The brave sailor had nourished him often
      when on shore, and he, with the fluent tongue which his college had
      trimmed for him, had led the girl to sin during her lover&rsquo;s absence.
      Howsoever, they put off together to welcome him on his arrival, never
      suspecting that their secret had been whispered to Robert Welsh
      beforehand. Howsoever, Robert gave them hearty greeting, and down to the
      cabin they went, and there sat drinking up to midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Three lost souls!&rsquo; said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See how they run,&rsquo; Temple sang, half audibly, and flushed hot, ashamed of
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&lsquo;Twas I had to bear the news to his mother,&rsquo; the captain pursued; &lsquo;and it
      was a task, my lads, for I was then little more than your age, and the
      glass was Robert&rsquo;s only fault, and he was my only brother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I offered my hand to the captain. He grasped it powerfully. &lsquo;That crew in
      a boat, and wouldn&rsquo;t you know the devil&rsquo;d be coxswain?&rsquo; he called loudly,
      and buried his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said, looking up at us, &lsquo;I pray for no storm, but, by the Lord&rsquo;s
      mercy, for a way to your hearts through fire or water. And now on deck, my
      lads, while your beds are made up. Three blind things we verily are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Welsh showed he was sharp of hearing. His allusion to the humming
      of the tune of the mice gave Temple a fit of remorse, and he apologized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said the captain, &lsquo;it is so; own it: frivolity&rsquo;s the fruit of that
      training that&rsquo;s all for the flesh. But dip you into some o&rsquo; my books on my
      shelves here, and learn to see living man half skeleton, like life and
      shadow, and never to living man need you pray forgiveness, my lad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      By sheer force of character he gained the command of our respect. Though
      we agreed on deck that he had bungled his story, it impressed us; we felt
      less able to cope with him, and less willing to encounter a storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall have one, of course,&rsquo; Temple said, affecting resignation, with a
      glance aloft.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was superstitiously of the same opinion, and praised the vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Priscilla&rsquo;s the very name of a ship that founders with all hands and
      sends a bottle on shore,&rsquo; said Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There isn&rsquo;t a bottle on board,&rsquo; said I; and this piece of nonsense helped
      us to sleep off our gloom.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. I MEET OLD FRIENDS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the prognostications it pleased us to indulge, we had a
      tolerably smooth voyage. On a clear cold Sunday morning we were sailing
      between a foreign river&rsquo;s banks, and Temple and I were alternately reading
      a chapter out of the Bible to the assembled ship&rsquo;s crew, in advance of the
      captain&rsquo;s short exhortation. We had ceased to look at ourselves inwardly,
      and we hardly thought it strange. But our hearts beat for a view of the
      great merchant city, which was called a free city, and therefore, Temple
      suggested, must bear certain portions of resemblance to old England; so we
      made up our minds to like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A wonderful place for beer cellars,&rsquo; a sailor observed to us slyly, and
      hitched himself up from the breech to the scalp.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all events, it was a place where we could buy linen.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that purpose, Captain Welsh handed us over to the care of his trusted
      mate Mr. Joseph Double, and we were soon in the streets of the city,
      desirous of purchasing half their contents. My supply of money was not
      enough for what I deemed necessary purchases. Temple had split his
      clothes, mine were tarred; we were appearing at a disadvantage, and we
      intended to dine at a good hotel and subsequently go to a theatre. Yet I
      had no wish to part with my watch. Mr. Double said it might be arranged.
      It was pawned at a shop for a sum equivalent in our money to about twelve
      pounds, and Temple obliged me by taking charge of the ticket. Thus we were
      enabled to dress suitably and dine pleasantly, and, as Mr. Double
      remarked, no one could rob me of my gold watch now. We visited a couple of
      beer-cellars to taste the drink of the people, and discovered three of our
      men engaged in a similar undertaking. I proposed that it should be done at
      my expense. They praised their captain, but asked us, as gentlemen and
      scholars, whether it was reasonable to object to liquor because your
      brother was carried out on a high tide? Mr. Double commended them to
      moderation. Their reply was to estimate an immoderate amount of liquor as
      due to them, with profound composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those rascals,&rsquo; Mr. Double informed us, &lsquo;are not in the captain&rsquo;s
      confidence they&rsquo;re tidy seamen, though, and they submit to the captain&rsquo;s
      laws on board and have their liberty ashore.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We inquired what the difference was between their privileges and his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;if they&rsquo;re so much as accused of a disobedient act, off
      they &lsquo;re scurried, and lose fair wages and a kind captain. And let any man
      Jack of &lsquo;em accuse me, and he bounds a india-rubber ball against a wall
      and gets it; all he meant to give he gets. Once you fix the confidence of
      your superior, you&rsquo;re waterproof.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We held our peace, but we could have spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Double had no moral hostility toward theatres. Supposing he did not
      relish the performance, he could enjoy a spell in the open air, he said,
      and this he speedily decided to do. Had we not been bound in honour to
      remain for him to fetch us, we also should have retired from a
      representation of which we understood only the word ja. It was tiresome to
      be perpetually waiting for the return of this word. We felt somewhat as
      dogs must feel when human speech is addressed to them. Accordingly, we
      professed, without concealment, to despise the whole performance. I
      reminded Temple of a saying of the Emperor Charles V. as to a knowledge of
      languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hem!&rsquo; he went critically; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s all very well for a German to talk in
      that way, but you can&rsquo;t be five times an Englishman if you&rsquo;re a
      foreigner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We heard English laughter near us. Presently an English gentleman accosted
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Villiers, I believe?&rsquo; He bowed at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My name is Richmond.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed again, with excuses, talked of the Play, and telegraphed to a
      lady sitting in a box fronting us. I saw that she wrote on a slip of
      paper; she beckoned; the gentleman quitted us, and soon after placed a
      twisted note in my hand. It ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Goodwin (whose Christian name is Clara) wishes very much to know how
      it has fared with Mr. Harry Richmond since he left Venice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I pushed past a number of discontented knees, trying, on my way to her
      box, to recollect her vividly, but I could barely recollect her at all,
      until I had sat beside her five minutes. Colonel Goodwin was asleep in a
      corner of the box. Awakened by the sound of his native tongue, he
      recognized me immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On your way to your father?&rsquo; he said, as he shook my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought it amazing he should guess that in Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know where he is, sir?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We saw him,&rsquo; replied the colonel; &lsquo;when was it, Clara? A week or ten days
      ago.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Miss Goodwin; &lsquo;we will talk of that by-and-by.&rsquo; And she
      overflowed with comments on my personal appearance, and plied me with
      questions, but would answer none of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fetched Temple into the box to introduce him. We were introduced in turn
      to Captain Malet, the gentleman who had accosted me below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You understand German, then?&rsquo; said Miss Goodwin.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared at hearing that we knew only the word ja, for it made our
      presence in Germany unaccountable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The most dangerous word of all,&rsquo; said Colonel Goodwin, and begged us
      always to repeat after it the negative nein for an antidote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have both seen my father?&rsquo; I whispered to Miss Goodwin; &lsquo;both? We
      have been separated. Do tell me everything. Don&rsquo;t look at the stage-they
      speak such nonsense. How did you remember me? How happy I am to have met
      you! Oh! I haven&rsquo;t forgotten the gondolas and the striped posts, and stali
      and the other word; but soon after we were separated, and I haven&rsquo;t seen
      him since.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She touched her father&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At once, if you like,&rsquo; said he, jumping up erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In Germany was it?&rsquo; I persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded gravely and leaned softly on my arm while we marched out of the
      theatre to her hotel&mdash;I in such a state of happiness underlying
      bewilderment and strong expectation that I should have cried out loud had
      not pride in my partner restrained me. At her tea-table I narrated the
      whole of my adventure backwards to the time of our parting in Venice,
      hurrying it over as quick as I could, with the breathless termination,
      &lsquo;And now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They had an incomprehensible reluctance to perform their part of the
      implied compact. Miss Goodwin looked at Captain Malet. He took his leave.
      Then she said, &lsquo;How glad I am you have dropped that odious name of Roy!
      Papa and I have talked of you frequently&mdash;latterly very often. I
      meant to write to you, Harry Richmond. I should have done it the moment we
      returned to England.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must know,&rsquo; said the colonel, &lsquo;that I am an amateur inspector of
      fortresses, and my poor Clara has to trudge the Continent with me to pick
      up the latest inventions in artillery and other matters, for which I get
      no thanks at head-quarters&mdash;but it &lsquo;s one way of serving one&rsquo;s
      country when the steel lies rusting. We are now for home by way of Paris.
      I hope that you and your friend will give us your company. I will see this
      Captain Welsh of yours before we start. Clara, you decided on dragging me
      to the theatre to-night with your usual admirable instinct.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I reminded Miss Goodwin of my father being in Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he is at one of the Courts, a long distance from here,&rsquo; she said,
      rapidly. &lsquo;And you came by accident in a merchant-ship! You are one of
      those who are marked for extraordinary adventures. Confess: you would have
      set eyes on me, and not known me. It&rsquo;s a miracle that I should meet my
      little friend Harry&mdash;little no longer my friend all the same, are you
      not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I hoped so ardently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She with great urgency added, &lsquo;Then come with us. Prove that you put faith
      in our friendship.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In desperation I exclaimed, &lsquo;But I must, I must hear of my father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to consult the colonel&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; he said, and eulogized a loving son. &lsquo;Clara will talk to you.
      I&rsquo;m for bed. What was the name of the play we saw this evening? Oh!
      Struensee, to be sure. We missed the scaffold.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He wished us good-night on an appointment of the hour for breakfast, and
      ordered beds for us in the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Goodwin commenced: &lsquo;But really I have nothing to tell you, or very
      little. You know, Papa has introductions everywhere; we are like
      Continental people, and speak a variety of languages, and I am almost a
      foreigner, we are so much abroad; but I do think English boys should be
      educated at home: I hope you&rsquo;ll go to an English college.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Noticing my painful look, &lsquo;We saw him at the Court of the Prince of
      Eppenwelzen,&rsquo; she said, as if her brows ached. &lsquo;He is very kindly treated
      there; he was there some weeks ago. The place lies out in the Hanover
      direction, far from here. He told us that you were with your grandfather,
      and I must see Riversley Grange, and the truth is you must take me there.
      I suspect you have your peace to make; perhaps I shall help you, and be a
      true Peribanou. We go over Amsterdam, the Hague, Brussels, and you shall
      see the battlefield, Paris, straight to London. Yes, you are fickle; you
      have not once called me Peribanou.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voluble rattling succeeded in fencing off my questions before I could
      exactly shape them, as I staggered from blind to blind idea, now thinking
      of the sombre red Bench, and now of the German prince&rsquo;s Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell me any more to-night?&rsquo; I said, when she paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, I have not any more to tell,&rsquo; she assured me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was clear to me that she had joined the mysterious league against my
      father. I began to have a choking in the throat. I thanked her and wished
      her good-night while I was still capable of smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      At my next interview with Colonel Goodwin he spoke promptly on the subject
      of my wanderings. I was of an age, he said, to know my own interests. No
      doubt filial affection was excellent in its way, but in fact it was highly
      questionable whether my father was still at the Court of this German
      prince; my father had stated that he meant to visit England to obtain an
      interview with his son, and I might miss him by a harum-scarum chase over
      Germany. And besides, was I not offending my grandfather and my aunt, to
      whom I owed so much? He appealed to my warmest feelings on their behalf.
      This was just the moment, he said, when there was a turning-point in my
      fortunes. He could assure me most earnestly that I should do no good by
      knocking at this prince&rsquo;s doors, and have nothing but bitterness if I did
      in the end discover my father. &lsquo;Surely you understand the advantages of
      being bred a gentleman?&rsquo; he wound up. &lsquo;Under your grandfather&rsquo;s care you
      have a career before you, a fine fortune in prospect, everything a young
      man can wish for. And I must tell you candidly, you run great risk of
      missing all these things by hunting your father to earth. Give yourself a
      little time: reflect on it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have,&rsquo; I cried. &lsquo;I have come out to find him, and I must.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel renewed his arguments and persuasions until he was worn out. I
      thanked him continually for his kindness. Clara Goodwin besought me in a
      surprising manner to accompany her to England, called herself Peribanou,
      and with that name conjured up my father to my eyes in his breathing form.
      She said, as her father had done, that I was called on now to decide upon
      my future: she had a presentiment that evil would come to me of my
      unchecked, headstrong will, which she dignified by terming it a true but
      reckless affection: she believed she had been thrown in my path to prove
      herself a serviceable friend, a Peribanou of twenty-six who would not
      expect me to marry her when she had earned my gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      They set Temple on me, and that was very funny. To hear him with his &lsquo;I
      say, Richie, come, perhaps it&rsquo;s as well to know where a thing should stop;
      your father knows you&rsquo;re at Riversley, and he&rsquo;ll be after you when
      convenient; and just fancy the squire!&rsquo; was laughable. He had some anxiety
      to be home again, or at least at Riversley. I offered him to Miss Goodwin.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reproached me and coaxed me; she was exceedingly sweet. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; she
      said, in an odd, resigned fashion, &lsquo;rest a day with us; will you refuse me
      that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I consented; she knew not with what fretfulness. We went out to gaze at
      the shops and edifices, and I bought two light bags for slinging over the
      shoulder, two nightshirts, toothbrushes, and pocket-combs, and a large map
      of Germany. By dint of vehement entreaties I led her to point to the
      territory of the Prince of Eppenwelzen-Sarkeld. &lsquo;His income is rather less
      than that of your grandfather, friend Harry,&rsquo; she remarked. I doated on
      the spot until I could have dropped my finger on it blindfold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three pitched battles brought us to a friendly arrangement. The
      colonel exacted my promise that if I saw my father at Sarkeld in
      Eppenwelzen I would not stay with him longer than seven days: and that if
      he was not there I would journey home forthwith. When I had yielded the
      promise frankly on my honour, he introduced me to a banker of the city,
      who agreed to furnish me money to carry me on to England in case I should
      require it. A diligence engaged to deliver me within a few miles of
      Sarkeld. I wrote a letter to my aunt Dorothy, telling her facts, and one
      to the squire, beginning, &lsquo;We were caught on our arrival in London by the
      thickest fog ever remembered,&rsquo; as if it had been settled on my departure
      from Riversley that Temple and I were bound for London. Miss Goodwin was
      my post-bag. She said when we had dined, about two hours before the
      starting of the diligence, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you ought to go and wish that
      captain of the vessel you sailed in goodbye?&rsquo; I fell into her plot so far
      as to walk down to the quays on the river-side and reconnoitre the ship.
      But there I saw my prison. I kissed my hand to Captain Welsh&rsquo;s mainmast
      rather ironically, though not without regard for him. Miss Goodwin lifted
      her eyelids at our reappearance. As she made no confession of her treason
      I did not accuse her, and perhaps it was owing to a movement of her
      conscience that at our parting she drew me to her near enough for a kiss
      to come of itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four-and-twenty German words of essential service to a traveller in
      Germany constituted our knowledge of the language, and these were on paper
      transcribed by Miss Goodwin&rsquo;s own hand. In the gloom of the diligence,
      packed between Germans of a size that not even Tacitus had prepared me
      for, smoked over from all sides, it was a fascinating study. Temple and I
      exchanged the paper half-hourly while the light lasted. When that had
      fled, nothing was left us to combat the sensation that we were in the
      depths of a manure-bed, for the windows were closed, the tobacco-smoke
      thickened, the hides of animals wrapping our immense companions reeked;
      fire occasionally glowed in their pipe-bowls; they were silent, and gave
      out smoke and heat incessantly, like inanimate forces of nature. I had
      most fantastic ideas,&mdash;that I had taken root and ripened, and must
      expect my head to drop off at any instant: that I was deep down, wedged in
      the solid mass of the earth. But I need not repeat them: they were
      accurately translated in imagination from my physical miseries. The dim
      revival of light, when I had well-nigh ceased to hope for it, showed us
      all like malefactors imperfectly hanged, or drowned wretches in a cabin
      under water. I had one Colossus bulging over my shoulder! Temple was
      blotted out. His face, emerging from beneath a block of curly bearskin,
      was like that of one frozen in wonderment. Outside there was a melting
      snow on the higher hills; the clouds over them grew steel-blue. We were
      going through a valley in a fir-forest.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. WE ARE ACCOSTED BY A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE LADY IN THE FOREST
    </h2>
    <p>
      Bowls of hot coffee and milk, with white rolls of bread to dip in them,
      refreshed us at a forest inn. For some minutes after the meal Temple and I
      talked like interchangeing puffs of steam, but soon subsided to our
      staring fit. The pipes were lit again. What we heard sounded like a
      language of the rocks and caves, and roots plucked up, a language of
      gluttons feasting; the word ja was like a door always on the hinge in
      every mouth. Dumpy children, bulky men, compressed old women with baked
      faces, and comical squat dogs, kept the villages partly alive. We observed
      one young urchin sitting on a stone opposite a dog, and he and the dog
      took alternate bites off a platter-shaped cake, big enough to require both
      his hands to hold it. Whether the dog ever snapped more than his share was
      matter of speculation to us. It was an education for him in good manners,
      and when we were sitting at dinner we wished our companions had enjoyed
      it. They fed with their heads in their plates, splashed and clattered
      jaws, without paying us any hospitable attention whatever, so that we had
      the dish of Lazarus. They were perfectly kind, notwithstanding, and
      allowed a portion of my great map of Germany to lie spread over their
      knees in the diligence, whilst Temple and I pored along the lines of the
      rivers. One would thrust his square-nailed finger to the name of a city
      and pronounce it; one gave us lessons in the expression of the vowels,
      with the softening of three of them, which seemed like a regulation drill
      movement for taking an egg into the mouth, and showing repentance of the
      act. &lsquo;Sarkeld,&rsquo; we exclaimed mutually, and they made a galloping motion of
      their hands, pointing beyond the hills. Sarkeld was to the right, Sarkeld
      to the left, as the road wound on. Sarkeld was straight in front of us
      when the conductor, according to directions he had received, requested us
      to alight and push through this endless fir-forest up a hilly branch road,
      and away his hand galloped beyond it, coming to a deep place, and then to
      grapes, then to a tip-toe station, and under it lay Sarkeld. The pantomime
      was not bad. We waved our hand to the diligence, and set out cheerfully,
      with our bags at our backs, entering a gorge in the fir-covered hills
      before sunset, after starting the proposition&mdash;Does the sun himself
      look foreign in a foreign country?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he does,&rsquo; said Temple; and so I thought, but denied it, for by the
      sun&rsquo;s favour I hoped to see my father that night, and hail Apollo joyfully
      in the morning; a hope that grew with exercise of my limbs. Beautiful
      cascades of dark bright water leaped down the gorge; we chased an
      invisible animal. Suddenly one of us exclaimed, &lsquo;We &lsquo;re in a German
      forest&rsquo;; and we remembered grim tales of these forests, their awful
      castles, barons, knights, ladies, long-bearded dwarfs, gnomes and thin
      people. I commenced a legend off-hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Temple, as if curdling; &lsquo;let&rsquo;s call this place the mouth of
      Hades. Greek things don&rsquo;t make you feel funny.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed louder than was necessary, and remarked that I never had cared
      so much for Greek as on board Captain Welsh&rsquo;s vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s because he was all on the opposite tack I went on quoting,&rsquo; said
      Temple. &lsquo;I used to read with my father in the holidays, and your Rev.
      Simon has kept you up to the mark; so it was all fair. It &lsquo;s not on our
      consciences that we crammed the captain about our knowledge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. I&rsquo;m glad of it,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple pursued, &lsquo;Whatever happens to a fellow, he can meet anything so
      long as he can say&mdash;I &lsquo;ve behaved like a man of honour. And those
      German tales&mdash;they only upset you. You don&rsquo;t see the reason of the
      thing. Why is a man to be haunted half his life? Well, suppose he did
      commit a murder. But if he didn&rsquo;t, can&rsquo;t he walk through an old castle
      without meeting ghosts? or a forest?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The dusky scenery of a strange land was influencing Temple. It affected me
      so, I made the worst of it for a cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fancy those pines saying, &ldquo;There go two more,&rdquo; Temple. Well; and fancy
      this&mdash;a little earth-dwarf as broad as I&rsquo;m long and high as my
      shoulder. One day he met the loveliest girl in the whole country, and she
      promised to marry him in twenty years&rsquo; time, in return for a sack of
      jewels worth all Germany and half England. You should have seen her
      dragging it home. People thought it full of charcoal. She married the man
      she loved, and the twenty years passed over, and at the stroke of the hour
      when she first met the dwarf, thousands of bells began ringing through the
      forest, and her husband cries out, &ldquo;What is the meaning of it?&rdquo; and they
      rode up to a garland of fresh flowers that dropped on her head, and right
      into a gold ring that closed on her finger, and&mdash;look, Temple, look!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where?&rsquo; asked the dear little fellow, looking in all earnest, from which
      the gloom of the place may be imagined, for, by suddenly mixing it with my
      absurd story, I discomposed his air of sovereign indifference as much as
      one does the surface of a lake by casting a stone in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rounded the rocky corner of the gorge at a slightly accelerated pace in
      dead silence. It opened out to restorative daylight, and we breathed
      better and chaffed one another, and, beholding a house with pendent gold
      grapes, applauded the diligence conductor&rsquo;s expressive pantomime. The
      opportunity was offered for a draught of wine, but we held water
      preferable, so we toasted the Priscilla out of the palms of our hands in
      draughts of water from a rill that had the sound of aspen-leaves, such as
      I used to listen to in the Riversley meadows, pleasantly familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several commanding elevations were in sight, some wooded, some bare. We
      chose the nearest, to observe the sunset, and concurred in thinking it
      unlike English sunsets, though not so very unlike the sunset we had taken
      for sunrise on board the Priscilla. A tumbled, dark and light green
      country of swelling forest-land and slopes of meadow ran to the West, and
      the West from flaming yellow burned down to smoky crimson across it.
      Temple bade&mdash;me &lsquo;catch the disc&mdash;that was English enough.&rsquo; A
      glance at the sun&rsquo;s disc confirmed the truth of his observation. Gazing on
      the outline of the orb, one might have fancied oneself in England. Yet the
      moment it had sunk under the hill this feeling of ours vanished with it.
      The coloured clouds drew me ages away from the recollection of home.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tower on a distant hill, white among pines, led us to suppose that
      Sarkeld must lie somewhere beneath it. We therefore descended straight
      toward the tower, instead of returning to the road, and struck confidently
      into a rugged path. Recent events had given me the assurance that in my
      search for my father I was subject to a special governing direction. I had
      aimed at the Bench&mdash;missed it&mdash;been shipped across sea and
      precipitated into the arms of friends who had seen him and could tell me I
      was on his actual track, only blindly, and no longer blindly now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Follow the path,&rsquo; I said, when Temple wanted to have a consultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So we did in the London fog!&rsquo; said he, with some gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my retort: &lsquo;Hasn&rsquo;t it brought us here?&rsquo; was a silencer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dark night came on. Every height stood for a ruin in our eyes, every dip
      an abyss. It grew bewilderingly dark, but the path did not forsake us, and
      we expected, at half-hour intervals, to perceive the lights of Sarkeld,
      soon to be thundering at one of the inns for admission and supper. I could
      hear Temple rehearsing his German vocabulary, &lsquo;Brod, butter, wasser,
      fleisch, bett,&rsquo; as we stumbled along. Then it fell to &lsquo;Brod, wasser,
      bett,&rsquo; and then, &lsquo;Bett&rsquo; by itself, his confession of fatigue. Our path had
      frequently the nature of a waterway, and was very fatiguing, more
      agreeable to mount than descend, for in mounting the knees and shins bore
      the brunt of it, and these sufferers are not such important servants of
      the footfarer as toes and ankles in danger of tripping and being turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was walking on leveller ground, my head bent and eyes half-shut, when a
      flash of light in a brook at my feet caused me to look aloft. The tower we
      had marked after sunset was close above us, shining in a light of torches.
      We adopted the sensible explanation of this mysterious sight, but were
      rather in the grip of the superstitious absurd one, until we discerned a
      number of reddened men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Robbers!&rsquo; exclaimed one of us. Our common thought was, &lsquo;No; robbers would
      never meet on a height in that manner&rsquo;; and we were emboldened to mount
      and request their help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fronting the tower, which was of white marble, a high tent had been
      pitched on a green platform semicircled by pines. Torches were stuck in
      clefts of the trees, or in the fork of the branches, or held by boys and
      men, and there were clearly men at work beneath the tent at a busy rate.
      We could hear the paviour&rsquo;s breath escape from them. Outside the ring of
      torchbearers and others was a long cart with a dozen horses harnessed to
      it. All the men appeared occupied too much for chatter and laughter. What
      could be underneath the tent? Seeing a boy occasionally lift one of the
      flapping corners, we took licence from his example to appease our
      curiosity. It was the statue of a bronze horse rearing spiritedly. The
      workmen were engaged fixing its pedestal in the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our curiosity being satisfied, we held debate upon our immediate
      prospects. The difficulty of making sure of a bed when you are once
      detached from your home, was the philosophical reflection we arrived at,
      for nothing practical presented itself. To arm ourselves we pulled out
      Miss Goodwin&rsquo;s paper. &lsquo;Gasthof is the word!&rsquo; cried Temple. &lsquo;Gasthof,
      zimmer, bett; that means inn, hot supper, and bed. We&rsquo;ll ask.&rsquo; We asked
      several of the men. Those in motion shot a stare at us; the torchbearers
      pointed at the tent and at an unseen height, muttering &lsquo;Morgen.&rsquo; Referring
      to Miss Goodwin&rsquo;s paper we discovered this to signify the unintelligible
      word morning, which was no answer at all; but the men, apparently deeming
      our conduct suspicious, gave us to understand by rather menacing gestures
      that we were not wanted there, so we passed into the dusk of the trees,
      angry at their incivility. Had it been Summer we should have dropped and
      slept. The night air of a sharp season obliged us to keep active, yet we
      were not willing to get far away from the torches. But after a time they
      were hidden; then we saw one moving ahead. The holder of it proved to be a
      workman of the gang, and between us and him the strangest parley ensued.
      He repeated the word morgen, and we insisted on zimmer and bett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He takes us for twin Caspar Hausers,&rsquo; sighed Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nein,&rsquo; said the man, and, perhaps enlightened by hearing a foreign
      tongue, beckoned for us to step at his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lodging was a woodman&rsquo;s hut. He offered us bread to eat, milk to
      drink, and straw to lie on: we desired nothing more, and were happy,
      though the bread was black, the milk sour, the straw mouldy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our breakfast was like a continuation of supper, but two little girls of
      our host, whose heads were cased in tight-fitting dirty linen caps,
      munched the black bread and drank the sour milk so thankfully, while
      fixing solemn eyes of wonder upon us, that to assure them we were the same
      sort of creature as themselves we pretended to relish the stuff. Rather to
      our amazement we did relish it. &lsquo;Mutter!&rsquo; I said to them. They pointed to
      the room overhead. Temple laid his cheek on his hand. One of the little
      girls laid hers on the table. I said &lsquo;Doctor?&rsquo; They nodded and answered
      &lsquo;Princess,&rsquo; which seemed perfectly good English, and sent our conjectures
      as to the state of their mother&rsquo;s health astray. I shut a silver English
      coin in one of their fat little hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now, with the name Sarkeld, craved of their father a direction to that
      place. At the door of his but he waved his hand carelessly South for
      Sarkeld, and vigorously West where the tower stood, then swept both hands
      up to the tower, bellowed a fire of cannon, waved his hat, and stamped and
      cheered. Temple, glancing the way of the tower, performed on a trumpet of
      his joined fists to show we understood that prodigious attractions were
      presented by the tower; we said ja and ja, and nevertheless turned into
      the Sarkeld path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some minutes later the sound of hoofs led us to imagine he had despatched
      a messenger after us. A little lady on a pony, attended by a tawny-faced
      great square-shouldered groom on a tall horse, rode past, drew up on one
      side, and awaited our coming. She was dressed in a grey riding-habit and a
      warm winter-jacket of gleaming grey fur, a soft white boa loose round her
      neck, crossed at her waist, white gauntlets, and a pretty black felt hat
      with flowing rim and plume. There she passed as under review. It was a
      curious scene: the iron-faced great-sized groom on his bony black charger
      dead still: his mistress, a girl of about eleven or twelve or thirteen,
      with an arm bowed at her side, whip and reins in one hand, and slips of
      golden brown hair straying on her flushed cheek; rocks and trees, high
      silver firs rising behind her, and a slender water that fell from the
      rocks running at her pony&rsquo;s feet. Half-a-dozen yards were between the
      charger&rsquo;s head and the pony&rsquo;s flanks. She waited for us to march by,
      without attempting to conceal that we were the objects of her inspection,
      and we in good easy swing of the feet gave her a look as we lifted our
      hats. That look was to me like a net thrown into moonlighted water: it
      brought nothing back but broken lights of a miraculous beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burning to catch an excuse for another look over my shoulder, I heard her
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Young English gentlemen!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We turned sharp round.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was she without a doubt who had addressed us: she spurred her pony to
      meet us, stopped him, and said with the sweetest painful attempt at
      accuracy in pronouncing a foreign tongue:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I sthink you go a wrong way?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Our hats flew off again, and bareheaded, I seized the reply before Temple
      could speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is not this, may I ask you, the way to Sarkeld?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She gathered up her knowledge of English deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, one goes to Sarkeld by sthis way here, but to-day goes everybody up
      to our Bella Vista, and I entreat you do not miss it, for it is
      some-s-thing to write to your home of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Up at the tower, then? Oh, we were there last night, and saw the bronze
      horse, mademoiselle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I know. I called on my poor sick woman in a but where you fell
      asleep, sirs. Her little ones are my lambs; she has been of our household;
      she is good; and they said, two young, strange, small gentlemen have gone
      for Sarkeld; and I supposed, sthey cannot know all go to our Bella Vista
      to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You knew at once we were English, mademoiselle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I could read it off your backs, and truly too your English eyes are
      quite open at a glance. It is of you both I speak. If I but make my words
      plain! My &ldquo;th&rdquo; I cannot always. And to understand, your English is indeed
      heavy speech! not so in books. I have my English governess. We read
      English tales, English poetry&mdash;and sthat is your excellence. And so,
      will you not come, sirs, up when a way is to be shown to you? It is my
      question.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple thanked her for the kindness of the offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was hesitating, half conscious of surprise that I should ever be
      hesitating in doubt of taking the direction toward my father. Hearing
      Temple&rsquo;s boldness I thanked her also, and accepted. Then she said, bowing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg you will cover your heads.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We passed the huge groom bolt upright on his towering horse; he raised two
      fingers to the level of his eyebrows in the form of a salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple murmured: &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t mind entering the German Army,&rsquo; just as
      after our interview with Captain Bulsted he had wished to enter the
      British Navy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was no more than a sign that he was highly pleased. For my part
      delight fluttered the words in my mouth, so that I had to repeat half I
      uttered to the attentive ears of our gracious new friend and guide:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;one does sthink one knows almost all before experiment. I
      am ashamed, yet I will talk, for is it not so? experiment is a school. And
      you, if you please, will speak slow. For I say of you English gentlemen,
      silk you spin from your lips; it is not as a language of an alphabet; it
      is pleasant to hear when one would lull, but Italian can do that, and do
      it more&mdash;am I right? soft?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bella Vista, lovely view,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lovely view,&rsquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran on in the most musical tongue, to my thinking, ever heard:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And see my little pensioners&rsquo; poor cottage, who are out up to Lovely
      View. Miles round go the people to it. Good, and I will tell you
      strangers: sthe Prince von Eppenwelzen had his great ancestor, and his
      sister Markgrafin von Rippau said, &ldquo;Erect a statue of him, for he was a
      great warrior.&rdquo; He could not, or he would not, we know not. So she said,
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will do it in seven days.&rdquo; She does constantly
      amuse him, everybody at de Court. Immense excitement! For suppose it!&mdash;a
      statue of a warrior on horseback, in perfect likeness, chapeau tricorne,
      perruque, all of bronze, and his marshal&rsquo;s baton. Eh bien, well, a bronze
      horse is come at a gallop from Berlin; sthat we know. By fortune a most
      exalted sculptor in Berlin has him ready,&mdash;and many horses pulled him
      to here, to Lovely View, by post-haste; sthat we know. But we are in
      extremity of puzzlement. For where is the statue to ride him? where&mdash;am
      I plain to you, sirs?&mdash;is sthe Marshal Furst von Eppenwelzen, our
      great ancestor? Yet the Markgrafin says, &ldquo;It is right, wait!&rdquo; She nods,
      she smiles. Our Court is all at de lake-palace odder side sthe tower, and
      it is bets of gems, of feathers, of lace, not to be numbered! The
      Markgrafin says&mdash;sthere to-day you see him, Albrecht Wohlgemuth Furst
      von Eppenwelzen! But no sculptor can have cast him in bronze&mdash;not
      copied him and cast him in a time of seven days! And we say sthis:&mdash;Has
      she given a secret order to a sculptor&mdash;you understand me, sirs,
      commission&mdash;where, how, has he sthe likeness copied? Or did he come
      to our speisesaal of our lake-palace disguised? Oh! but to see, to copy,
      to model, to cast in bronze, to travel betwixt Berlin and Sarkeld in a
      time of seven days? No! so-oh! we guess, we guess, we are in exhaustion.
      And to-day is like an eagle we have sent an arrow to shoot and know not if
      he will come down. For shall we see our ancestor on horseback? It will be
      a not-scribable joy! Or not? So we guess, we are worried. At near eleven
      o&rsquo;clock a cannon fires, sthe tent is lifted, and we see; but I am
      impatient wid my breaths for de gun to go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I said it would be a fine sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For strangers, yes; you should be of de palace to know what a fine sight!
      sthe finest! And you are for Sarkeld? You have friends in Sarkeld?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My father is in Sarkeld, mademoiselle. I am told he is at the palace.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed; and he is English, your fater?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. I have not seen him for years; I have come to find him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed; it is for love of him, your fater, sir, you come, and not speak
      German?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I signified that it was so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She stroked her pony&rsquo;s neck musing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because, of love is not much in de family in England, it is said,&rsquo; she
      remarked very shyly, and in recovering her self-possession asked the name
      of my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His name, mademoiselle, is Mr. Richmond.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Richmond?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Richmond Roy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang in her saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are son to Mr. Richmond Roy? Oh! it is wonderful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mademoiselle, then you have seen him lately?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes! I have seen him. I have heard of his beautiful child, his son;
      and you it is?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She studied my countenance a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me, is he well?&rsquo; mademoiselle, is he quite well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; she answered, and broke into smiles of merriment, and then
      seemed to bite her underlip. &lsquo;He is our fun-maker. He must always be well.
      I owe to him some of my English. You are his son? you were for Sarkeld?
      You will see him up at our Bella Vista. Quick, let us run.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her pony to a canter up the brown path between the fir-trees,
      crying that she should take our breath; but we were tight runners, and I,
      though my heart beat wildly, was full of fire to reach the tower on the
      height; so when she slackened her pace, finding us close on her pony&rsquo;s
      hoofs, she laughed and called us brave boys. Temple&rsquo;s being no more than
      my friend, who had made the expedition with me out of friendship,
      surprised her. Not that she would not have expected it to be done by
      Germans; further she was unable to explain her astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a turning of the ascent she pointed her whip at the dark knots and
      lines of the multitude mounting by various paths to behold the ceremony of
      unveiling the monument.
    </p>
    <p>
      I besought her to waste no time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must, if you please, attend my pleasure, if I guide you,&rsquo; she said,
      tossing her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thank you, I can&rsquo;t tell you how much, mademoiselle,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered: &lsquo;You were kind to my two pet lambs, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So we moved forward.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. THE STATUE ON THE PROMONTORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The little lady was soon bowing to respectful salutations from crowds of
      rustics and others on a broad carriage-way circling level with the height.
      I could not help thinking how doubly foreign I was to all the world here&mdash;I
      who was about to set eyes on my lost living father, while these people
      were tip-toe to gaze on a statue. But as my father might also be taking an
      interest in the statue, I got myself round to a moderate sentiment of
      curiosity and a partial share of the general excitement. Temple and
      mademoiselle did most of the conversation, which related to glimpses of
      scenery, pine, oak, beech-wood, and lake-water, until we gained the
      plateau where the tower stood, when the giant groom trotted to the front,
      and worked a clear way for us through a mass of travelling sight-seers,
      and she leaned to me, talking quite inaudibly amid the laughter and
      chatting. A band of wind instruments burst out. &lsquo;This is glorious!&rsquo; I
      conceived Temple to cry like an open-mouthed mute. I found it inspiriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rush of pride and pleasure produced by the music was irresistible. We
      marched past the tower, all of us, I am sure, with splendid feelings. A
      stone&rsquo;s throw beyond it was the lofty tent; over it drooped a flag, and
      flags were on poles round a wide ring of rope guarded by foresters and
      gendarmes, mounted and afoot. The band, dressed in green, with black
      plumes to their hats, played in the middle of the ring. Outside were
      carriages, and ladies and gentlemen on horseback, full of animation;
      rustics, foresters, town and village people, men, women, and children,
      pressed against the ropes. It was a day of rays of sunshine, now from off
      one edge, now from another of large slow clouds, so that at times we and
      the tower were in a blaze; next the lake-palace was illuminated, or the
      long grey lake and the woods of pine and of bare brown twigs making bays
      in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several hands beckoned on our coming in sight of the carriages. &lsquo;There he
      is, then!&rsquo; I thought; and it was like swallowing my heart in one solid
      lump. Mademoiselle had free space to trot ahead of us. We saw a
      tall-sitting lady, attired in sables, raise a finger to her, and nip her
      chin. Away the little lady flew to a second carriage, and on again, as one
      may when alive with an inquiry. I observed to Temple, &lsquo;I wonder whether
      she says in her German, &ldquo;It is my question&rdquo;; do you remember?&rsquo; There was
      no weight whatever in what I said or thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rode back, exclaiming, &lsquo;Nowhere. He is nowhere, and nobody knows. He
      will arrive. But he is not yet. Now,&rsquo; she bent coaxingly down to me, &lsquo;can
      you not a few words of German? Only a smallest sum! It is the Markgrafin,
      my good aunt, would speak wid you, and she can no English-only she is
      eager to behold you, and come! You will know, for my sake, some scrap of
      German&mdash;ja? You will&mdash;nicht wahr? Or French? Make your
      glom-pudding of it, will you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I made a shocking plum-pudding of it. Temple was no happier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The margravine, a fine vigorous lady with a lively mouth and livelier eyes
      of a restless grey that rarely dwelt on you when she spoke, and constantly
      started off on a new idea, did me the honour to examine me, much as if I
      had offered myself for service in her corps of grenadiers, and might do in
      time, but was decreed to be temporarily wanting in manly proportions.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled a form of excuse of my bungling half-English horrid French,
      talked over me and at me, forgot me, and recollected me, all within a
      minute, and fished poor Temple for intelligible replies to
      incomprehensible language in the same manner, then threw her head back to
      gather the pair of us in her sight, then eyed me alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;C&rsquo;est peut-etre le fils de son petit papa, et c&rsquo;est tout dire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was her summary comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not satisfied with that, she leaned out of the carriage, and, making
      an extraordinary grimace appear the mother in labour of the difficult
      words, said, &lsquo;Doos yo&rsquo; laff?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no helping it: I laughed like a madman, giving one outburst and
      a dead stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far from looking displeased, she nodded. I was again put to the dreadful
      test.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can yo&rsquo; mak&rsquo; laff?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It spurred my wits. I had no speech to &lsquo;mak&rsquo; laff&rsquo; with. At the very
      instant of my dilemma I chanced to see a soberly-clad old townsman hustled
      between two helpless women of the crowd, his pipe in his mouth, and his
      hat, wig, and handkerchief sliding over his face, showing his bald crown,
      and he not daring to cry out, for fear his pipe should be trodden under
      foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He can, your Highness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her quick eyes caught the absurd scene. She turned to one of her ladies
      and touched her forehead. Her hand was reached out to me; Temple she
      patted on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He can&mdash;ja: du auch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A grand gentleman rode up. They whispered, gazed at the tent, and appeared
      to speak vehemently. All the men&rsquo;s faces were foreign: none of them had
      the slightest resemblance to my father&rsquo;s. I fancied I might detect him
      disguised. I stared vainly. Temple, to judge by the expression of his
      features, was thinking. Yes, thought I, we might as well be at home at old
      Riversley, that distant spot! We &lsquo;re as out of place here as frogs in the
      desert!
    </p>
    <p>
      Riding to and fro, and chattering, and commotion, of which the margravine
      was the centre, went on, and the band played beautiful waltzes. The
      workmen in and out of the tent were full of their business, like seamen
      under a storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fraulein Sibley,&rsquo; the margravine called.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hoped it might be an English name. So it proved to be; and the delight
      of hearing English spoken, and, what was more, having English ears to
      speak to, was blissful as the leap to daylight out of a nightmare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have the honour to be your countrywoman,&rsquo; said a lady, English all over
      to our struggling senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      We became immediately attached to her as a pair of shipwrecked boats
      lacking provender of every sort are taken in tow by a well-stored vessel.
      She knew my father, knew him intimately. I related all I had to tell, and
      we learnt that we had made acquaintance with her pupil, the Princess
      Ottilia Wilhelmina Frederika Hedwig, only child of the Prince of
      Eppenwelzen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your father will certainly be here; he is generally the margravine&rsquo;s
      right hand, and it&rsquo;s wonderful the margravine can do without him so long,&rsquo; 
      said Miss Sibley, and conversed with the margravine; after which she
      informed me that she had been graciously directed to assure me my father
      would be on the field when the cannon sounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps you know nothing of Court life?&rsquo; she resumed. &lsquo;We have very
      curious performances in Sarkeld, and we owe it to the margravine that we
      are frequently enlivened. You see the tall gentleman who is riding away
      from her. I mean the one with the black hussar jacket and thick brown
      moustache. That is the prince. Do you not think him handsome? He is very
      kind&mdash;rather capricious; but that is a way with princes. Indeed, I
      have no reason to complain. He has lost his wife, the Princess Frederika,
      and depends upon his sister the margravine for amusement. He has had it
      since she discovered your papa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is the gun never going off?&rsquo; I groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If they would only conduct their ceremonies without their guns!&rsquo; 
      exclaimed Miss Sibley. &lsquo;The origin of the present ceremony is this: the
      margravine wished to have a statue erected to an ancestor, a renowned
      soldier&mdash;and I would infinitely prefer talking of England. But never
      mind. Oh, you won&rsquo;t understand what you gaze at. Well, the prince did not
      care to expend the money. Instead of urging that as the ground of his
      refusal, he declared there were no sculptors to do justice to Prince
      Albrecht Wohlgemuth, and one could not rely on their effecting a likeness.
      We have him in the dining-hall; he was strikingly handsome. Afterward he
      pretended&mdash;I&rsquo;m speaking now of the existing Prince Ernest&mdash;that
      it would be ages before the statue was completed. One day the margravine
      induced him to agree to pay the sum stipulated for by the sculptor, on
      condition of the statue being completed for public inspection within eight
      days of the hour of their agreement. The whole Court was witness to it.
      They arranged for the statue, horse and man, to be exhibited for a quarter
      of an hour. Of course, the margravine did not signify it would be a
      perfectly finished work. We are kept at a great distance, that we may not
      scrutinize it too closely. They unveil it to show she has been as good as
      her word, and then cover it up to fix the rider to the horse,&mdash;a
      screw is employed, I imagine. For one thing we know about it, we know that
      the horse and the horseman travelled hither separately. In all
      probability, the margravine gave the order for the statue last autumn in
      Berlin. Now look at the prince. He has his eye on you. Look down. Now he
      has forgotten you. He is impatient to behold the statue. Our chief fear is
      that the statue will not maintain its balance. Fortunately, we have plenty
      of guards to keep the people from pushing against it. If all turns out
      well, I shall really say the margravine has done wonders. She does not
      look anxious; but then she is not one ever to show it. The prince does.
      Every other minute he is glancing at the tent and at his watch. Can you
      guess my idea? Your father&rsquo;s absence leads me to think-oh! only a passing
      glimmer of an idea&mdash;the statue has not arrived, and he is bringing it
      on. Otherwise, he would be sure to be here. The margravine beckons me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go!&rsquo; we cried simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess Ottilia supplied her place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have sent to our stables for two little pretty Hungarian horses for you
      two to ride,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;No, I have not yet seen him. He is asked for, and
      de Markgrafin knows not at all. He bades in our lake; he has been seen
      since. The man is exciteable; but he is so sensible. Oh, no. And he is
      full of laughter. We shall soon see him. Would he not ever be cautious of
      himself for a son like you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her compliment raised a blush on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The patience of the people was creditable to their phlegm. The smoke of
      pipes curling over the numberless heads was the most stirring thing about
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple observed to me,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll give the old statue a British cheer, won&rsquo;t we, Richie?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After coming all the way from England!&rsquo; said I, in dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, Richie; you&rsquo;re sure of him now. He &lsquo;s somewhere directing
      affairs, I suspect. I say, do let us show them we can ring out the right
      tune upon occasion. By jingo! there goes a fellow with a match.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We saw the cannonier march up to the margravine&rsquo;s carriage for orders. She
      summoned the prince to her side. Ladies in a dozen carriages were standing
      up, handkerchief in hand, and the gentlemen got their horses&rsquo; heads on a
      line. Temple counted nearly sixty persons of quality stationed there. The
      workmen were trooping out of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Sibley ran to us, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The gun-horror has been commanded. Now then: the prince can scarcely
      contain himself. The gunner is ready near his gun; he has his frightful
      match lifted. See, the manager-superintendent is receiving the
      margravine&rsquo;s last injunctions. How firm women&rsquo;s nerves are! Now the
      margravine insists on the prince&rsquo;s reading the exact time by her watch.
      Everybody is doing it. Let us see. By my watch it is all but fifteen
      minutes to eleven, A.M. Dearest,&rsquo; she addressed the little princess;
      &lsquo;would you not like to hold my hand until the gun is fired?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dearest,&rsquo; replied the princess, whether in childish earnest or irony I
      could not divine, &lsquo;if I would hold a hand it would be a gentleman&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      All eyes were on the Prince of Eppenwelzen, as he gazed toward the covered
      statue. With imposing deliberation his hand rose to his hat. We saw the
      hat raised. The cannon was fired and roared; the band struck up a pompous
      slow march: and the tent-veil broke apart and rolled off. It was like the
      dawn flying and sunrise mounting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I confess I forgot all thought of my father for awhile; the shouts of the
      people, the braying of the brass instruments, the ladies cheering sweetly,
      the gentlemen giving short, hearty expressions of applause, intoxicated
      me. And the statue was superb-horse and rider in new bronze polished by
      sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is life-like! it is really noble! it is a true Prince!&rsquo; exclaimed Miss
      Sibley. She translated several exclamations of the ladies and gentlemen in
      German: they were entirely to the same effect. The horse gave us a gleam
      of his neck as he pawed a forefoot, just reined in. We knew him; he was a
      gallant horse; but it was the figure of the Prince Albrecht that was so
      fine. I had always laughed at sculptured figures on horseback. This one
      overawed me. The Marshal was acknowledging the salute of his army after a
      famous victory over the infidel Turks. He sat upright, almost
      imperceptibly but effectively bending his head in harmony with the curve
      of his horse&rsquo;s neck, and his baton swept the air low in proud submission
      to the honours cast on him by his acclaiming soldiery. His three-cornered
      lace hat, curled wig, heavy-trimmed surcoat, and high boots, reminded me
      of Prince Eugene. No Prince Eugene&mdash;nay, nor Marlborough, had such a
      martial figure, such an animated high old warrior&rsquo;s visage. The bronze
      features reeked of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple and I felt humiliated (without cause, I granted) at the success of
      a work of Art that struck us as a new military triumph of these Germans,
      and it was impossible not to admire it. The little Princess Ottilia
      clapped hands by fits. What words she addressed to me I know not. I dealt
      out my stock of German&mdash;&lsquo;Ja, ja&mdash;to her English. We were drawn
      by her to congratulate the margravine, whose hand was then being kissed by
      the prince: he did it most courteously and affectionately. Other
      gentlemen, counts and barons, bowed over her hand. Ladies, according to
      their rank and privileges, saluted her on the cheek or in some graceful
      fashion. When our turn arrived, Miss Sibley translated for us, and as we
      were at concert pitch we did not acquit ourselves badly. Temple&rsquo;s remark
      was, that he wished she and all her family had been English. Nothing was
      left for me to say but that the margravine almost made us wish we had been
      German.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smiling cordially, the margravine spoke, Miss Sibley translated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her Royal Highness asks you if you have seen your father?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess Ottilia translated, &lsquo;Her Highness, my good aunt, would know,
      would you know him, did you see him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, anywhere,&rsquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The margravine pushed me back with a gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, your Highness, on my honour; anywhere on earth!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She declined to hear the translation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her insulting disbelief in my ability to recognize the father I had come
      so far to embrace would have vexed me but for the wretched thought that I
      was losing him again. We threaded the carriages; gazed at the horsemen in
      a way to pierce the hair on their faces. The little princess came on us
      hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, see, are the horses. I will you to mount. Are they not pretty
      animals?&rsquo; She whispered, &lsquo;I believe your fater have been hurt in his mind
      by something. It is only perhaps. Now mount, for de Markgrafin says you
      are our good guests.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We mounted simply to show that we could mount, for we would rather have
      been on foot, and drew up close to the right of the margravine&rsquo;s carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush! a poet is reading his ode,&rsquo; said the princess. &lsquo;It is Count Fretzel
      von Wolfenstein.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This ode was dreadful to us, and all the Court people pretended they liked
      it. When he waved his right hand toward the statue there was a shout from
      the rustic set; when he bowed to the margravine, the ladies and gentlemen
      murmured agreeably and smiled. We were convinced of its being downright
      hypocrisy, rustic stupidity, Court flattery. We would have argued our
      case, too. I proposed a gallop; Temple said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, we&rsquo;ll give the old statue our cheer as soon as this awful fellow has
      done. I don&rsquo;t care much for poetry, but don&rsquo;t let me ever have to stand
      and hear German poetry again for the remainder of my life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We could not imagine why they should have poetry read out to them instead
      of their fine band playing, but supposed it was for the satisfaction of
      the margravine, with whom I grew particularly annoyed on hearing Miss
      Sibley say she conceived her Highness to mean that my father was actually
      on the ground, and that we neither of us, father and son, knew one
      another. I swore on my honour, on my life, he was not present; and the
      melancholy in my heart taking the form of extreme irritation, I spoke
      passionately. I rose in my stirrups, ready to shout, &lsquo;Father! here&rsquo;s Harry
      Richmond come to see you. Where are you!&rsquo; I did utter something&mdash;a
      syllable or two: &lsquo;Make haste!&rsquo; I think the words were. They sprang from my
      inmost bosom, addressed without forethought to that drawling mouthing
      poet. The margravine&rsquo;s face met mine like a challenge. She had her lips
      tight in a mere lip-smile, and her eyes gleamed with provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her Highness,&rsquo; Miss Sibley translated, &lsquo;asks whether you are prepared to
      bet that your father is not on the ground?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beg her to wait two minutes, and I&rsquo;ll be prepared to bet any sum,&rsquo; said
      I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple took one half the circle, I the other, riding through the attentive
      horsemen and carriage-lines, and making sure the face we sought was
      absent, more or less discomposing everybody. The poet finished his ode; he
      was cheered, of course. Mightily relieved, I beheld the band resuming
      their instruments, for the cheering resembled a senseless beating on brass
      shields. I felt that we English could do it better. Temple from across the
      sector of the circle, running about two feet in front of the statue,
      called aloud,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Richie! he&rsquo;s not here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not here!&rsquo; cried I.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people gazed up at us, wondering at the tongue we talked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Richie! now let &lsquo;s lead these fellows off with a tiptop cheer!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Temple crowed lustily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The head of the statue turned from Temple to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the people falling back with amazed exclamations. I&mdash;so
      prepossessed was I&mdash;simply stared at the sudden-flashing white of the
      statue&rsquo;s eyes. The eyes, from being an instant ago dull carved balls, were
      animated. They were fixed on me. I was unable to give out a breath. Its
      chest heaved; both bronze hands struck against the bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Richmond! my son! Richie! Harry Richmond! Richmond Roy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That was what the statue gave forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      My head was like a ringing pan. I knew it was my father, but my father
      with death and strangeness, earth, metal, about him; and his voice was
      like a human cry contending with earth and metal-mine was stifled. I saw
      him descend. I dismounted. We met at the ropes and embraced. All his
      figure was stiff, smooth, cold. My arms slid on him. Each time he spoke I
      thought it an unnatural thing: I myself had not spoken once.
    </p>
    <p>
      After glancing by hazard at the empty saddle of the bronze horse, I called
      to mind more clearly the appalling circumstance which had stupefied the
      whole crowd. They had heard a statue speak&mdash;had seen a figure of
      bronze walk. For them it was the ancestor of their prince; it was the
      famous dead old warrior of a hundred and seventy years ago set thus in
      motion. Imagine the behaviour of people round a slain tiger that does not
      compel them to fly, and may yet stretch out a dreadful paw! Much so they
      pressed for a nearer sight of its walnut visage, and shrank in the act.
      Perhaps I shared some of their sensations. I cannot tell: my sensations
      were tranced. There was no warmth to revive me in the gauntlet I clasped.
      I looked up at the sky, thinking that it had fallen dark.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. MY FATHER BREATHES, MOVES, AND SPEAKS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The people broke away from us like furrowed water as we advanced on each
      side of the ropes toward the margravine&rsquo;s carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      I became a perfectly mechanical creature: incapable, of observing, just
      capable of taking an impression here and there; and in such cases the
      impressions that come are stamped on hot wax; they keep the scene fresh;
      they partly pervert it as well. Temple&rsquo;s version is, I am sure, the truer
      historical picture. He, however, could never repeat it twice exactly
      alike, whereas I failed not to render image for image in clear succession
      as they had struck me at the time. I could perceive that the figure of the
      Prince Albrecht, in its stiff condition, was debarred from vaulting, or
      striding, or stooping, so that the ropes were a barrier between us. I saw
      the little Princess Ottilia eyeing us with an absorbed comprehensive air
      quite unlike the manner of a child. Dots of heads, curious faces, peering
      and starting eyes, met my vision. I heard sharp talk in German, and a
      rider flung his arm, as if he wished to crash the universe, and flew off.
      The margravine seemed to me more an implacable parrot than a noble lady. I
      thought to myself: This is my father, and I am not overjoyed or grateful.
      In the same way, I felt that the daylight was bronze, and I did not wonder
      at it: nay, I reasoned on the probability of a composition of sun and
      mould producing that colour. The truth was, the powers of my heart and
      will were frozen; I thought and felt at random. And I crave excuses for
      dwelling on such trifling phenomena of the sensations, which have been
      useful to me by helping me to realize the scene, even as at the time they
      obscured it.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Temple&rsquo;s description, when the statue moved its head toward
      him, a shudder went through the crowd, and a number of forefingers were
      levelled at it, and the head moved toward me, marked of them all. Its
      voice was answered by a dull puling scream from women, and the men gaped.
      When it descended from the saddle, the act was not performed with one
      bound, as I fancied, but difficultly; and it walked up to me like a figure
      dragging logs at its heels. Half-a-dozen workmen ran to arrest it; some
      townswomen fainted. There was a heavy altercation in German between the
      statue and the superintendent of the arrangements. The sun shone
      brilliantly on our march to the line of carriages where the Prince of
      Eppenwelzen was talking to the margravine in a fury, and he dashed away on
      his horse, after bellowing certain directions to his foresters and the
      workmen, by whom we were surrounded; while the margravine talked loudly
      and amiably, as though everything had gone well. Her watch was out. She
      acknowledged my father&rsquo;s bow, and overlooked him. She seemed to have made
      her courtiers smile. The ladies and gentlemen obeyed the wave of her hand
      by quitting the ground; the band headed a long line of the commoner sort,
      and a body of foresters gathered the remnants and joined them to the rear
      of the procession. A liveried groom led away Temple&rsquo;s horse and mine.
      Temple declared he could not sit after seeing the statue descend from its
      pedestal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her Highness&rsquo;s behaviour roughened as soon as the place was clear of
      company. She spoke at my father impetuously, with manifest scorn and
      reproach, struck her silver-mounted stick on the carriage panels, again
      and again stamped her foot, lifting a most variable emphatic countenance.
      Princess Ottilia tried to intercede. The margravine clenched her hands,
      and, to one not understanding her speech, appeared literally to blow the
      little lady off with the breath of her mouth. Her whole bearing consisted
      of volleys of abuse, closed by magisterial interrogations. Temple compared
      her Highness&rsquo;s language to the running out of Captain Welsh&rsquo;s chaincable,
      and my father&rsquo;s replies to the hauling in: his sentences were short, they
      sounded like manful protestations; I barely noticed them. Temple&rsquo;s version
      of it went: &lsquo;And there was your father apologizing, and the margravine
      rating him,&rsquo; etc. My father, as it happened, was careful not to open his
      lips wide on account of the plaster, or thick coating of paint on his
      face. No one would have supposed that he was burning with indignation; the
      fact being, that to give vent to it, he would have had to exercise his
      muscular strength; he was plastered and painted from head to foot. The
      fixture of his wig and hat, too, constrained his skin, so that his looks
      were no index of his feelings. I longed gloomily for the moment to come
      when he would present himself to me in his natural form. He was not
      sensible of the touch of my hand, nor I of his. There we had to stand
      until the voluble portion of the margravine&rsquo;s anger came to an end. She
      shut her eyes and bowed curtly to our salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have seen the last of me, madam,&rsquo; my father said to her whirling
      carriage-wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to shake, and strained in his ponderous garments. Temple gazed
      abashed. I knew not how to act. My father kept lifting his knees on the
      spot as if practising a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tent was in its old place covering the bronze horse. A workman stepped
      ahead of us, and we all went at a strange leisurely pace down the hill
      through tall pinetrees to where a closed vehicle awaited us. Here were
      also a couple of lackeys, who deposited my father on a bed of moss, and
      with much effort pulled his huge boots off, leaving him in red silk
      stockings. Temple and I snatched his gauntlets; Temple fell backward, but
      we had no thought of laughter; people were seen approaching, and the three
      of us jumped into the carriage. I had my father&rsquo;s living hand in mine to
      squeeze; feeling him scarcely yet the living man I had sought, and with no
      great warmth of feeling. His hand was very moist. Often I said, &lsquo;Dear
      father!&mdash;Papa, I&rsquo;m so glad at last,&rsquo; in answer to his short-breathed
      &lsquo;Richie, my little lad, my son Richmond! You found me out; you found me!&rsquo; 
      We were conscious that his thick case of varnished clothing was against
      us. One would have fancied from his way of speaking that he suffered from
      asthma. I was now gifted with a tenfold power of observation, and let
      nothing escape me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple, sitting opposite, grinned cheerfully at times to encourage our
      spirits; he had not recovered from his wonderment, nor had I introduced
      him. My father, however, had caught his name. Temple (who might as well
      have talked, I thought) was perpetually stealing secret glances of
      abstracted perusal at him with a pair of round infant&rsquo;s eyes, sucking his
      reflections the while. My father broke our silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Temple, I have the honour,&rsquo; he said, as if about to cough; &lsquo;the
      honour of making your acquaintance; I fear you must surrender the hope of
      making mine at present.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple started and reddened like a little fellow detected in straying from
      his spelling-book, which was the window-frame. In a minute or so the
      fascination proved too strong for him; his eyes wandered from the window
      and he renewed his shy inspection bit by bit as if casting up a column of
      figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Mr. Temple, we are in high Germany,&rsquo; said my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must have cost Temple cruel pain, for he was a thoroughly gentlemanly
      boy, and he could not resist it. Finally he surprised himself in his
      stealthy reckoning: arrived at the full-breech or buttoned waistband,
      about half-way up his ascent from the red silk stocking, he would pause
      and blink rapidly, sometimes jump and cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      To put him at his ease, my father exclaimed, &lsquo;As to this exterior,&rsquo; he
      knocked his knuckles on the heaving hard surface, &lsquo;I can only affirm that
      it was, on horseback&mdash;ahem! particularly as the horse betrayed no
      restivity, pronounced perfect! The sole complaint of our interior concerns
      the resemblance we bear to a lobster. Human somewhere, I do believe myself
      to be. I shall have to be relieved of my shell before I can at all
      satisfactorily proclaim the fact. I am a human being, believe me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He begged permission to take breath a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know you for my son&rsquo;s friend, Mr. Temple: here is my son, my boy, Harry
      Lepel Richmond Roy. Have patience: I shall presently stand unshelled. I
      have much to relate; you likewise have your narrative in store. That you
      should have lit on me at the critical instant is one of those miracles
      which combine to produce overwhelming testimony&mdash;ay, Richie! without
      a doubt there is a hand directing our destiny.&rsquo; His speaking in such a
      strain, out of pure kindness to Temple, huskily, with his painful attempt
      to talk like himself, revived his image as the father of my heart and
      dreams, and stirred my torpid affection, though it was still torpid
      enough, as may be imagined, when I state that I remained plunged in
      contemplation of his stocking of red silk emerging from the full bronzed
      breech, considering whether his comparison of himself to a shell-fish
      might not be a really just one. We neither of us regained our true natures
      until he was free of every vestige of the garb of Prince Albrecht
      Wohlgemuth. Attendants were awaiting him at the garden-gate of a beautiful
      villa partly girdled by rising fir-woods on its footing of bright green
      meadow. They led him away, and us to bath-rooms.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. WE PASS A DELIGHTFUL EVENING, AND I HAVE A MORNING VISION
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a long saloon ornamented with stags&rsquo; horns and instruments of the
      chase, tusks of boars, spear-staves, boarknives, and silver horns, my
      father, I, and Temple sat down to a memorable breakfast, my father in his
      true form, dressed in black silken jacket and knee-breeches,
      purple-stockings and pumps; without a wig, I thanked heaven to see. How
      blithely he flung out his limbs and heaved his chest released from
      confinement! His face was stained brownish, but we drank old Rhine wine,
      and had no eye for appearances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you could bear it no longer, Richie?&rsquo; My father interrupted the
      narrative I doled out, anxious for his, and he began, and I interrupted
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You did think of me often, papa, didn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes brimmed with tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think of you!&rsquo; he sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave him the account of my latest adventures in a few panting breaths,
      suppressing the Bench. He set my face to front him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are two fools, Mr. Temple,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; said Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now you speak, papa,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Richie begins to remember me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I gazed at him to show it was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do, papa&mdash;I&rsquo;m not beginning to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At his request, I finished the tale of my life at school. &lsquo;Ah, well! that
      was bad fortune; this is good!&rsquo; he exclaimed. &lsquo;Tis your father, my son:
      &lsquo;tis day-light, though you look at it through a bed-curtain, and think you
      are half-dreaming. Now then for me, Richie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father went on in this wise excitedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was laying the foundation of your fortune here, my boy. Heavens! when I
      was in that bronze shell I was astonished only at my continence in not
      bursting. You have grown,&mdash;you have shot up and filled out. I
      register my thanks to your grandfather Beltham; the same, in a minor
      degree, to Captain Jasper Welsh. Between that man Rippenger and me there
      shall be dealings. He flogged you: let that pass. He exposed you to the
      contempt of your school-fellows because of a breach in my correspondence
      with a base-born ferule-swinger. What are we coming to? Richie, my son, I
      was building a future for you here. And Colonel Goodwin-Colonel Goodwin,
      you encountered him too, and his marriageable daughter&mdash;I owe it to
      them that I have you here! Well, in the event of my sitting out the period
      this morning as the presentment of Prince Albrecht, I was to have won
      something would have astonished that unimpressionable countryman of ours.
      Goodness gracious, my boy! when I heard your English shout, it went to my
      marrow. Could they expect me to look down on my own flesh and blood, on my
      son&mdash;my son Richmond&mdash;after a separation of years, and continue
      a statue? Nay, I followed my paternal impulse. Grant that the show was
      spoilt, does the Markgrafin insist on my having a bronze heart to carry on
      her pastime? Why, naturally, I deplore a failure, let the cause be what it
      will. Whose regrets can eclipse those of the principal actor? Quotha! as
      our old Plays have it. Regrets? Did I not for fifteen minutes and more of
      mortal time sit in view of a multitude, motionless, I ask you, like a
      chiselled block of stone,&mdash;and the compact was one quarter of an
      hour, and no farther? That was my stipulation. I told her&mdash;I can hold
      out one quarter of an hour: I pledged myself to it. Who, then, is to
      blame? I was exposed to view twenty-three minutes, odd seconds. Is there
      not some ancient story of a monstrous wretch baked in his own bull? My
      situation was as bad. If I recollect aright, he could roar; no such relief
      was allowed to me. And I give you my word, Richie, lads both, that while
      that most infernal Count Fretzel was pouring forth his execrable humdrum,
      I positively envied the privilege of an old palsied fellow, chief boatman
      of the forest lake, for, thinks I, hang him! he can nod his head and I can
      not. Let me assure you, twenty minutes of an ordeal like that,&mdash;one
      posture, mind you, no raising of your eyelids, taking your breath
      mechanically, and your heart beating&mdash;jumping like an enraged
      balletdancer boxed in your bosom&mdash;a literal description, upon my
      honour; and not only jumping, jumping every now and then, I may say, with
      a toe in your throat: I was half-choked:&mdash;well, I say, twenty
      minutes, twenty-seven minutes and a half of that, getting on, in fact, to
      half-an-hour, it is superhuman!&mdash;by heavens, it is heroical!
    </p>
    <p>
      And observe my reward: I have a son&mdash;my only one. I have been divided
      from him for years; I am establishing his fortune; I know he is provided
      with comforts: Richie, you remember the woman Waddy? A faithful soul! She
      obtained my consent at last&mdash;previously I had objections; in fact,
      your address was withheld from the woman&mdash;to call at your school. She
      saw Rippenger, a girl of considerable attractions. She heard you were
      located at Riversley: I say, I know the boy is comfortably provided for;
      but we have been separated since he was a little creature with curls on
      his forehead, scarce breeched.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I protested:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa, I have been in jacket and trousers I don&rsquo;t know how long.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me pursue,&rsquo; said my father. &lsquo;And to show you, Richie, it is a golden
      age ever when you and I are together, and ever shall be till we lose our
      manly spirit, and we cling to that,&mdash;till we lose our princely
      spirit, which we never will abandon&mdash;perish rather!&mdash;I drink to
      you, and challenge you; and, mind you, old Hock wine has charms. If
      Burgundy is the emperor of wines, Hock is the empress. For youngsters,
      perhaps, I should except the Hock that gets what they would fancy a trifle
      pique, turned with age, so as to lose in their opinion its empress
      flavour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple said modestly: &lsquo;I should call that the margravine of wines.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father beamed on him with great approving splendour. &lsquo;Join us, Mr.
      Temple; you are a man of wit, and may possibly find this specimen worthy
      of you. This wine has a history. You are drinking wine with blood in it.
      Well, I was saying, the darling of my heart has been torn from me; I am in
      a foreign land; foreign, that is, by birth, and on the whole foreign. Yes!&mdash;I
      am the cynosure of eyes; I am in a singular posture, a singular situation;
      I hear a cry in the tongue of my native land, and what I presume is my
      boy&rsquo;s name: I look, I behold him, I follow a parent&rsquo;s impulse. On my soul!
      none but a fish-father could have stood against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, for this my reward is&mdash;and I should have stepped from a
      cathedral spire just the same, if I had been mounted on it&mdash;that I,
      I,&mdash;and the woman knows all my secret&mdash;I have to submit to the
      foul tirade of a vixen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew language, I protest, from the slums. And I entreat you, Mr.
      Temple, with your &ldquo;margravine of wines&rdquo;&mdash;which was very neatly said,
      to be sure&mdash;note you this curious point for the confusion of Radicals
      in your after life; her Highness&rsquo;s pleasure was to lend her tongue to the
      language&mdash;or something like it&mdash;of a besotted fish-wife; so!
      very well, and just as it is the case with that particular old Hock you
      youngsters would disapprove of, and we cunning oldsters know to contain
      more virtues in maturity than a nunnery of May-blooming virgins, just so
      the very faults of a royal lady-royal by birth and in temper a termagant&mdash;impart
      a perfume! a flavour! You must age; you must live in Courts, you must
      sound the human bosom, rightly to appreciate it. She is a woman of the
      most malicious fine wit imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is a generous woman, a magnanimous woman; wear her chains and she will
      not brain you with her club. She is the light, the centre of every society
      where she appears, like what shall I say? like the moon in a bowl of old
      Rhenish. And you will drain that bowl to the bottom to seize her, as it
      were&mdash;catch a correct idea of her; ay, and your brains are drowned in
      the attempt. Yes, Richie; I was aware of your residence at Riversley. Were
      you reminded of your wandering dada on Valentine&rsquo;s day? Come, my boy, we
      have each of us a thousand things to relate. I may be dull&mdash;I do not
      understand what started you on your journey in search of me. An impulse?
      An accident? Say, a directing angel! We rest our legs here till evening,
      and then we sup. You will be astonished to hear that you have dined. &lsquo;Tis
      the fashion with the Germans. I promise you good wine shall make it up to
      you for the return to school-habits. We sup, and we pack our scanty
      baggage, and we start tonight. Brook no insult at Courts if you are of
      material value: if not, it is unreservedly a question whether you like
      kickings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father paused, yawned and stretched, to be rid of the remainder of his
      aches and stiffness. Out of a great yawn he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear lads, I have fallen into the custom of the country; I crave your
      permission that I may smoke. Wander, if you choose, within hail of me, or
      sit by me, if you can bear it, and talk of your school-life, and your
      studies. Your aunt Dorothy, Richie? She is well? I know not her like. I
      could bear to hear of any misfortune but that she suffered pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father smoked his cigar peacefully. He had laid a guitar on his knees,
      and flipped a string, or chafed over all the strings, and plucked and
      thrummed them as his mood varied. We chatted, and watched the going down
      of the sun, and amused ourselves idly, fermenting as we were. Anything
      that gave pleasure to us two boys pleased and at once occupied my father.
      It was without aid from Temple&rsquo;s growing admiration of him that I
      recovered my active belief and vivid delight in his presence. My younger
      days sprang up beside me like brothers. No one talked, looked, flashed,
      frowned, beamed, as he did! had such prompt liveliness as he! such
      tenderness! No one was ever so versatile in playfulness. He took the
      colour of the spirits of the people about him. His vivacious or sedate
      man-of-the-world tone shifted to playfellow&rsquo;s fun in a twinkling. I used
      as a little fellow to think him larger than he really was, but he was of
      good size, inclined to be stout; his eyes were grey, rather prominent, and
      his forehead sloped from arched eyebrows. So conversational were his eyes
      and brows that he could persuade you to imagine he was carrying on a
      dialogue without opening his mouth. His voice was charmingly clear; his
      laughter confident, fresh, catching, the outburst of his very self, as
      laughter should be. Other sounds of laughter were like echoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange to say, I lost the links of my familiarity with him when he left
      us on a short visit to his trunks and portmanteaux, and had to lean on
      Temple, who tickled but rejoiced me by saying: &lsquo;Richie, your father is
      just the one I should like to be secretary to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We thought it a pity to have to leave this nice foreign place immediately.
      I liked the scenery, and the wine, and what I supposed to be the habit of
      the gentlemen here to dress in silks. On my father&rsquo;s return to us I asked
      him if we could not stay till morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Till morning, then,&rsquo; he said: &lsquo;and to England with the first lark.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His complexion was ruddier; his valet had been at work to restore it; he
      was getting the sanguine hue which coloured my recollection of him.
      Wearing a black velvet cap and a Spanish furred cloak, he led us over the
      villa. In Sarkeld he resided at the palace, and generally at the
      lake-palace on the removal of the Court thither. The margravine had placed
      the villa, which was her own property, at his disposal, the better to work
      out their conspiracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would have been mine!&rsquo; said my father, bending suddenly to my ear, and
      humming his philosophical &lsquo;heigho,&rsquo; as he stepped on in minuet fashion. We
      went through apartments rich with gilded oak and pine panellings: in one
      was a rough pattern of a wooden horse opposite a mirror; by no means a
      figure of a horse, but apparently a number of pieces contributed by a
      carpenter&rsquo;s workshop, having a rueful seat in the middle. My father had
      practised the attitude of Prince Albrecht Wohlgemuth on it. &lsquo;She timed me
      five and twenty minutes there only yesterday,&rsquo; he said; and he now
      supposed he had sat the bronze horse as a statue in public view exactly
      thirty-seven minutes and a quarter. Tubs full of colouring liquid to soak
      the garments of the prince, pots of paint, and paint and plaster brushes,
      hinted the magnitude of the preparations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said my father in another apartment, &lsquo;I was this morning
      apparelled at seven o&rsquo;clock: and I would have staked my right arm up to
      the collar-bone on the success of the undertaking!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Weren&rsquo;t they sure to have found it out in the end, papa?&rsquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not so certain of that,&rsquo; he rejoined: &lsquo;I cannot quaff consolation
      from that source. I should have been covered up after exhibition; I should
      have been pronounced imperfect in my fitting-apparatus; the sculptor would
      have claimed me, and I should have been enjoying the fruits of a brave and
      harmless conspiracy to do honour to an illustrious prince, while he would
      have been moulding and casting an indubitable bronze statue in my image. A
      fig for rumours! We show ourself; we are caught from sight; we are again
      on show. Now this being successfully done, do you see, Royalty declines to
      listen to vulgar tattle. Presumably, Richie, it was suspected by the Court
      that the margravine had many months ago commanded the statue at her own
      cost, and had set her mind on winning back the money. The wonder of it was
      my magnificent resemblance to the defunct. I sat some three hours before
      the old warrior&rsquo;s portraits in the dining-saloon of the lake-palace.
      Accord me one good spell of meditation over a tolerable sketch, I warrant
      myself to represent him to the life, provided that he was a personage: I
      incline to stipulate for handsome as well. On my word of honour as a man
      and a gentleman, I pity the margravine&mdash;my poor good Frau
      Feldmarschall! Now, here, Richie,&rsquo;&mdash;my father opened a side-door out
      of an elegant little room into a spacious dark place, &lsquo;here is her
      cabinet-theatre, where we act German and French comediettas in Spring and
      Autumn. I have superintended it during the two or more years of my stay at
      the Court. Humph! &lsquo;tis over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He abruptly closed the door. His dress belonged to the part of a Spanish
      nobleman, personated by him in a Play called The Hidalgo Enraged, he said,
      pointing a thumb over his shoulder at the melancholy door, behind which
      gay scenes had sparkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa!&rsquo; said I sadly, for consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re change for a sovereign to the amount of four hundred and
      forty-nine thousand shillings every time you speak!&rsquo; cried he, kissing my
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sparkled in good earnest on hearing that I had made acquaintance with
      the little Princess Ottilia. What I thought of her, how she looked at me,
      what I said to her, what words she answered, how the acquaintance began,
      who were observers of it,&mdash;I had to repair my omission to mention her
      by furnishing a precise description of the circumstances, describing her
      face and style, repeating her pretty English.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father nodded: he thought I exaggerated that foreign English of hers;
      but, as I said, I was new to it and noticed it. He admitted the greater
      keenness of attention awakened by novelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I rather wonder&mdash;&rsquo; and here he smiled at me
      inquiringly. &lsquo;&lsquo;Tis true,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;a boy of fourteen or fifteen&mdash;ay,
      Richie, have your fun out. A youngster saw the comic side of her. Do you
      know, that child has a remarkable character? Her disposition is totally
      unfathomable. You are a deep reader of English poetry, I hope; she adores
      it, and the English Navy. She informed me that if she had been the English
      people she would have made Nelson king. The Royal family of England might
      see objections to that, I told her. Cries she: &ldquo;Oh! anything for a
      sea-hero.&rdquo; You will find these young princes and princesses astonishingly
      revolutionary when they entertain brains. Now at present, just at present,
      an English naval officer, and a poet, stand higher in the esteem of that
      young Princess Ottilia than dukes, kings, or emperors. So you have seen
      her!&rsquo; my father ejaculated musingly, and hummed, and said: &lsquo;By the way, we
      must be careful not to offend our grandpapa Beltham, Richie. Good acres&mdash;good
      anchorage; good coffers&mdash;good harbourage. Regarding poetry, my dear
      boy, you ought to be writing it, for I do&mdash;the diversion of leisure
      hours, impromptus. In poetry, I would scorn anything but impromptus. I was
      saying, Richie, that if tremendous misfortune withholds from you your
      legitimate prestige, you must have the substantial element. &lsquo;Tis your
      springboard to vault by, and cushions on the other side if you make a miss
      and fall. &lsquo;Tis the essence if you have not the odour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed my father&rsquo;s meaning as the shadow of a bird follows it in
      sunlight; it made no stronger an impression than a flying shadow on the
      grass; still I could verify subsequently that I had penetrated him&mdash;I
      had caught the outline of his meaning&mdash;though I was little accustomed
      to his manner of communicating his ideas: I had no notion of what he
      touched on with the words, prestige, essence, and odour.
    </p>
    <p>
      My efforts to gather the reason for his having left me neglected at school
      were fruitless. &lsquo;Business, business! sad necessity! hurry,
      worry-the-hounds!&rsquo; was his nearest approach to an explicit answer; and
      seeing I grieved his kind eyes, I abstained. Nor did I like to defend Mr.
      Rippenger for expecting to be paid. We came to that point once or twice,
      when so sharply wronged did he appear, and vehement and indignant, that I
      banished thoughts which marred my luxurious contentment in hearing him
      talk and sing, and behave in his old ways and new habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plain velvet was his dress at dinner. We had a yellow Hock. Temple&rsquo;s
      meditative face over it, to discover the margravine, or something, in its
      flavour, was a picture. It was an evening of incessant talking; no telling
      of events straightforwardly, but all by fits&mdash;all here and there. My
      father talked of Turkey, so I learnt he had been in that country; Temple
      of the routine of our life at Riversley; I of Kiomi, the gipsy girl; then
      we two of Captain Jasper Welsh; my father of the Princess Ottilia. When I
      alluded to the margravine, he had a word to say of Mrs. Waddy; so I learnt
      she had been in continual correspondence with him, and had cried heavily
      about me, poor soul. Temple laughed out a recollection of Captain
      Bulsted&rsquo;s &lsquo;hic, haec, hoc&rsquo;; I jumped Janet Ilchester up on the table; my
      father expatiated on the comfort of a volume of Shakespeare to an exiled
      Englishman. We drank to one another, and heartily to the statue. My father
      related the history of the margravine&rsquo;s plot in duck-and-drake skips, and
      backward to his first introduction to her at some Austrian Baths among the
      mountains. She wanted amusement&mdash;he provided it; she never let him
      quit her sight from that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;she has lost me!&rsquo; He drew out of his pocket-book a
      number of designs for the statue of Prince Albrecht, to which the
      margravine&rsquo;s initials were appended, and shuffled them, and sighed, and
      said: &lsquo;Most complete arrangements! most complete! No body of men were ever
      so well drilled as those fellows up at Bella Vista&mdash;could not have
      been! And at the climax, in steps the darling boy for whom I laboured and
      sweated, and down we topple incontinently! Nothing would have shaken me
      but the apparition of my son! I was proof against everything but that! I
      sat invincible for close upon an hour&mdash;call it an hour! Not a muscle
      of me moved: I repeat, the heart in my bosom capered like an independent
      organ; had it all its own way, leaving me mine, until Mr. Temple, take my
      word for it, there is a guiding hand in some families; believe it, and be
      serene in adversity. The change of life at a merry Court to life in a
      London alley will exercise our faith. But the essential thing is that
      Richie has been introduced here, and I intend him to play a part here. The
      grandson and heir of one of the richest commoners in England&mdash;I am
      not saying commoner as a term of reproach&mdash;possessed of a property
      that turns itself over and doubles itself every ten years, may&mdash;mind
      you, may&mdash;on such a solid foundation as that!&mdash;and as to birth,
      your Highness has only to grant us a private interview.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple was dazed by this mystifying address to him; nor could I understand
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, papa, you always wished for me to go into Parliament,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;and I wish you to lead the London great world. Such
      topics are for by-and-by. Adieu to them!&rsquo; He kissed his wafting
      finger-tips.
    </p>
    <p>
      We fell upon our random talk again with a merry rattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to give him a specimen of my piano-playing and singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &lsquo;The cricketer and the scholar have been developed at
      the expense of the musician; and music, Richie, music unlocks the chamber
      of satinrose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Late at night we separated. Temple and I slept in companion-rooms. Deadly
      drowsy, the dear little fellow sat on the edge of my bed chattering of his
      wonder. My dreams led me wandering with a ship&rsquo;s diver under the sea,
      where we walked in a light of pearls and exploded old wrecks. I was
      assuring the glassy man that it was almost as clear beneath the waves as
      above, when I awoke to see my father standing over me in daylight; and in
      an ecstasy I burst into sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, Richie&rsquo;&mdash;he pressed fresh violets on my nostrils&mdash;&lsquo;you
      have had a morning visitor. Quick out of bed, and you will see the little
      fairy crossing the meadow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I leapt to the window in time to have in view the little Princess Ottilia,
      followed by her faithful gaunt groom, before she was lost in the shadow of
      the fir-trees.

      CHAPTER XIX. OUR RETURN HOMEWARD
    </h2>
    <p>
      We started for England at noon, much against my secret wishes; but my
      father would not afford the margravine time to repent of her violent
      language and injustice toward him. Reflection increased his indignation.
      Anything that went wrong on the first stages of the journey caused him to
      recapitulate her epithets and reply to them proudly. He confided to me in
      Cologne Cathedral that the entire course of his life was a grand plot,
      resembling an unfinished piece of architecture, which might, at a future
      day, prove the wonder of the world: and he had, therefore, packed two
      dozen of hoar old (uralt: he used comical German) Hock for a present to my
      grandfather Beltham, in the hope of its being found acceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For, Richie,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you may not know&mdash;and it is not to win your
      thanks I inform you of it&mdash;that I labour unremittingly in my son&rsquo;s
      interests. I have established him, on his majority, in Germany, at a
      Court. My object now is to establish him in England. Promise me that it
      shall be the decided endeavour of your energies and talents to rise to the
      height I point out to you? You promise, I perceive,&rsquo; he added, sharp in
      detecting the unpleasant predicament of a boy who is asked to speak
      priggishly. So then I could easily promise with a firm voice. He dropped
      certain explosive hints, which reminded me of the funny ideas of my state
      and greatness I had when a child. I shrugged at them; I cared nothing for
      revelations to come by-and-by. My object was to unite my father and
      grandfather on terms of friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the view that now absorbed and fixed my mind. To have him a
      frequent visitor at Riversley, if not a resident in the house, enlivening
      them all, while I, perhaps, trifled a cavalry sabre, became one of my
      settled dreams. The difficult part of the scheme appeared to me the
      obtaining of my father&rsquo;s consent. I mentioned it, and he said immediately
      that he must have his freedom. &lsquo;Now, for instance,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;what is my
      desire at this moment? I have always a big one perched on a rock in the
      distance; but I speak of my present desire. And let it be supposed that
      the squire is one of us: we are returning to England. Well, I want to show
      you a stork&rsquo;s nest. We are not far enough South for the stork to build
      here. It is a fact, Richie, that I do want to show you the bird for luck,
      and as a feature of the country. And in me, a desire to do a thing
      partakes of the impetus of steam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, you see we are jogging home to England. I resist myself for duty&rsquo;s
      sake: that I can do. But if the squire were here with his yea and his nay,
      by heavens! I should be off to the top of the Rhine like a tornado. I
      submit to circumstances: I cannot, and I will not, be dictated to by men.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That seems to me rather unreasonable,&rsquo; I remonstrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is; I am ashamed of it,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;Do as you will, Richie; set me
      down at Riversley, but under no slight, mark you. I keep my honour intact,
      like a bottled cordial; my unfailing comfort in adversity! I hand it to
      you, my son, on my death-bed, and say, &ldquo;You have there the essence of my
      life. Never has it been known of me that I swallowed an insult.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, papa, I shall have a talk with the squire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Make good your ground in the castle,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I string a guitar
      outside. You toss me a key from the walls. If there is room, and I have
      leisure, I enter. If not, you know I am paving your way in other quarters.
      Riversley, my boy, is an excellent foothold and fortress: Riversley is not
      the world. At Riversley I should have to wear a double face, and, egad! a
      double stomach-bag, like young Jack feeding with the giant&mdash;one full
      of ambition, the other of provender. That place is our touchstone to
      discover whether we have prudence. We have, I hope. And we will have, Mr.
      Temple, a pleasant day or two in Paris.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his habit to turn off the bent of these conversations by drawing
      Temple into them. Temple declared there was no feeling we were in a
      foreign country while he was our companion. We simply enjoyed strange
      scenes, looking idly out of our windows. Our recollection of the strangest
      scene ever witnessed filled us with I know not what scornful pleasure, and
      laughed in the background at any sight or marvel pretending to amuse us.
      Temple and I cantered over the great Belgian battlefield, talking of Bella
      Vista tower, the statue, the margravine, our sour milk and black-bread
      breakfast, the little Princess Ottilia, with her &lsquo;It is my question,&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;You were kind to my lambs, sir,&rsquo; thoughtless of glory and dead bones. My
      father was very differently impressed. He was in an exultant glow, far
      outmatching the bloom on our faces when we rejoined him. I cried,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa, if the prince won&rsquo;t pay for a real statue, I will, and I&rsquo;ll present
      it in your name!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To the nation?&rsquo; cried he, staring, and arresting his arm in what seemed
      an orchestral movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To the margravine!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard, but had to gather his memory. He had been fighting the battle,
      and made light of Bella Vista. I found that incidents over which a day or
      two had rolled lost their features to him. He never smiled at
      recollections. If they were forced on him noisily by persons he liked,
      perhaps his face was gay, but only for a moment. The gaiety of his nature
      drew itself from hot-springs of hopefulness: our arrival in England, our
      interviews there, my majority Burgundy, my revisitation of Germany&mdash;these
      events to come gave him the aspect children wear out a-Maying or in an
      orchard. He discussed the circumstances connected with the statue as dry
      matter-of-fact, and unless it was his duty to be hilarious at the
      dinner-table, he was hardly able to respond to a call on his past life and
      mine. His future, too, was present tense: &lsquo;We do this,&rsquo; not &lsquo;we will do
      this&rsquo;; so that, generally, no sooner did we speak of an anticipated scene
      than he was acting in it. I studied him eagerly, I know, and yet quite
      unconsciously, and I came to no conclusions. Boys are always putting down
      the ciphers of their observations of people beloved by them, but do not
      add up a sum total.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our journey home occupied nearly eleven weeks, owing to stress of money on
      two occasions. In Brussels I beheld him with a little beggar-girl in his
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has asked me for a copper coin, Richie,&rsquo; he said, squeezing her fat
      cheeks to make cherries of her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recommended him to give her a silver one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something, Richie, I must give the little wench, for I have kissed her,
      and, in my list of equivalents, gold would be the sole form of repayment
      after that. You must buy me off with honour, my boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was compelled to receive a dab from the child&rsquo;s nose, by way of a kiss,
      in return for buying him off with honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child stumped away on the pavement fronting our hotel, staring at its
      fist that held the treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor pet wee drab of it!&rsquo; exclaimed my father. &lsquo;One is glad, Richie, to
      fill a creature out of one&rsquo;s emptiness. Now she toddles; she is digesting
      it rapidly. The last performance of one&rsquo;s purse is rarely so pleasant as
      that. I owe it to her that I made the discovery in time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner I also made the discovery that my father had no further
      supply of money, none whatever. How it had run out without his remarking
      it, he could not tell; he could only assure me that he had become aware of
      the fact while searching vainly for a coin to bestow on the beggar-girl. I
      despatched a letter attested by a notary of the city, applying for money
      to the banker to whom Colonel Goodwin had introduced me on my arrival on
      the Continent. The money came, and in the meantime we had formed
      acquaintances and entertained them; they were chiefly half-pay English
      military officers, dashing men. One, a Major Dykes, my father established
      in our hotel, and we carried him on to Paris, where, consequent upon our
      hospitalities, the purse was again deficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two reasons for not regretting it were adduced by my father; firstly, that
      it taught me not to despise the importance of possessing money; secondly,
      that we had served our country by assisting Dykes, who was on the scent of
      a new and terrible weapon of destruction, which he believed to be in the
      hands of the French Government. Major Dykes disappeared on the scent, but
      we had the satisfaction of knowing that we had done our best toward saving
      the Navy of Great Britain from being blown out of water. Temple and I
      laughed over Major Dykes, and he became our puppet for by-play, on account
      of his enormous whiskers, his passion for strong drinks, and his air of
      secresy. My father&rsquo;s faith in his patriotic devotedness was sufficient to
      withhold me from suspicions of his character. Whenever my instinct, or
      common sense, would have led me to differ with my father in opinion fun
      supervened; I was willing that everything in the world should be as he
      would have it be, and took up with a spirit of laughter, too happy in
      having won him, in having fished him out of the deep sea at one fling of
      the net, as he said, to care for accuracy of sentiment in any other
      particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our purse was at its lowest ebb; he suggested no means of replenishing it,
      and I thought of none. He had heard that it was possible to live in Paris
      upon next to nothing with very great luxury, so we tried it; we strolled
      through the lilac aisles among bonnes and babies, attended military
      spectacles, rode on omnibuses, dined on the country heights, went to
      theatres, and had a most pleasurable time, gaining everywhere front
      places, friendly smiles, kind little services, in a way that would have
      been incomprehensible to me but for my consciousness of the magical
      influence of my father&rsquo;s address, a mixture of the ceremonious and the
      affable such as the people could not withstand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The poet is perhaps, on the whole, more exhilarating than the alderman,&rsquo; 
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the respective names given by him to the empty purse and the
      full purse. We vowed we preferred the poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but for all that the alderman is lighter on his feet: I
      back him to be across the Channel first. The object of my instructions to
      you will be lost, Richie, if I find you despising the Alderman&rsquo;s Pegasus.
      On money you mount. We are literally chained here, you know, there is no
      doubt about it; and we are adding a nail to our fetters daily. True, you
      are accomplishing the Parisian accent. Paris has also this immense
      advantage over all other cities: &lsquo;tis the central hotel on the high-road
      of civilization. In Paris you meet your friends to a certainty; it catches
      them every one in turn; so now we must abroad early and late, and cut for
      trumps.&rsquo; A meeting with a friend of my father, Mr. Monterez Williams, was
      the result of our resolute adoption of this system. He helped us on to
      Boulogne, where my father met another friend, to whom he gave so sumptuous
      a dinner that we had not money enough to pay the hotel bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now observe the inconvenience of leaving Paris,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Ten to one we
      shall have to return. We will try a week&rsquo;s whistling on the jetty; and if
      no luck comes, and you will admit, Richie&mdash;Mr. Temple, I call your
      attention to it&mdash;that luck will scarcely come in profuse expedition
      through the narrow neck of a solitary seaport, why, we must return to
      Paris.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I proposed to write to my aunt Dorothy for money, but he would not hear of
      that. After two or three days of whistling, I saw my old friend, Mr.
      Bannerbridge, step out of the packetboat. On condition of my writing to my
      aunt to say that I was coming home, he advanced me the sum we were in need
      of, grudgingly though, and with the prediction that we should break down
      again, which was verified. It occurred only a stage from Riversley, where
      my grandfather&rsquo;s name was good as coin of the realm. Besides, my father
      remained at the inn to guarantee the payment of the bill, while Temple and
      I pushed on in a fly with the two dozen of Hock. It could hardly be called
      a break-down, but my father was not unwilling for me to regard it in that
      light. Among his parting remarks was an impressive adjuration to me to
      cultivate the squire&rsquo;s attachment at all costs.

    <p>
      &lsquo;Do this,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and I shall know that the lesson I have taught you on
      your journey homeward has not been thrown away. My darling boy! my curse
      through life has been that the sense of weight in money is a sense I am
      and was born utterly a stranger to. The consequence is, my grandest
      edifices fall; there is no foundation for them. Not that I am worse,
      understand me, than under a temporary cloud, and the blessing of heaven
      has endowed me with a magnificent constitution. Heaven forefend that I
      should groan for myself, or you for me! But digest what you have learnt,
      Richie; press nothing on the squire; be guided by the advice of that
      esteemed and admirable woman, your aunt Dorothy. And, by the way, you may
      tell her confidentially of the progress of your friendship with the
      Princess Ottilia. Here I shall employ my hours in a tranquil study of
      nature until I see you.&rsquo; Thus he sped me forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sighted Riversley about mid-day on a sunny June morning. Compared with
      the view from Bella Vista, our firs looked scanty, our heath-tracts dull,
      as places having no page of history written on them, our fresh green
      meadows not more than commonly homely. I was so full of my sense of
      triumph in my adventurous journey and the recovery of my father, that I
      gazed on the old Grange from a towering height. The squire was on the
      lawn, surrounded by a full company: the Ilchesters, the Ambroses, the
      Wilfords, Captain and Squire Gregory Bulsted, the Rubreys, and others, all
      bending to roses, to admire, smell, or pluck. Charming groups of ladies
      were here and there; and Temple whispered as we passed them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We beat foreigners in our women, Richie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I, making it my business to talk with perfect unconcern, replied
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think so? Perhaps. Not in all cases&rsquo;; all the while I was exulting
      at the sweet beams of England radiating from these dear
      early-morning-looking women.
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt Dorothy swam up to me, and, kissing me, murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take no rebuff from your grandpapa, darling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My answer was: &lsquo;I have found him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Bulsted sang out our names; I caught sight of Julia Rippenger&rsquo;s
      face; the squire had his back turned to me, which reminded me of my first
      speech with Captain Jasper Welsh, and I thought to myself, I know
      something of the world now, and the thing is to keep a good temper. Here
      there was no wire-coil to intercept us, so I fronted him quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hulloa!&rsquo; he cried, and gave me his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Temple is your guest, sir,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was obliged to stretch out his hand to Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      A prompt instinct warned me that I must show him as much Beltham as I
      could summon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dogs and horses all right, sir?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Bulsted sauntered near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, William,&rsquo; said the squire, &lsquo;tell this fellow about my stables.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In excellent condition, Harry Richmond,&rsquo; returned the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! he &lsquo;s got a new name, I &lsquo;ll swear,&rsquo; said the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not I!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then what have you got of your trip, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A sharper eye than I had, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been sharpening it in London, have you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been a little farther than London, squire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not a liar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, you see the lad can stand fire!&rsquo; Captain Bulsted broke in. &lsquo;Harry
      Richmond, I&rsquo;m proud to shake your hand, but I&rsquo;ll wait till you&rsquo;re through
      the ceremony with your grandad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire&rsquo;s hands were crossed behind him. I smiled boldly in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I make the tour of you to get hold of one of them, sir?&rsquo; He frowned
      and blinked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shuffle in among the ladies; you seem to know how to make friends among
      them,&rsquo; he said, and pretended to disengage his right hand for the purpose
      of waving it toward one of the groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      I seized it, saying heartily, &lsquo;Grandfather, upon my honour, I love you,
      and I&rsquo;m glad to be home again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mind you, you&rsquo;re not at home till you&rsquo;ve begged Uberly&rsquo;s pardon in
      public, you know what for,&rsquo; he rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leaving the horse at that inn is on my conscience,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire grumbled a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suppose he kicks?&rsquo; said I; and the captain laughed, and the squire too,
      and I was in such high spirits I thought of a dozen witty suggestions
      relative to the seat of the conscience, and grieved for a minute at going
      to the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the better; keep him there Captain Bulsted convoyed me to pretty
      Irish-eyed Julia Rippenger. Temple had previously made discovery of Janet
      Ilchester. Relating our adventures on different parts of the lawn, we both
      heard that Colonel Goodwin and his daughter had journeyed down to
      Riversley to smooth the way for my return; so my easy conquest of the
      squire was not at all wonderful; nevertheless, I maintained my sense of
      triumph, and was assured in my secret heart that I had a singular
      masterfulness, and could, when I chose to put it forth, compel my
      grandfather to hold out his hand to my father as he had done to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia Rippenger was a guest at Riversley through a visit paid to her by my
      aunt Dorothy in alarm at my absence. The intention was to cause the squire
      a distraction. It succeeded; for the old man needed lively prattle of a
      less childish sort than Janet Ilchester&rsquo;s at his elbow, and that young
      lady, though true enough in her fashion, was the ardent friend of none but
      flourishing heads; whereas Julia, finding my name under a cloud at
      Riversley, spoke of me, I was led to imagine by Captain Bulsted, as a
      ballad hero, a gloriful fellow, a darling whose deeds were all pardonable&mdash;a
      mere puff of smoke in the splendour of his nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To hear the young lady allude to me in that style!&rsquo; he confided to my
      ear, with an ineffable heave of his big chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain good influences, at any rate, preserved the squire from
      threatening to disinherit me. Colonel Goodwin had spoken to him very
      manfully and wisely as to my relations with my father. The squire, it was
      assumed by my aunt, and by Captain Bulsted and Julia, had undertaken to
      wink at my father&rsquo;s claims on my affection. All three vehemently entreated
      me to make no mention of the present of Hock to him, and not to attempt to
      bring about an interview. Concerning the yellow wine I disregarded their
      advice, for I held it to be a point of filial duty, and an obligation
      religiously contracted beneath a cathedral dome; so I performed the task
      of offering the Hock, stating that it was of ancient birth. The squire
      bunched his features; he tutored his temper, and said not a word. I
      fancied all was well. Before I tried the second step, Captain Bulsted rode
      over to my father, who himself generously enjoined the prudent course, in
      accordance with his aforegone precepts. He was floated off, as he termed
      it, from the inn where he lay stranded, to London, by I knew not what
      heaven-sent gift of money, bidding me keep in view the grand career I was
      to commence at Dipwell on arriving at my majority. I would have gone with
      him had he beckoned a finger. The four-and-twenty bottles of Hock were
      ranged in a line for the stable-boys to cock-shy at them under the
      squire&rsquo;s supervision and my enforced attendance, just as revolutionary
      criminals are executed. I felt like the survivor of friends, who had seen
      their blood flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed me a cheque for the payment of debts incurred in my recent
      adventures. Who could help being grateful for it? And yet his remorseless
      spilling of the kindly wine full of mellow recollections of my father and
      the little princess, drove the sense of gratitude out of me.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. NEWS OF A FRESH CONQUEST OF MY FATHER&rsquo;S
    </h2>
    <p>
      Temple went to sea. The wonder is that I did not go with him: we were both
      in agreement that adventures were the only things worth living for, and we
      despised English fellows who had seen no place but England. I could not
      bear the long separation from my father that was my reason for not
      insisting on the squire&rsquo;s consent to my becoming a midshipman. After
      passing a brilliant examination, Temple had the good fortune to join
      Captain Bulsted&rsquo;s ship, and there my honest-hearted friend dismally
      composed his letter of confession, letting me know that he had been untrue
      to friendship, and had proposed to Janet Ilchester, and interchanged vows
      with her. He begged my forgiveness, but he did love her so!&mdash;he hoped
      I would not mind. I sent him a reproachful answer; I never cared for him
      more warmly than when I saw the letter shoot the slope of the postoffice
      mouth. Aunt Dorothy undertook to communicate assurances of my undying
      affection for him. As for Janet&mdash;Temple&rsquo;s letter, in which he spoke
      of her avowed preference for Oriental presents, and declared his intention
      of accumulating them on his voyages, was a harpoon in her side. By means
      of it I worried and terrified her until she was glad to have it all out
      before the squire. What did he do? He said that Margery, her mother, was
      niggardly; a girl wanted presents, and I did not act up to my duty; I
      ought to buy Turkey and Tunis to please her, if she had a mind for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The further she was flattered the faster she cried; she had the face of an
      old setter with these hideous tears. The squire promised her fifty pounds
      per annum in quarterly payments, that she might buy what presents she
      liked, and so tie herself to constancy. He said aside to me, as if he had
      a knowledge of the sex&mdash;&lsquo;Young ladies must have lots of knickknacks,
      or their eyes &lsquo;ll be caught right and left, remember that.&rsquo; I should have
      been delighted to see her caught. She talked of love in a ludicrous
      second-hand way, sending me into fits of disgusted laughter. On other
      occasions her lips were not hypocritical, and her figure anything but
      awkward. She was a bold, plump girl, fond of male society. Heriot
      enraptured her. I believed at the time she would have appointed a year to
      marry him in, had he put the question. But too many women were in love
      with Heriot. He and I met Kiomi on the road to the race-course on the
      Southdowns; the prettiest racecourse in England, shut against gipsies. A
      bare-footed swarthy girl ran beside our carriage and tossed us flowers. He
      and a friend of his, young Lord Destrier, son of the Marquis of Edbury,
      who knew my father well, talked and laughed with her, and thought her so
      very handsome that I likewise began to stare, and I suddenly called
      &lsquo;Kiomi!&rsquo; She bounded back into the hedge. This was our second meeting. It
      would have been a pleasant one had not Heriot and Destrier pretended all
      sorts of things about our previous acquaintance. Neither of us, they said,
      had made a bad choice, but why had we separated? She snatched her hand out
      of mine with a grin of anger like puss in a fury. We had wonderful fun
      with her. They took her to a great house near the race-course, and there,
      assisted by one of the young ladies, dressed her in flowing silks, and so
      passed her through the gate of the enclosure interdicted to bare feet.
      There they led her to groups of fashionable ladies, and got themselves
      into pretty scrapes. They said she was an Indian. Heriot lost his wagers
      and called her a witch. She replied, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find I&rsquo;m one, young man,&rsquo; and
      that was the only true thing she spoke of the days to come. Owing to the
      hubbub around the two who were guilty of this unmeasured joke upon
      consequential ladies, I had to conduct her to the gate. Instantly, and
      without a good-bye, she scrambled up her skirts and ran at strides across
      the road and through the wood, out of sight. She won her dress and a piece
      of jewelry.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Heriot I went on a sad expedition, the same I had set out upon with
      Temple. This time I saw my father behind those high red walls, once so
      mysterious and terrible to me. Heriot made light of prisons for debt. He
      insisted, for my consolation, that they had but a temporary dishonourable
      signification; very estimable gentlemen, as well as scamps, inhabited
      them, he said. The impression produced by my visit&mdash;the feasting
      among ruined men who believed in good luck the more the lower they fell
      from it, and their fearful admiration of my imprisoned father&mdash;was as
      if I had drunk a stupefying liquor. I was unable clearly to reflect on it.
      Daily afterwards, until I released him, I made journeys to usurers to get
      a loan on the faith of the reversion of my mother&rsquo;s estate. Heriot, like
      the real friend he was, helped me with his name to the bond. When my
      father stood free, I had the proudest heart alive; and as soon as we had
      parted, the most amazed. For a long while, for years, the thought of him
      was haunted by racketballs and bearded men in their shirtsleeves; a scene
      sickening to one&rsquo;s pride. Yet it had grown impossible for me to think of
      him without pride. I delighted to hear him. We were happy when we were
      together. And, moreover, he swore to me on his honour, in Mrs. Waddy&rsquo;s
      presence, that he and the constable would henceforth keep an even pace.
      His exuberant cheerfulness and charming playfulness were always
      fascinating. His visions of our glorious future enchained me. How it was
      that something precious had gone out of my life, I could not comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia Rippenger&rsquo;s marriage with Captain Bulsted was, an agreeable
      distraction. Unfortunately for my peace of mind, she went to the altar
      poignantly pale. My aunt Dorothy settled the match. She had schemed it,
      her silence and half-downcast look seemed to confess, for the sake of her
      own repose, but neither to her nor to others did that come of it. I wrote
      a plain warning of the approaching catastrophe to Heriot, and received his
      reply after it was over, to this effect:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In my regiment we have a tolerable knowledge of women. They like change,
      old Richie, and we must be content to let them take their twenty shillings
      for a sovereign. I myself prefer the Navy to the Army; I have no right to
      complain. Once she swore one thing, now she has sworn another. We will
      hope the lady will stick to her choice, and not seek smaller change. &ldquo;I
      could not forgive coppers&rdquo;; that &lsquo;s quoting your dad. I have no wish to
      see the uxorious object, though you praise him. His habit of falling under
      the table is middling old-fashioned; but she may like him the better, or
      she may cure him. Whatever she is as a woman, she was a very nice girl to
      enliven the atmosphere of the switch. I sometimes look at a portrait I
      have of J. R., which, I fancy, Mrs. William Bulsted has no right to demand
      of me; but supposing her husband thinks he has, why then I must consult my
      brother officers. We want a war, old Richie, and I wish you were sitting
      at our mess, and not mooning about girls and women.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I presumed from this that Heriot&rsquo;s passion for Julia was extinct. Aunt
      Dorothy disapproved of his tone, which I thought admirably philosophical
      and coxcombi-cally imitable, an expression of the sort of thing I should
      feel on hearing of Janet Ilchester&rsquo;s nuptials.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daring and success of that foreign adventure of mine had, with the aid
      of Colonel and Clara Goodwin, convinced the squire of the folly of
      standing between me and him I loved. It was considered the best sign
      possible that he should take me down on an inspection of his various
      estates and his great coal-mine, and introduce me as the heir who would
      soon relieve him of the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he thought the smell of wealth a promising cure for such fits of
      insubordination as I had exhibited. My occasional absences on my own
      account were winked at. On my return the squire was sour and snappish, I
      cheerful and complaisant; I grew cold, and he solicitous; he would drink
      my health with a challenge to heartiness, and I drank to him heartily and
      he relapsed to a fit of sulks, informing me, that in his time young men
      knew when they were well off, and asking me whether I was up to any young
      men&rsquo;s villanies, had any concealed debts perchance, because, if so&mdash;Oh!
      he knew the ways of youngsters, especially when they fell into bad hands:
      the list of bad titles rumbled on in an underbreath like cowardly thunder:&mdash;well,
      to cut the matter short, because, if so, his cheque-book was at my
      service; didn&rsquo;t I know that, eh? Not being immediately distressed by debt,
      I did not exhibit the gush of gratitude, and my sedate &lsquo;Thank you, sir,&rsquo; 
      confused his appeal for some sentimental show of affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sure the poor old man suffered pangs of jealousy; I could even at
      times see into his breast and pity him. He wanted little more than to be
      managed; but a youth when he perceives absurdity in opposition to him
      chafes at it as much as if he were unaware that it is laughable. Had the
      squire talked to me in those days seriously and fairly of my father&rsquo;s
      character, I should have abandoned my system of defence to plead for him
      as before a judge. By that time I had gained the knowledge that my father
      was totally of a different construction from other men. I wished the
      squire to own simply to his loveable nature. I could have told him women
      did. Without citing my dear aunt Dorothy, or so humble a creature as the
      devoted Mrs. Waddy, he had sincere friends among women, who esteemed him,
      and were staunch adherents to his cause; and if the widow of the City
      knight, Lady Sampleman, aimed openly at being something more, she was not
      the less his friend. Nor was it only his powerful animation, generosity,
      and grace that won them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There occurred when I was a little past twenty, already much in his
      confidence, one of those strange crucial events which try a man publicly,
      and bring out whatever can be said for and against him. A young Welsh
      heiress fell in love with him. She was, I think, seven or eight months
      younger than myself, a handsome, intelligent, high-spirited girl, rather
      wanting in polish, and perhaps in the protecting sense of decorum. She was
      well-born, of course&mdash;she was Welsh. She was really well-bred too,
      though somewhat brusque. The young lady fell hopelessly in love with my
      father at Bath. She gave out that he was not to be for one moment accused
      of having encouraged her by secret addresses. It was her unsolicited
      avowal&mdash;thought by my aunt Dorothy immodest, not by me&mdash;that she
      preferred him to all living men. Her name was Anna Penrhys. The squire one
      morning received a letter from her family, requesting him to furnish them
      with information as to the antecedents of a gentleman calling himself
      Augustus Fitz-George Frederick William Richmond Guelph Roy, for purposes
      which would, they assured him, warrant the inquiry. He was for throwing
      the letter aside, shouting that he thanked his God he was unacquainted
      with anybody on earth with such an infernal list of names as that. Roy!
      Who knew anything of Roy?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It happens to be my father&rsquo;s present name,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It sounds to me like the name of one of those blackguard adventurers who
      creep into families to catch the fools,&rsquo; pursued the squire, not hearing
      me with his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The letter at least must be answered,&rsquo; my aunt Dorothy said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It shall be answered!&rsquo; the squire worked himself up to roar. He wrote a
      reply, the contents of which I could guess at from my aunt&rsquo;s refusal to
      let me be present at the discussion of it. The letter despatched was
      written by her, with his signature. Her eyes glittered for a whole day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a statement of the young lady&rsquo;s case from Bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look at that! look at that!&rsquo; cried the squire, and went on, &lsquo;Look at
      that!&rsquo; in a muffled way. There was a touch of dignity in his unforced
      anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt winced displeasingly to my sight: &lsquo;I see nothing to astonish one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing to astonish one!&rsquo; The squire set his mouth in imitation of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see nothing to astonish one? Well, ma&rsquo;am, when a man grows old enough
      to be a grandfather, I do see something astonishing in a child of nineteen&mdash;by
      George! it&rsquo;s out o&rsquo; nature. But you women like monstrosities. Oh! I
      understand. Here&rsquo;s an heiress to fifteen thousand a year. It&rsquo;s not
      astonishing if every ruined gambler and scapegrace in the kingdom&rsquo;s
      hunting her hot! no, no! that&rsquo;s not astonishing. I suppose she has her
      money in a coal mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire had some of his in a coal-mine; my mother once had; it was the
      delivery of a blow at my father, signifying that he had the scent for this
      description of wealth. I left the room. The squire then affected that my
      presence had constrained him, by bellowing out epithets easy for me to
      hear in the hall and out on the terrace. He vowed by solemn oath he was
      determined to save this girl from ruin. My aunt&rsquo;s speech was brief.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was summoned to Bath by my father in a curious peremptory tone implying
      the utmost urgent need of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I handed the letter to the squire at breakfast, saying, &lsquo;You must spare me
      for a week or so, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spread the letter flat with his knife, and turned it over with his
      fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harry,&rsquo; said he, half-kindly, and choking, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re better out of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m the best friend he could have by him, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re the best tool he could have handy, for you&rsquo;re a gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope I shan&rsquo;t offend you, grandfather, but I must go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, Harry Richmond, you&rsquo;re in for an infernal marriage
      ceremony there!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The young lady is not of age,&rsquo; interposed my aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh? An infernal elopement, then. It&rsquo;s clear the girl&rsquo;s mad-head&rsquo;s cracked
      as a cocoa-nut bowled by a monkey, brains nowhere. Harry, you&rsquo;re not a
      greenhorn; you don&rsquo;t suspect you&rsquo;re called down there to stop it, do you?
      You jump plump into a furious lot of the girl&rsquo;s relatives; you might as
      well take a header into a leech-pond. Come! you&rsquo;re a man; think for
      yourself. Don&rsquo;t have this affair on your conscience, boy. I tell you,
      Harry Richmond, I&rsquo;m against your going. You go against my will; you offend
      me, sir; you drag my name and blood into the mire. She&rsquo;s Welsh, is she?
      Those Welsh are addle-pated, every one. Poor girl!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw a horrible tremour into his accent of pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt expressed her view mildly, that I was sent for to help cure the
      young lady of her delusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And take her himself!&rsquo; cried the squire. &lsquo;Harry, you wouldn&rsquo;t go and do
      that? Why, the law, man, the law&mdash;the whole country &lsquo;d be up about
      it. You&rsquo;ll be stuck in a coloured caricature!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was really alarmed lest this should be one of the consequences of my
      going, and described some of the scourging caricatures of his day with an
      intense appreciation of their awfulness as engines of the moral sense of
      the public. I went nevertheless.

      CHAPTER XXI. A PROMENADE IN BATH
    </h2>
    <p>
      I found my father at his hotel, sitting with his friend Jorian DeWitt,
      whom I had met once before, and thought clever. He was an ex-captain of
      dragoons, a martyr to gout, and addicted to Burgundy, which necessitated
      his resorting to the waters, causing him, as he said, between his
      appetites and the penance he paid for them, to lead the life of a
      pendulum. My father was in a tempered gay mood, examining a couple of the
      county newspapers. One abused him virulently; he was supported by the
      other. After embracing me, he desired me to listen while he read out
      opposing sentences from the columns of these eminent journals:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The person calling himself &ldquo;Roy,&rdquo; whose monstrously absurd pretensions
      are supposed to be embodied in this self-dubbed surname...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;The celebrated and courtly Mr. Richmond Roy, known no less by the
      fascination of his manners than by his romantic history...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;has very soon succeeded in making himself the talk of the town...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;has latterly become the theme of our tea-tables...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;which is always the adventurer&rsquo;s privilege...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;through no fault of his own...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;That we may throw light on the blushing aspirations of a
      crow-sconced Cupid, it will be as well to recall the antecedents of this
      (if no worse) preposterous imitation buck of the old school...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;Suffice it, without seeking to draw the veil from those affecting
      chapters of his earlier career which kindled for him the enthusiastic
      sympathy of all classes of his countrymen, that he is not yet free from a
      tender form of persecution...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;We think we are justified in entitling him the Perkin Warbeck of
      society...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;Reference might be made to mythological heroes...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereat I cried out mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain DeWitt (stretched nursing a leg) removed his silk handkerchief
      from his face to murmur,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The bass stedfastly drowns the treble, if this is meant for harmony.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father rang up the landlord, and said to him,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The choicest of your cellar at dinner to-day, Mr. Lumley; and, mind you,
      I am your guest, and I exercise my right of compelling you to sit down
      with us and assist in consuming a doubtful quality of wine. We dine four.
      Lay for five, if your conscience is bad, and I excuse you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man smirked. He ventured to say he had never been so tempted to supply
      an inferior article.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father smiled on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You invite our editorial advocate?&rsquo; said Captain DeWitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our adversary,&rsquo; said my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      I protested I would not sit at table with him. But he assured me he
      believed his advocate and his adversary to be one and the same, and
      referred me to the collated sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The man must earn his bread, Richie, boy! To tell truth, it is the
      advocate I wish to rebuke, and to praise the adversary. It will confound
      him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It does me,&rsquo; said DeWitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You perceive, Jorian, a policy in dining these men of the Press now and
      occasionally, considering their growing power, do you not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, ay! it&rsquo;s a great gossiping machine, mon Roy. I prefer to let it
      spout.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I crave your permission to invite him in complimentary terms, cousin
      Jorian. He is in the town; remember, it is for the good of the nation that
      he and his like should have the opportunity of studying good society. As
      to myself personally, I give him carte blanche to fire his shots at me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the fashionable hour of the afternoon my father took my arm, Captain
      DeWitt a stick, and we walked into the throng and buzz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whenever you are, to quote our advocate, the theme of tea-tables,
      Richie,&rsquo; said my father, &lsquo;walk through the crowd: it will wash you. It is
      doing us the honour to observe us. We in turn discover an interest in its
      general countenance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was received, as we passed, with much staring; here and there a lifting
      of hats, and some blunt nodding that incensed me, but he, feeling me
      bristle, squeezed my hand and talked of the scene, and ever and anon
      gathered a line of heads and shed an indulgent bow along them-; so on to
      the Casino. Not once did he offend my taste and make my acute sense of
      self-respect shiver by appearing grateful for a recognition, or anxious to
      court it, though the curtest salute met his acknowledgement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior of the Casino seemed more hostile. I remarked it to him. &lsquo;A
      trifle more eye-glassy,&rsquo; he murmured. He was quite at his easy there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We walk up and down, my son,&rsquo; he said, in answer to a question of mine,
      &lsquo;because there are very few who can; even walking is an art; and if nobody
      does, the place is dull.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The place is pretty well supplied with newspapers,&rsquo; said Captain DeWitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And dowagers, friend Jorian. They are cousins. &lsquo;Tis the fashion to have
      our tattle done by machinery. They have their opportunity to compare the
      portrait with the original. Come, invent some scandal for us; let us make
      this place our social Exchange. I warrant a good bold piece of invention
      will fit them, too, some of them. Madam,&rsquo;&mdash;my father bowed low to the
      beckoning of a fan, &lsquo;I trust your ladyship did not chance to overhear that
      last remark I made?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady replied: &lsquo;I should have shut my eyes if I had. I called you to
      tell me, who is the young man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For twenty years I have lived in the proud belief that he is my son!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would not disturb it for the world.&rsquo; She did me the honour to inspect
      me from the lowest waistcoat button to the eyebrows. &lsquo;Bring him to me
      to-night. Captain DeWitt, you have forsaken my whist-tables.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Purely temporary fits of unworthiness, my lady.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In English, gout?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not gout in the conscience, I trust,&rsquo; said my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s curable,&rsquo; laughed the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You men of repartee would be nothing without your wickedness,&rsquo; the lady
      observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Man was supposed to be incomplete&mdash;&rsquo; Captain DeWitt affected a
      murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; and lifted eyes on my father. &lsquo;So you have not
      given up going to church?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent and spoke low.
    </p>
    <p>
      She humphed her lips. &lsquo;Very well, I will see. It must be a night in the
      early part of the week after next, then: I really don&rsquo;t know why I should
      serve you; but I like your courage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot consent to accept your ladyship&rsquo;s favour on account of one
      single virtue,&rsquo; said he, drooping.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waved him to move forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this frothy dialogue, I could see that the ear of the assembly had
      been caught by the sound of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That,&rsquo; my father informed me, &lsquo;is the great Lady Wilts. Now you will
      notice a curious thing. Lady Wilts is not so old but that, as our Jorian
      here says of her, she is marriageable. Hence, Richie, she is a queen to
      make the masculine knee knock the ground. I fear the same is not to be
      said of her rival, Lady Denewdney, whom our good Jorian compares to an
      antiquated fledgeling emerging with effort from a nest of ill construction
      and worse cement. She is rich, she is sharp, she uses her quill; she is
      emphatically not marriageable. Bath might still accept her as a rival
      queen, only she is always behindhand in seizing an occasion. Now you will
      catch sight of her fan working in a minute. She is envious and imitative.
      It would be undoubtedly better policy on her part to continue to cut me:
      she cannot, she is beginning to rustle like December&rsquo;s oaks. If Lady Wilts
      has me, why, she must. We refrain from noticing her until we have turned
      twice. Ay, Richie, there is this use in adversity; it teaches one to play
      sword and target with etiquette and retenue better than any crowned king
      in Europe. For me now to cross to her summons immediately would be a gross
      breach of homage to Lady Wilts, who was inspired to be the first to break
      through the fence of scandal environing me. But I must still show that I
      am independent. These people must not suppose that I have to cling to a
      party. Let them take sides; I am on fair terms with both the rivals. I
      show just such a nuance of a distinction in my treatment of them just such&mdash;enough,
      I mean, to make the flattered one warm to me, and t&rsquo; other be jealous of
      her. Ay, Richie, these things are trivial things beyond the grave; but
      here are we, my boy; and, by the way, I suspect the great campaign of my
      life is opening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain DeWitt said that if so it would be the tenth, to his certain
      knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not great campaign!&rsquo; my father insisted: &lsquo;mere skirmishes before this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They conversed in humorous undertones, each in turn seeming to turn over
      the earth of some amusing reminiscence, so rapt, that as far as regarded
      their perception of it, the assembly might have been nowhere. Perhaps,
      consequently, they became observed with all but undivided attention. My
      father&rsquo;s hand was on my shoulder, his head toward Captain DeWitt; instead
      of subduing his voice, he gave it a moderate pitch, at which it was not
      intrusive, and was musical, to my ear charming, especially when he
      continued talking through his soft laughter, like a hunter that would in
      good humour press for his game through links of water-nymphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Denewdney&rsquo;s fan took to beating time meditatively. Two or three times
      she kept it elevated, and in vain: the flow of their interchangeing speech
      was uninterrupted. At last my father bowed to her from a distance. She
      signalled: his eyelids pleaded short sight, awakening to the apprehension
      of a pleasant fact: the fan tapped, and he halted his march, leaning
      scarce perceptibly in her direction. The fan showed distress. Thereupon,
      his voice subsided in his conversation, with a concluding flash of
      animation across his features, like a brook that comes to the leap on a
      descent, and he left us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain DeWitt and I were led by a common attraction to the portico, the
      truth being that we neither of us could pace easily nor talk with perfect
      abandonment under eye-fire any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look,&rsquo; said he to me, pointing at the equipages and equestrians: &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll
      see a sight like this in dozens&mdash;dozens of our cities and towns! The
      wealth of this country is frightful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My reply, addressed at the same time mentally to Temple at sea, was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, as long as we have the handsomest women, I don&rsquo;t care.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain DeWitt was not so sure that we had. The Provencal women, the women
      of a part of South Germany, and certain favoured spots of Italy, might
      challenge us, he thought. This was a point I could argue on, or, I should
      rather say, take up the cudgels, for I deemed such opinions treason to
      one&rsquo;s country and an outrage to common sense, and I embarked in
      controversy with the single-minded intention of knocking down the man who
      held them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He accepted his thrashing complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now here comes a young lady on horseback,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;do you spy her? dark
      hair, thick eyebrows, rides well, followed by a groom. Is she a Beauty?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the heat of patriotism I declared she was handsome, and repeated it,
      though I experienced a twinge of remorse, like what I should have felt had
      I given Minerva the apple instead of Venus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; he commented, and stepped down to the road to meet her, beginning,
      in my hearing, &lsquo;I am the bearer of a compliment&mdash;&rsquo; Her thick eyebrows
      stood in a knot, then she glanced at me and hung pensive. She had not to
      wait a minute before my father came to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knew you would face them,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw back his head like a swimmer tossing spray from his locks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have read the paper?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have horsewhipped the writer?&rsquo; she rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! the poor penster!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, we can&rsquo;t pretend to pity him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Could we condescend to offer him satisfaction?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would he dare to demand it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will lay the case before Lady Wilts to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are there to-night?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At Lady Denewdney&rsquo;s to-morrow night&mdash;if I may indulge a hope?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Both? Oh! bravo, bravo! Tell me nothing more just now. How did you manage
      it? I must have a gallop. Yes, I shall be at both, be sure of that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father introduced me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me present to your notice my son, Harry Lepel Richmond, Miss
      Penrhys.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She touched my fingers, and nodded at me; speaking to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has a boy&rsquo;s taste: I hear he esteems me moderately well-favoured.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An inherited error certain to increase with age!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now you have started me!&rsquo; she exclaimed, and lashed the flanks of her
      horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had evidently been enacting a part deeply interesting to the population
      of Bath, for the heads of all the strolling groups were bent on us; and
      when Miss Penrhys cantered away, down dropped eyeglasses, and the
      promenade returned to activity. I fancied I perceived that my father was
      greeted more cordially on his way back to the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do well, Richie,&rsquo; he observed, &lsquo;in preserving your composure until
      you have something to say. Wait for your opening; it will come, and the
      right word will come with it. The main things are to be able to stand
      well, walk well, and look with an eye at home in its socket: I put you my
      hand on any man or woman born of high blood.&mdash;Not a brazen eye!&mdash;of
      the two extremes, I prefer the beaten spaniel sort.&mdash;Blindfold me,
      but I put you my hand on them. As to repartee, you must have it. Wait for
      that, too. Do not,&rsquo; he groaned, &lsquo;do not force it! Bless my soul, what is
      there in the world so bad?&rsquo; And rising to the upper notes of his groan:
      &lsquo;Ignorance, density, total imbecility, is better; I would rather any day
      of my life sit and carve for guests&mdash;the grossest of human trials&mdash;a
      detestable dinner, than be doomed to hear some wretched fellow&mdash;and
      you hear the old as well as the young&mdash;excruciate feelings which,
      where they exist, cannot but be exquisitely delicate. Goodness gracious
      me! to see the man pumping up his wit! For me, my visage is of an
      unalterable gravity whenever I am present at one of these exhibitions. I
      care not if I offend. Let them say I wish to revolutionize society&mdash;I
      declare to you, Richie boy, delightful to my heart though I find your keen
      stroke of repartee, still your fellow who takes the thrust gracefully,
      knows when he&rsquo;s traversed by a master-stroke, and yields sign of it,
      instead of plunging like a spitted buffalo and asking us to admire his
      agility&mdash;you follow me?&mdash;I say I hold that man&mdash;and I
      delight vastly in ready wit; it is the wine of language!&mdash;I regard
      that man as the superior being. True, he is not so entertaining.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father pressed on my arm to intimate, with a cavernous significance of
      eyebrow, that Captain DeWitt had the gift of repartee in perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jorian,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;will you wager our editor declines to dine with us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer struck me as only passable. I think it was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When rats smell death in toasted cheese.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain DeWitt sprang up the staircase of our hotel to his bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should not have forced him,&rsquo; my father mused. &lsquo;Jorian DeWitt has at
      times brilliant genius, Richie&mdash;in the way of rejoinders, I mean.
      This is his happy moment&mdash;his one hour&rsquo;s dressing for dinner. I have
      watched him; he most thoroughly enjoys it! I am myself a quick or slow
      dresser, as the case may be. But to watch Jorian you cannot help entering
      into his enjoyment of it. He will have his window with a view of the
      sunset; there is his fire, his warmed linen, and his shirt-studs; his
      bath, his choice of a dozen things he will or will not wear; the
      landlord&rsquo;s or host&rsquo;s menu is up against the looking-glass, and the
      extremely handsome miniature likeness of his wife, who is in the madhouse,
      by a celebrated painter, I forget his name. Jorian calls this, new birth&mdash;you
      catch his idea? He throws off the old and is on with the new with a highly
      hopeful anticipation. His valet is a scoundrel, but never fails in
      extracting the menu from the cook, wherever he may be, and, in fine, is
      too attentive to the hour&rsquo;s devotion to be discarded! Poor Jorian. I know
      no man I pity so much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I conceived him, I confessed, hardly pitiable, though not enviable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has but six hundred a year, and a passion for Burgundy,&rsquo; said my
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were four at table. The editor came, and his timidity soon wore off in
      the warmth of hospitality. He appeared a kind exciteable little man, glad
      of his dinner from the first, and in due time proud of his entertainer.
      His response to the toast of the Fourth Estate was an apology for its
      behaviour to my father. He regretted it; he regretted it. A vinous speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father heard him out. Addressing him subsequently,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would not interrupt you in the delivery of your sentiments,&rsquo; he said.
      &lsquo;I must, however, man to man, candidly tell you I should have wished to
      arrest your expressions of regret. They convey to my mind an idea, that on
      receipt of my letter of invitation, you attributed to me a design to
      corrupt you. Protest nothing, I beg. Editors are human, after all. Now, my
      object is, that as you write of me, you should have some knowledge of me;
      and I naturally am interested in one who does me so much honour. The facts
      of my life are at your disposal for publication and comment. Simply, I
      entreat you, say this one thing of me: I seek for justice, but I never
      complain of my fortunes. Providence decides:&mdash;that might be the motto
      engraven on my heart. Nay, I may risk declaring it is! In the end I shall
      be righted. Meanwhile you contribute to my happiness by favouring me with
      your society.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, sir,&rsquo; replied the little man, &lsquo;were all our great people like you! In
      the country&mdash;the provinces&mdash;they treat the representatives of
      the Fourth Estate as the squires a couple of generations back used to
      treat the parsons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! Have you got a place at their tables?&rsquo; inquired Captain DeWitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I cannot say that&mdash;not even below the salt. Mr. Richmond&mdash;Mr.
      Roy, you may not be aware of it: I am the proprietor of the opposition
      journals in this county. I tell you in confidence, one by itself would not
      pay; and I am a printer, sir, and it is on my conscience to tell you I
      have, in the course of business, been compelled this very morning to
      receive orders for the printing of various squibs and, I much fear,
      scurrilous things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father pacified him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will do your duty to your family, Mr. Hickson.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Deeply moved, the little man pulled out proof-sheets and slips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Even now, at the eleventh hour,&rsquo; he urged, &lsquo;there is time to correct any
      glaring falsehoods, insults, what not!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father accepted the copy of proofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a word,&mdash;not a line! You spoke of the eleventh hour, Mr.
      Hickson. If we are at all near the eleventh, I must be on my way to make
      my bow to Lady Wilts; or is it Lady Denewdney&rsquo;s to-night? No, to-morrow
      night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A light of satisfaction came over Mr. Hickson&rsquo;s face at the mention of my
      father&rsquo;s visiting both these sovereign ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as we were rid of him, Captain DeWitt exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If that&rsquo;s the Fourth Estate, what&rsquo;s the Realm?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Estate,&rsquo; pleaded my father, &lsquo;is here in its infancy&mdash;on all
      fours&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Prehensile! Egad, it has the vices of the other three besides its own. Do
      you mean that by putting it on all fours?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jorian, I have noticed that when you are malignant you are not witty. We
      have to thank the man for not subjecting us to a pledge of secresy. My
      Lady Wilts will find the proofs amusing. And mark, I do not examine their
      contents before submitting them to her inspection. You will testify to the
      fact.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was unaware that my father played a master-stroke in handing these
      proof-sheets publicly to Lady Wilts for her perusal. The incident of the
      evening was the display of her character shown by Miss Penrhys in
      positively declining to quit the house until she likewise had cast her eye
      on them. One of her aunts wept. Their carriage was kept waiting an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ask too much of me: I cannot turn her out&rsquo;, Lady Wilts said to her
      uncle. And aside to my father, &lsquo;You will have to marry her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In heaven&rsquo;s name keep me from marriage, my lady!&rsquo; I heard him reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was sincerity in his tone when he said that.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. CONCLUSION OF THE BATH EPISODE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The friends of Miss Penrhys were ill advised in trying to cry down a man
      like my father. Active persecution was the breath of life to him. When
      untroubled he was apt to let both his ambition and his dignity slumber.
      The squibs and scandal set afloat concerning him armed his wit, nerved his
      temper, touched him with the spirit of enterprise; he became a new
      creature. I lost sight of certain characteristics which I had begun to
      ponder over critically. I believed with all my heart that circumstances
      were blameable for much that did not quite please me. Upon the question of
      his magnanimity, as well as of his courage, there could not be two
      opinions. He would neither retort nor defend himself. I perceived some
      grandeur in his conduct, without, however, appreciating it cordially, as I
      did a refinement of discretion about him that kept him from brushing good
      taste while launched in ostentatious displays. He had a fine tact and a
      keen intuition. He may have thought it necessary to throw a little dust in
      my eyes; but I doubt his having done it, for he had only, as he knew, to
      make me jealous to blind me to his faults utterly, and he refrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his allusions to the young lady he was apologetic, affectionate; one
      might have fancied oneself listening to a gracious judge who had well
      weighed her case, and exculpated her from other excesses than that of a
      generous folly. Jorian DeWitt, a competent critic, pronounced his
      behaviour consummate at all points. For my behoof, he hinted antecedent
      reverses to the picture: meditating upon which, I traced them to the fatal
      want of money, and that I might be able to fortify him in case of need, I
      took my own counsel, and wrote to my aunt for the loan of as large a sum
      as she could afford to send. Her eagerness for news of our doings was
      insatiable. &lsquo;You do not describe her,&rsquo; she replied, not naming Miss
      Penrhys; and again, &lsquo;I can form no image of her. Your accounts of her are
      confusing. Tell me earnestly, do you like her? She must be very wilful,
      but is she really nice? I want to know how she appears to my Harry&rsquo;s
      mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father borrowed these letters, and returning them to me, said, &lsquo;A good
      soul! the best of women! There&mdash;there is a treasure lost!&rsquo; His
      forehead was clouded in speaking. He recommended me to assure my aunt that
      she would never have to take a family interest in Miss Penrhys. But this
      was not deemed perfectly satisfactory at Riversley. My aunt wrote: &lsquo;Am I
      to understand that you, Harry, raise objections to her? Think first
      whether she is in herself objectionable. She is rich, she may be prudent,
      she may be a forethoughtful person. She may not be able to support a
      bitter shock of grief. She may be one who can help. She may not be one
      whose heart will bear it. Put your own feelings aside, my dearest. Our
      duties cannot ever be clear to us until we do. It is possible for
      headstrong wilfulness and secret tenderness to go together. Think whether
      she is capable of sacrifice before you compel her to it. Do not inflict
      misery wantonly. One would like to see her. Harry, I brood on your future;
      that is why I seem to you preternaturally anxious about you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to me preternaturally anxious about Miss Penrhys.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father listened in silence to my flippant satire on women&rsquo;s letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered after a pause,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our Jorian says that women&rsquo;s letters must be read like anagrams. To put
      it familiarly, they are like a child&rsquo;s field of hop-scotch. You may have
      noticed the urchins at their game: a bit of tile, and a variety of
      compartments to pass it through to the base, hopping. Or no, Richie, pooh!
      &lsquo;tis an unworthy comparison, this hopscotch. I mean, laddie, they write in
      zigzags; and so will you when your heart trumpets in your ear. Tell her,
      tell that dear noble good woman&mdash;say, we are happy, you and I, and
      alone, and shall be; and do me the favour&mdash;she loves you, my son&mdash;address
      her sometimes&mdash;she has been it&mdash;call her &ldquo;mother&rdquo;; she will like
      it she deserves&mdash;nothing shall supplant her!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He lost his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sent me three hundred pounds; she must have supposed the occasion
      pressing. Thus fortified against paternal improvidence, I expended a
      hundred in the purchase of a horse, and staked the remainder on him in a
      match, and was beaten. Disgusted with the horse, I sold him for half his
      purchase-money, and with that sum paid a bill to maintain my father&rsquo;s
      credit in the town. Figuratively speaking, I looked at my hands as
      astonished as I had been when the poor little rascal in the street
      snatched my cake, and gave me the vision of him gorging it in the flurried
      alley of the London crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Money goes,&rsquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is the general experience of the nature of money,&rsquo; said my father
      freshly; &lsquo;but nevertheless you will be surprised to find how
      extraordinarily few are the people to make allowance for particular cases.
      It plays the trick with everybody, and almost nobody lets it stand as a
      plea for the individual. Here is Jorian, and you, my son, and perhaps your
      aunt Dorothy, and upon my word, I think I have numbered all I know&mdash;or,
      ay, Sukey Sampleman, I should not omit her in an honourable list&mdash;and
      that makes positively all I know who would commiserate a man touched on
      the shoulder by a sheriff&rsquo;s officer&mdash;not that such an indignity is
      any longer done to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope we have seen the last of Shylock&rsquo;s great-grandnephew,&rsquo; said I
      emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Merely to give you the instance, Richie. Ay! I hope so, I hope so! But it
      is the nature of money that you never can tell if the boarding&rsquo;s sound,
      once be dependent upon it. But this is talk for tradesmen.&rsquo; Thinking it so
      myself, I had not attempted to discover the source of my father&rsquo;s income.
      Such as it was, it was paid half-yearly, and spent within a month of the
      receipt, for the most signal proof possible of its shameful insufficiency.
      Thus ten months of the year at least he lived protesting, and many with
      him, compulsorily. For two months he was a brilliant man. I penetrated his
      mystery enough to abstain from questioning him, and enough to determine
      that on my coming of age he should cease to be a pensioner, petitioner,
      and adventurer. He aimed at a manifest absurdity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, after the lesson I had received as to the nature of
      money, I saw with some alarm my father preparing to dig a great pit for
      it. He had no doubt performed wonders. Despite of scandal and tattle, and
      the deadly report of a penniless fortune-hunter having fascinated the
      young heiress, he commanded an entrance to the receptions of both the
      rival ladies dominant. These ladies, Lady Wilts and Lady Denewdney, who
      moved each in her select half-circle, and could heretofore be induced by
      none to meet in a common centre, had pledged themselves to honour with
      their presence a ball he proposed to give to the choice world here
      assembled on a certain illuminated day of the calendar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I have now possession of Bath, Richie,&rsquo; said he, twinkling to
      propitiate me, lest I should suspect him of valuing his achievements
      highly. He had, he continued, promised Hickson of the Fourth Estate, that
      he would, before leaving the place, do his utmost to revive the ancient
      glories of Bath: Bath had once set the fashion to the kingdom; why not
      again? I might have asked him, why at all, or why at his expense; but his
      lead was irresistible. Captain DeWitt and his valet, and I, and a score of
      ladies, scores of tradesmen, were rushing, reluctant or not, on a torrent.
      My part was to show that I was an athlete, and primarily that I could
      fence and shoot. &lsquo;It will do no harm to let it be known,&rsquo; said DeWitt. He
      sat writing letters incessantly. My father made the tour of his fair
      stewardesses from noon to three, after receiving in audience his
      jewellers, linen-drapers, carpenters, confectioners, from nine in the
      morning till twelve. At three o&rsquo;clock business ceased. Workmen then
      applying to him for instructions were despatched to the bar of the hotel,
      bearing the recommendation to the barmaid not to supply them refreshment
      if they had ever in their lives been seen drunk. At four he dressed for
      afternoon parade. Nor could his enemy have said that he was not the chief
      voice and eye along his line of march. His tall full figure maintained a
      superior air without insolence, and there was a leaping beam in his large
      blue eyes, together with the signification of movement coming to his
      kindly lips, such as hardly ever failed to waken smiles of greeting.
      People smiled and bowed, and forgot their curiosity, forgot even to be
      critical, while he was in sight. I can say this, for I was acutely
      critical of their bearing; the atmosphere of the place was never perfectly
      pleasing to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My attitude of watchful reserve, and my reputation as the heir of immense
      wealth, tended possibly to constrain a certain number of the inimical
      party to be ostensibly civil. Lady Wilts, who did me the honour to
      patronize me almost warmly, complimented me on my manner of backing him,
      as if I were the hero; but I felt his peculiar charm; she partly admitted
      it, making a whimsical mouth, saying, in allusion to Miss Penrhys, &lsquo;I, you
      know, am past twenty. At twenty forty is charming; at forty twenty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Where I served him perhaps was in showing my resolution to protect him: he
      had been insulted before my arrival. The male relatives of Miss Penrhys
      did not repeat the insult; they went to Lady Wilts and groaned over their
      hard luck in not having the option of fighting me. I was, in her phrase, a
      new piece on the board, and checked them. Thus, if they provoked a
      challenge from me, they brought the destructive odour of powder about the
      headstrong creature&rsquo;s name. I was therefore of use to him so far. I leaned
      indolently across the rails of the promenade while she bent and chattered
      in his ear, and her attendant cousin and cavalier chewed vexation in the
      form of a young mustachio&rsquo;s curl. His horse fretted; he murmured deep
      notes, and his look was savage; but he was bound to wait on her, and she
      would not go until it suited her pleasure. She introduced him to me&mdash;as
      if conversation could be carried on between two young men feeling
      themselves simply pieces on the board, one giving check, and the other
      chafing under it! I need not say that I disliked my situation. It was
      worse when my father took to bowing to her from a distance, unobservant of
      her hand&rsquo;s prompt pull at the reins as soon as she saw him. Lady Wilts had
      assumed the right of a woman still possessing attractions to exert her
      influence with him on behalf of the family, for I had done my best to
      convince her that he entertained no serious thought of marrying, and
      decidedly would not marry without my approval. He acted on her advice to
      discourage the wilful girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is it I am so hateful to you?&rsquo; Miss Penrhys accosted me abruptly. I
      fancied she must have gone mad, and an interrogative frown was my sole
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I hear that you pronounce me everywhere unendurable,&rsquo; she continued.
      &lsquo;You are young, and you misjudge me in some way, and I should be glad if
      you knew me better. By-and-by, in Wales.&mdash;Are you fond of mountain
      scenery? We might be good friends; my temper is not bad&mdash;at least, I
      hope not. Heaven knows what one&rsquo;s relatives think of one. Will you visit
      us? I hear you have promised your confidante, Lady Wilts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At a dancing party where we met, she was thrown on my hands by her
      ungovernable vehemence, and I, as I had told Lady Wilts, not being able to
      understand the liking of twenty for forty (fifty would have been nearer
      the actual mark, or sixty), offered her no lively sympathy. I believe she
      had requested my father to pay public court to her. If Captain DeWitt was
      to be trusted, she desired him to dance, and dance with her exclusively,
      and so confirm and defy the tattle of the town; but my father hovered
      between the dowagers. She in consequence declined to dance, which was the
      next worse thing she could do. An aunt, a miserable woman, was on her
      left; on her right she contrived, too frequently for my peace of mind, to
      reserve a vacant place for me, and she eyed me intently across the room,
      under her persistent brows, until perforce I was drawn to her side. I had
      to listen to a repetition of sharp queries and replies, and affect a
      flattered gaiety, feeling myself most uncomfortably, as Captain DeWitt
      (who watched us) said, Chip the son of Block the father. By fixing the son
      beside her, she defeated the father&rsquo;s scheme of coldness, and made it
      appear a concerted piece of policy. Even I saw that. I saw more than I
      grasped. Love for my father was to my mind a natural thing, a proof of
      taste and goodness; women might love him; but the love of a young girl
      with the morning&rsquo;s mystery about her! and for my progenitor!&mdash;a girl
      (as I reflected in the midst of my interjections) well-built, clear-eyed,
      animated, clever, with soft white hands and pretty feet; how could it be?
      She was sombre as a sunken fire until he at last came round to her, and
      then her sudden vivacity was surprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Affairs were no further advanced when I had to obey the squire&rsquo;s commands
      and return to Riversley, missing the night of the grand ball with no
      profound regret, except for my father&rsquo;s sake. He wrote soon after one of
      his characteristic letters, to tell me that the ball had, been a success.
      Immediately upon this announcement, he indulged luxurious reflections, as
      his manner was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To have stirred up the old place and given it something to dream of for
      the next half century, is a satisfaction, Richie. I have a kindness for
      Bath. I leave it with its factions reconciled, its tea-tables furnished
      with inexhaustible supplies of the chief thing necessary, and the
      persuasion firmly established in my own bosom that it is impossible to
      revive the past, so we must march with the age. And let me add, all but
      every one of the bills happily discharged, to please you. Pray, fag at
      your German. If (as I myself confess to) you have enjoyment of old ways,
      habits, customs, and ceremonies, look to Court life. It is only in Courts
      that a man may now air a leg; and there the women are works of Art. If you
      are deficient in calves (which my boy, thank heaven! will never be charged
      with) you are there found out, and in fact every deficiency, every
      qualification, is at once in patent exhibition at a Court. I fancy
      Parliament for you still, and that is no impediment as a step. Jorian
      would have you sit and wallow in ease, and buy (by the way, we might think
      of it) a famous Burgundy vineyard (for an investment), devote the prime of
      your life to the discovery of a cook, your manhood to perfect the
      creature&rsquo;s education&mdash;so forth; I imagine you are to get five years
      of ample gratification (a promise hardly to be relied on) in the sere
      leaf, and so perish. Take poor Jorian for an example of what the absence
      of ambition brings men to. I treasure Jorian, I hoard the poor fellow, to
      have him for a lesson to my boy. Witty and shrewd, and a masterly
      tactician (I wager he would have won his spurs on the field of battle),
      you see him now living for one hour of the day&mdash;absolutely
      twenty-three hours of the man&rsquo;s life are chained slaves, beasts of burden,
      to the four-and-twentieth! So, I repeat, fag at your German.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Penrhys retires to her native Wales; Jorian and I on to London, to
      the Continent. Plinlimmon guard us all! I send you our local newspapers.
      That I cut entrechats is false. It happens to be a thing I could do, and
      not an Englishman in England except myself; only I did not do it. I did
      appear in what I was educated to believe was the evening suit of a
      gentleman, and I cannot perceive the immodesty of showing my leg. A dress
      that is not indecent, and is becoming to me, and is the dress of my
      fathers, I wear, and I impose it on the generation of my sex. However, I
      dined Hickson of the Fourth Estate (Jorian considers him hungry enough to
      eat up his twentieth before he dies&mdash;I forget the wording of the
      mot), that he might know I was without rancour in the end, as originally I
      had been without any intention of purchasing his allegiance. He offered me
      his columns; he wished me luck with the heiress; by his Gods, he swore he
      worshipped entrechats, and held a silk leg the most admirable work of the
      manufactures. &ldquo;Sir, you&rsquo;re a gentleman,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a nobleman, sir;
      you &lsquo;re a prince, you &lsquo;re a star of the first magnitude.&rdquo; Cries Jorian,
      &ldquo;Retract that, scum! you see nothing large but what you dare to think
      neighbours you,&rdquo; and quarrels the inebriate dog. And this is the maker and
      destroyer of reputations in his day! I study Hickson as a miraculous
      engine of the very simplest contrivance; he is himself the epitome of a
      verdict on his period. Next day he disclaimed in his opposition penny
      sheet the report of the entrechats, and &ldquo;the spectators laughing
      consumedly,&rdquo; and sent me (as I had requested him to do) the names of his
      daughters, to whom I transmit little comforting presents, for if they are
      nice children such a parent must afflict them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cultivate Lady Wilts. You have made an impression. She puts you forward
      as a good specimen of our young men. &lsquo;Hem! madam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, my dear boy, as I said, we cannot revive the past. I acknowledge it.
      Bath rebukes my last fit of ambition, and the experience is very well
      worth the expense. You have a mind, Richie, for discussing outlay, upon
      which I congratulate you, so long as you do not overlook equivalents. The
      system of the world is barter varied by robbery. Show that you have
      something in hand, and you enjoy the satisfaction of knowing that you were
      not robbed. I pledge you my word to it&mdash;I shall not repeat Bath. And
      mark you, an heiress is never compromised. I am not, I hope, responsible
      for every creature caught up in my circle of attraction. Believe me, dear
      boy, I should consult you, and another one, estimable beyond mortal
      speech! if I had become involved&mdash;impossible! No; I am free of all
      fresh chains, because of the old ones. Years will not be sufficient for us
      when you and I once begin to talk in earnest, when I open! To resume&mdash;so
      I leave Bath with a light conscience. Mixed with pleasant recollections is
      the transient regret that you were not a spectator of the meeting of the
      Wilts and Denewdney streams. Jorian compared them to the Rhone and the&mdash;I
      forget the name of the river below Geneva&mdash;dirtyish; for there was a
      transparent difference in the Denewdney style of dress, and did I choose
      it I could sit and rule those two factions as despotically as Buonaparte
      his Frenchmen. Ask me what I mean by scaling billows, Richie. I will some
      day tell you. I have done it all my life, and here I am. But I thank
      heaven I have a son I love, and I can match him against the best on earth,
      and henceforward I live for him, to vindicate and right the boy, and place
      him in his legitimate sphere. From this time I take to looking exclusively
      forward, and I labour diligently. I have energies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not to boast, darling old son, I tell truth; I am only happy when my
      heart is beating near you. Here comes the mother in me pumping up. Adieu.
      Lebe wohl. The German!&mdash;the German!&mdash;may God in his
      Barmherzigkeit!&mdash;Tell her I never encouraged the girl, have literally
      nothing to trace a temporary wrinkle on my forehead as regards conscience.
      I say, may it please Providence to make you a good German scholar by the
      day of your majority. Hurrah for it! Present my humble warm respects to
      your aunt Dorothy. I pray to heaven nightly for one of its angels on
      earth. Kunst, Wissenschaft, Ehre, Liebe. Die Liebe. Quick at the German
      poets. Frau: Fraulein. I am actually dazzled at the prospect of our
      future. To be candid, I no longer see to write. Gruss&rsquo; dich herzlich. From
      Vienna to you next. Lebe wohl!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt Dorothy sent a glance at the letter while I was folding it
      evidently thinking my unwillingness to offer it a sign of bad news or
      fresh complications. She spoke of Miss Penrhys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s over,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;Heiresses soon get consoled.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She accused me of having picked up a vulgar idea. I maintained that it was
      my father&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It cannot be your father&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said she softly; and on affirming that he
      had uttered it and written it, she replied in the same tone, more
      effective than the ordinary language of conviction, &lsquo;He does not think
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The rage of a youth to prove himself in the right of an argument was
      insufficient to make me lay the letter out before other eyes than my own,
      and I shrank from exposing it to compassionate gentle eyes that would have
      pleaded similar allowances to mine for the wildness of the style. I should
      have thanked, but despised the intelligence of one who framed my excuses
      for my father, just as the squire, by abusing him, would have made me a
      desperate partisan in a minute. The vitality of the delusion I cherished
      was therefore partly extinct; not so the love; yet the love of him could
      no longer shake itself free from oppressive shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of his circle of attraction books were my resource.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. MY TWENTY-FIRST BIRTHDAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Books and dreams, like the two rivers cited by my father, flowed side by
      side in me without mixing; and which the bright Rhone was, which the brown
      Arve, needs not to be told to those who know anything of youth; they were
      destined to intermingle soon enough. I read well, for I felt ground and
      had mounting views; the real world, and the mind and passions of the
      world, grew visible to me. My tutor pleased the squire immensely by
      calling me matter-of-fact. In philosophy and history I hated speculation;
      but nothing was too fantastic for my ideas of possible occurrences. Once
      away from books, I carried a head that shot rockets to the farthest hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear friend Temple was at sea, or I should have had one near me to
      detect and control the springs of nonsense. I was deemed a remarkably
      quiet sober thoughtful young man, acquiescent in all schemes projected for
      my welfare. The squire would have liked to see me courting the girl of his
      heart, as he termed Janet Ilchester, a little more demonstratively. We
      had, however, come to the understanding that I was to travel before
      settling. Traditional notions of the importance of the Grand Tour in the
      education of gentlemen led him to consent to my taking a year on the
      Continent accompanied by my tutor. He wanted some one, he said, to
      represent him when I was out over there; which signified that he wanted
      some one to keep my father in check; but as the Rev. Ambrose Peterborough,
      successor to the Rev. Simon Hart, was hazy and manageable, I did not
      object. Such faith had the quiet thoughtful young man at Riversley in the
      convulsions of the future, the whirlwinds and whirlpools spinning for him
      and all connected with him, that he did not object to hear his name and
      Janet&rsquo;s coupled, though he had not a spark of love for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to realize to myself the general opinion that she was handsome.
      Her eyebrows were thick and level and long; her eyes direct in their gaze,
      of a flinty blue, with dark lashes; her nose firm, her lips fullish, firm
      when joined; her shape straight, moderately flexible. But she had no
      softness; she could admire herself in my presence; she claimed possession
      of me openly, and at the same time openly provoked a siege from the
      remainder of my sex: she was not maidenly. She caught imagination by the
      sleeve, and shut it between square whitewashed walls. Heriot thought her
      not only handsome, but comparable to Mrs. William Bulsted, our Julia
      Rippenger of old. At his meeting with Julia, her delicious loss of colour
      made her seem to me one of the loveliest women on earth. Janet never lost
      colour, rarely blushed; she touched neither nerve nor fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You want a rousing coquette,&rsquo; said Heriot; &lsquo;you won&rsquo;t be happy till you
      &lsquo;ve been racked by that nice instrument of torture, and the fair Bulsted
      will do it for you if you like. You don&rsquo;t want a snake or a common
      serpent, you want a Python.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted bloom and mystery, a woman shifting like the light with evening
      and night and dawn, and sudden fire. Janet was bald to the heart
      inhabiting me then, as if quite shaven. She could speak her affectionate
      mind as plain as print, and it was dull print facing me, not the arches of
      the sunset. Julia had only to lisp, &lsquo;my husband,&rsquo; to startle and agitate
      me beyond expression. She said simple things&mdash;&lsquo;I slept well last
      night,&rsquo; or &lsquo;I dreamed,&rsquo; or &lsquo;I shivered,&rsquo; and plunged me headlong down
      impenetrable forests. The mould of her mouth to a reluctant &lsquo;No,&rsquo; and her
      almost invariable drawing in of her breath with a &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; surcharged the
      everyday monosyllables with meanings of life and death. At last I was
      reduced to tell her, seeing that she reproached my coldness for Janet, how
      much I wished Janet resembled her. Her Irish eyes lightened: &lsquo;Me! Harry&rsquo;;
      then they shadowed: &lsquo;She is worth ten of me.&rsquo; Such pathetic humility
      tempted me to exalt her supremely.
    </p>
    <p>
      I talked like a boy, feeling like a man: she behaved like a woman,
      blushing like a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Julia! I can never call you Mrs. Bulsted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have an affection for my husband, have you not, Harry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a season when this was adorable language to me, the indication is
      sufficient. Riding out perfectly crazed by it, I met Kiomi, and
      transferred my emotions. The squire had paid her people an annual sum to
      keep away from our neighbourhood, while there was a chance of my taking to
      gipsy life. They had come back to their old camping-ground, rather
      dissatisfied with the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak to him yourself, Kiomi,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;whatever you ask for, he can&rsquo;t
      refuse anything to such eyes as yours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You!&rsquo; she rallied me; &lsquo;why can&rsquo;t you talk sensible stuff!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had grown a superb savage, proof against weather and compliments. Her
      face was like an Egyptian sky fronting night. The strong old Eastern blood
      put ruddy flame for the red colour; tawny olive edged from the red; rare
      vivid yellow, all but amber. The light that first looks down upon the
      fallen sun was her complexion above the brows, and round the cheeks, the
      neck&rsquo;s nape, the throat, and the firm bosom prompt to lift and sink with
      her vigour of speech, as her eyes were to flash and darken. Meeting her
      you swore she was the personification of wandering Asia. There was no
      question of beauty and grace, for these have laws. The curve of her brows
      broke like a beaten wave; the lips and nostrils were wide, tragic in
      repose. But when she laughed she illuminated you; where she stepped she
      made the earth hers. She was as fresh of her East as the morning when her
      ancient people struck tents in the track of their shadows. I write of her
      in the style consonant to my ideas of her at the time. I would have
      carried her off on the impulse and lived her life, merely to have had such
      a picture moving in my sight, and call it mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not married?&rsquo; I said, ludicrously faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I &lsquo;ve not seen the man I&rsquo;d marry,&rsquo; she answered, grinning scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prizefighter had adopted drinking for his pursuit; one of her aunts
      was dead, and she was in quest of money to bury the dead woman with the
      conventional ceremonies and shows of respect dear to the hearts of
      gipsies, whose sense of propriety and adherence to customs are a sentiment
      indulged by them to a degree unknown to the stabled classes. In fact, they
      have no other which does not come under the definite title of pride;&mdash;pride
      in their physical prowess, their dexterity, ingenuity, and tricksiness,
      and their purity of blood. Kiomi confessed she had hoped to meet me;
      confessed next that she had been waiting to jump out on me: and next that
      she had sat in a tree watching the Grange yesterday for six hours; and all
      for money to do honour to her dead relative, poor little soul! Heriot and
      I joined the decent procession to the grave. Her people had some quarrel
      with the Durstan villagers, and she feared the scandal of being pelted on
      the way to the church. I knew that nothing of the sort would happen if I
      was present. Kiomi walked humbly with her head bent, leaving me the thick
      rippling coarse black locks of her hair for a mark of observation. We were
      entertained at her camp in the afternoon. I saw no sign of intelligence
      between her and Heriot. On my asking her, the day before, if she
      remembered him, she said, &lsquo;I do, I&rsquo;m dangerous for that young man.&rsquo; 
      Heriot&rsquo;s comment on her was impressed on me by his choosing to call her &lsquo;a
      fine doe leopard,&rsquo; and maintaining that it was a defensible phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was swept from my amorous mind by Mabel Sweetwinter, the miller&rsquo;s
      daughter of Dipwell. This was a Saxon beauty in full bud, yellow as
      mid-May, with the eyes of opening June. Beauty, you will say, is easily
      painted in that style. But the sort of beauty suits the style, and the
      well-worn comparisons express the well-known type. Beside Kiomi she was
      like a rich meadow on the border of the heaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      We saw them together on my twenty-first birthday. To my shame I awoke in
      the early morning at Riversley, forgetful of my father&rsquo;s old appointment
      for the great Dipwell feast. Not long after sunrise, when blackbirds peck
      the lawns, and swallows are out from under eaves to the flood&rsquo;s face, I
      was hailed by Janet Ilchester beneath my open windows. I knew she had a
      bet with the squire that she would be the first to hail me legal man, and
      was prepared for it. She sat on horseback alone in the hazy dewy Midsummer
      morning, giving clear note:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whoop! Harry Richmond! halloo!&rsquo; To which I tossed her a fox&rsquo;s brush,
      having a jewelled bracelet pendant. She missed it and let it lie, and
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; it&rsquo;s foxie himself!&mdash;anybody may have the brush. You&rsquo;re
      dressed, are you, Harry? You were sure I should come? A thousand happy
      years to you, and me to see them, if you don&rsquo;t mind. I &lsquo;m first to wish
      it, I&rsquo;m certain. I was awake at three, out at halfpast, over Durstan
      heath, across Eckerthy&rsquo;s fields&mdash;we&rsquo;ll pay the old man for damage&mdash;down
      by the plantation, Bran and Sailor at my heels, and here I am. Crow,
      cocks! bark, dogs! up, larks! I said I&rsquo;d be first. And now I &lsquo;m round to
      stables to stir up Uberly. Don&rsquo;t be tardy, Mr. Harry, and we&rsquo;ll be
      Commodore Arson and his crew before the world&rsquo;s awake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We rode out for a couple of hours, and had to knock at a farmhouse for
      milk and bread. Possibly a sense of independence, owing to the snatching
      of a meal in midflight away from home, made Janet exclaim that she would
      gladly be out all day. Such freaks were exceedingly to my taste. Then I
      remembered Dipwell, and sure that my father would be there, though he had
      not written of it, I proposed to ride over. She pleaded for the horses and
      the squire alternately. Feasting was arranged at Riversley, as well as at
      Dipwell, and she said musically,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harry, the squire is a very old man, and you may not have many more
      chances of pleasing him. To-day do, do! To-morrow, ride to your father, if
      you must: of course you must if you think it right; but don&rsquo;t go this
      day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not upset my fortune, Janet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt the kind old man&rsquo;s heart to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! you&rsquo;re the girl of his heart, I know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Harry, you have first place, and I want you to keep it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But here&rsquo;s an oath I&rsquo;ve sworn to my father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He should not have exacted it, I think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I promised him when I was a youngster.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then be wiser now, Harry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have brilliant ideas of the sacredness of engagements.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I have common sense, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is a matter of feeling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems that you forgot it, though!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Kiomi&rsquo;s tents on Durstan heath rose into view. I controlled my verbal
      retort upon Janet to lead her up to the gipsy girl, for whom she had an
      odd aversion, dating from childhood. Kiomi undertook to ride to Dipwell, a
      distance of thirty miles, and carry the message that I would be there by
      nightfall. Tears were on Janet&rsquo;s resolute face as we cantered home.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast the squire introduced me to his lawyer, Mr. Burgin, who,
      closeted alone with me, said formally,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Harry Richmond, you are Squire Beltham&rsquo;s grandson, his sole male
      descendant, and you are established at present, and as far as we can
      apprehend for the future, as the direct heir to the whole of his property,
      which is enormous now, and likely to increase so long as he lives. You may
      not be aware that your grandfather has a most sagacious eye for business.
      Had he not been born a rich man he would still have been one of our very
      greatest millionaires. He has rarely invested but to double his capital;
      never speculated but to succeed. He may not understand men quite so well,
      but then he trusts none entirely; so if there is a chasm in his
      intelligence, there is a bridge thrown across it. The metaphor is obscure
      perhaps: you will doubtless see my meaning. He knows how to go on his road
      without being cheated. For himself, your grandfather, Mr. Harry, is the
      soul of honour. Now, I have to explain certain family matters. The
      squire&rsquo;s wife, your maternal grandmother, was a rich heiress. Part of her
      money was settled on her to descend to her children by reversion upon her
      death. What she herself possessed she bequeathed to them in reversion
      likewise to their children. Thus at your maternal grandmother&rsquo;s death,
      your mother and your aunt inherited money to use as their own, and the
      interest of money tied fast in reversion to their children (in case of
      marriage) after their death. Your grandfather, as your natural guardian,
      has left the annual interest of your money to accumulate, and now you are
      of age he hands it to you, as you see, without much delay. Thus you become
      this day the possessor of seventy thousand pounds, respecting the disposal
      of which I am here to take your orders. Ahem!&mdash;as to the remaining
      property of your mother&rsquo;s&mdash;the sum held by her for her own use, I
      mean, it devolved to her husband, your father, who, it is probable, will
      furnish you an account of it&mdash;ah!&mdash;at his leisure&mdash;ah! um!
      And now, in addition, Mr. Harry, I have the squire&rsquo;s commands to speak to
      you as a man of business, on what may be deemed a delicate subject, though
      from the business point of view no peculiar delicacy should pertain to it.
      Your grandfather will settle on you estates and money to the value of
      twenty thousand pounds per annum on the day of your union with a young
      lady in this district, Miss Janet Ilchester. He undertakes likewise to
      provide her pin-money. Also, let me observe, that it is his request&mdash;but
      he makes no stipulation of it that you will ultimately assume the name of
      Beltham, subscribing yourself Harry Lepel Richmond Beltham; or, if it
      pleases you, Richmond-Beltham, with the junction hyphen. Needless to say,
      he leaves it to your decision. And now, Mr. Harry, I have done, and may
      most cordially congratulate you on the blessings it has pleased a kind and
      discerning Providence to shower on your head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      None so grimly ironical as the obsequious! I thought of Burgin&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;discerning&rsquo; providence (he spoke with all professional sincerity) in
      after days.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the occasion I thought of nothing but the squire&rsquo;s
      straight-forwardness, and grieved to have to wound him. Janet helped me.
      She hinted with a bashfulness, quite new to her, that I must go through
      some ceremony. Guessing what it was, I saluted her on the cheek. The
      squire observed that a kiss of that sort might as well have been planted
      on her back hair. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; said he, and wisely, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather have the girl
      worth ten of you, than you be more than her match. Girls like my girl here
      are precious.&rsquo; Owing to her intercession, he winked at my departure after
      I had done duty among the tenants; he barely betrayed his vexation, and it
      must have been excessive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heriot and I rode over to Dipwell. Next night we rode back by moonlight
      with matter for a year of laughter, singing like two Arabian poets praises
      of dark and fair, challengeing one to rival the other. Kiomi! Mabel! we
      shouted separately. We had just seen the dregs of the last of the birthday
      Burgundy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kiomi! what a splendid panther she is!&rsquo; cries Heriot; and I: &lsquo;Teeth and
      claws, and a skin like a burnt patch on a common! Mabel&rsquo;s like a wonderful
      sunflower.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Butter and eggs! old Richie, and about as much fire as a rushlight. If
      the race were Fat she &lsquo;d beat the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heriot, I give you my word of honour, the very look of her &lsquo;s eternal
      Summer. Kiomi rings thin&mdash;she tinkles; it &lsquo;s the difference between
      metal and flesh.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did she tinkle, as you call it, when that fellow Destrier, confound him!
      touched her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The little cat! Did you notice Mabel&rsquo;s blush?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How could I help it? We&rsquo;ve all had a dozen apiece. You saw little Kiomi
      curled up under the hop and briony?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I took her for a dead jackdaw.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I took her for what she is, and she may slap, scream, tear, and bite, I
      &lsquo;ll take her yet-and all her tribe crying thief, by way of a diversion.
      She and I are footed a pair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His impetuosity surpassed mine so much that I fell to brooding on the
      superior image of my charmer. The result was, I could not keep away from
      her. I managed to get home with leaden limbs. Next day I was back at
      Dipwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such guilt as I have to answer for I may avow. I made violent love to this
      silly country beauty, and held every advantage over her other flatterers.
      She had met me on the evening of the great twenty-first, she and a line of
      damsels dressed in white and wearing wreaths, and I had claimed the
      privilege of saluting her. The chief superintendent of the festivities, my
      father&rsquo;s old cook, Monsieur Alphonse, turned twilight into noonday with a
      sheaf of rockets at the moment my lips brushed her cheek. It was a kiss
      marred; I claimed to amend it. Besides, we had been bosom friends in
      childhood. My wonder at the growth of the rose I had left but an
      insignificant thorny shoot was exquisite natural flattery, sweet reason,
      to which she could not say nonsense. At each step we trod on souvenirs,
      innocent in themselves, had they recurred to childish minds. The whisper,
      &lsquo;Hark! it&rsquo;s sunset, Mabel, Martha Thresher calls,&rsquo; clouded her face with
      stormy sunset colours. I respected Martha even then for boldly speaking to
      me on the girl&rsquo;s behalf. Mrs. Waddy&rsquo;s courage failed. John Thresher and
      Mark Sweetwinter were overcome by my father&rsquo;s princely prodigality; their
      heads were turned, they appeared to have assumed that I could do no wrong.
      To cut short the episode, some one wrote to the squire in uncouth English,
      telling him I was courting a country lass, and he at once started me for
      the Continent. We had some conversation on money before parting. The
      squire allowed me a thousand a year, independent of my own income. He
      counselled prudence, warned me that I was on my trial, and giving me his
      word of honour that he should not spy into my Bank accounts, desired me to
      be worthy of the trust reposed in me. Speculation he forbade. I left him
      satisfied with the assurance that I meant to make my grand tour neither as
      a merchant, a gambler, nor a rake, but simply as a plain English
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing better in the world than that,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived in London, I left my travelling companion, the Rev. Ambrose
      Peterborough, sipping his Port at the hotel, and rushed down to Dipwell,
      shot a pebble at Mabel&rsquo;s window by morning twilight, and soon had her face
      at the casement. But it was a cloudy and rainbeaten face. She pointed
      toward the farm, saying that my father was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has he grieved you, Mabel?&rsquo; I asked softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no, not he! he wouldn&rsquo;t, he couldn&rsquo;t; he talked right. Oh, go, go:
      for I haven&rsquo;t a foot to move. And don&rsquo;t speak so soft; I can&rsquo;t bear
      kindness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father in admonishing her had done it tenderly, I was sure. Tenderness
      was the weapon which had wounded her, and so she shrank from it; and if I
      had reproached and abused her she might, perhaps, have obeyed me by coming
      out, not to return. She was deaf. I kissed my hand to her regretfully; a
      condition of spirit gradually dissolved by the haunting phantom of her
      forehead and mouth crumpling up for fresh floods of tears. Had she
      concealed that vision with her handkerchief, I might have waited to see
      her before I saw my father. He soon changed the set of the current.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our little Mabel here,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;is an inflammable puss, I fear. By the
      way, talking of girls, I have a surprise for you. Remind me of it when we
      touch Ostend. We may want a yacht there to entertain high company. I have
      set inquiries afloat for the hire of a schooner. This child Mabel can read
      and write, I suppose? Best write no letters, boy. Do not make old Dipwell
      a thorny bed. I have a portrait to show you, Richie. A portrait! I think
      you will say the original was worthy of more than to be taken up and
      thrown away like a weed. You see, Richie, girls have only one chance in
      the world, and good God! to ruin that&mdash;no, no. You shall see this
      portrait. A pretty little cow-like Mabel, I grant you. But to have her on
      the conscience! What a coronet to wear! My young Lord Destrier&mdash;you
      will remember him as one of our guests here; I brought him to make your
      acquaintance; well, he would not be scrupulous, it is possible. Ay, but
      compare yourself with him, Richie! and you and I, let us love one another
      and have no nettles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He flourished me away to London, into new spheres of fancy. He was
      irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a London Club I was led up to the miniature of a youthful woman,
      singular for her endearing beauty Her cheeks were merry red, her lips
      lively with the spark of laughter, her eyes in good union with them,
      showing you the laughter was gentle; eyes of overflowing blue light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is she?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old-fashioned building of the powdered hair counselled me to add, &lsquo;Who
      was she?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain DeWitt, though a member of the Club, seemed unable to inform me.
      His glance consulted my father. He hummed and drawled, and said: &lsquo;Mistress
      Anastasia Dewsbury; that was her name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She does not look a grandmother,&rsquo; said my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She would be one by this time, I dare say,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      We gazed in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; he sighed. &lsquo;She was a charming actress, and one of the best of
      women. A noble-minded young woman! A woman of cultivation and genius! Do
      you see a broken heart in that face? No? Very well. A walk will take us to
      her grave. She died early.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was breathing &lsquo;Who?&rsquo; when he said, &lsquo;She was my mother, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was piteous.
    </p>
    <p>
      We walked to an old worn flat stone in a London street, where under I had
      to imagine those features of beautiful humanity lying shut from us.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had suffered in life miserably.

      CHAPTER XXIV. I MEET THE PRINCESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hearing that I had not slept at the hotel, the Rev. Ambrose rushed down to
      Riversley with melancholy ejaculations, and was made to rebound by the
      squire&rsquo;s contemptuous recommendation to him to learn to know something of
      the spirit of young bloods, seeing that he had the nominal charge of one,
      and to preach his sermon in secret, if he would be sermonizing out of
      church. The good gentleman had not exactly understood his duties, or how
      to conduct them. Far from objecting to find me in company with my father,
      as he would otherwise have done by transmitting information of that fact
      to Riversley, he now congratulated himself on it, and after the two had
      conversed apart, cordially agreed to our scheme of travelling together.
      The squire had sickened him. I believe that by comparison he saw in my
      father a better friend of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall not be the worse for a ghostly adviser at hand,&rsquo; my father said
      to me with his quaintest air of gravity and humour mixed, which was not
      insincerely grave, for the humour was unconscious. &lsquo;An accredited casuist
      may frequently be a treasure. And I avow it, I like to travel with my
      private chaplain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Peterborough&rsquo;s temporary absence had allowed me time for getting ample
      funds placed at our disposal through the agency of my father&rsquo;s solicitors,
      Messrs. Dettermain and Newson, whom I already knew from certain
      transactions with them on his behalf. They were profoundly courteous to
      me, and showed me his box, and alluded to his Case&mdash;a long one, and a
      lamentable, I was taught to apprehend, by their lugubriously professional
      tone about it. The question was naturally prompted in me, &lsquo;Why do you not
      go on with it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Want of funds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no necessity to name that now,&rsquo; I insisted. But my father desired
      them to postpone any further exposition of the case, saying, &lsquo;Pleasure
      first, business by-and-by. That, I take it, is in the order of our great
      mother Nature, gentlemen. I will not have him help shoulder his father&rsquo;s
      pack until he has had his, fill of entertainment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A smooth voyage brought us in view of the towers of Ostend at sunrise.
      Standing with my father on deck, and gazing on this fringe of the grand
      romantic Continent, I remembered our old travels, and felt myself bound to
      him indissolubly, ashamed of my recent critical probings of his character.
      My boy&rsquo;s love for him returned in full force. I was sufficiently cognizant
      of his history to know that he kept his head erect, lighted by the fire of
      his robust heart in the thick of overhanging natal clouds. As the way is
      with men when they are too happy to be sentimental, I chattered of
      anything but my feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a capital idea that was of yours to bring down old Alphonse to
      Dipwell! You should have heard old John Thresher and Mark Sweetwinter and
      the others grumbling at the interference of &ldquo;French frogs;&rdquo; with their
      beef, though Alphonse vowed he only ordered the ox to be turned faster,
      and he dressed their potatoes in six different ways. I doubt if Dipwell
      has composed itself yet. You know I sat for president in their tent while
      the beef went its first round; and Alphonse was in an awful hurry to drag
      me into what he called the royal tent. By the way, you should have hauled
      the standard down at sunset.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not when the son had not come down among us,&rsquo; said my father, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I forgot to tell you about Alphonse. By the way, we&rsquo;ll have him in
      our service. There was he plucking at me: &ldquo;Monsieur Henri-Richie, Monsieur
      Henri-Richie! mille complimens... et les potages, Monsieur!&mdash;a la
      Camerani, a la tortue, aux petits pois... c&rsquo;est en vrai artiste que j&rsquo;ai
      su tout retarder jusqu&rsquo;au dernier moment.... Monsieur! cher Monsieur
      Henri-Richie, je vous en supplie, laissez-la, ces planteurs de choux.&rdquo; And
      John Thresher, as spokesman for the rest: &ldquo;Master Harry, we beg to say, in
      my name, we can&rsquo;t masticate comfortably while we&rsquo;ve got a notion Mr.
      Frenchman he &lsquo;s present here to play his Frenchified tricks with our plain
      wholesome dishes. Our opinion is, he don&rsquo;t know beef from hedgehog; and
      let him trim &lsquo;em, and egg &lsquo;em,&rsquo; and bread-crumb &lsquo;em, and pound the mess
      all his might, and then tak&rsquo; and roll &lsquo;em into balls, we say we wun&rsquo;t, for
      we can&rsquo;t make English muscle out o&rsquo; that.&rdquo;&mdash;And Alphonse, quite
      indifferent to the vulgar: &ldquo;He! mais pensez donc au Papa, Monsieur
      Henri-Richie, sans doute il a une sante de fer: mais encore faut-il lui
      menager le suc gastrique, pancreatique....&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, ay!&rsquo; laughed my father; &lsquo;what sets you thinking of Alphonse?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose because I shall have to be speaking French in an hour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;German, Richie, German.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But these Belgians speak French.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Such French as it is. You will, however, be engaged in a German
      conversation first, I suspect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll stumble on. I don&rsquo;t much like it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In six hours from this second of time, Richie, boy, I undertake to
      warrant you fonder of the German tongue than of any other spoken
      language.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at him. He gave me a broad pleasant smile, without sign of a jest
      lurking in one corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene attracted me. Laughing fishwife faces radiant with sea-bloom in
      among the weedy pier-piles, and sombre blue-cheeked officers of the
      douane, with their double row of buttons extending the breadth of their
      shoulders. My father won Mr. Peterborough&rsquo;s approval by declaring cigars
      which he might easily have passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now, sir,&rsquo;&mdash;he used the commanding unction of a lady&rsquo;s doctor,&mdash;&lsquo;you
      to bed, and a short repose. We will, if it pleases you, breakfast at
      eight. I have a surprise for Mr. Richie. We are about to beat the drum in
      the market-place, and sing out for echoes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, sir?&rsquo; said the simple man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I promise you we shall not disturb you, Mr. Peterborough. You have
      reached that middle age, have you not, when sleep is, so to put it, your
      capital? And your activity is the interest you draw from it to live on.
      You have three good hours. So, then, till we meet at the breakfast-table.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father&rsquo;s first proceeding at the hotel was to examine the list of
      visitors. He questioned one of the waiters aside, took information from
      him, and seized my arm rather tremulously, saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are here. &lsquo;Tis as I expected. And she is taking the morning breath
      of sea-air on the dunes. Come, Richie, come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s the &ldquo;she&rdquo;?&rsquo; I asked incuriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, she is young, she is of high birth, she is charming. We have a
      crowned head or two here. I observe in you, Richie, an extraordinary
      deficiency of memory. She has had an illness; Neptune speed her recovery!
      Now for a turn at our German. Die Strassen ruhen; die Stadt schlaft; aber
      dort, siehst Du, dort liegt das blaue Meer, das nimmer-schlafende! She is
      gazing on it, and breathing it, Richie. Ach! ihr jauchzende Seejungfern.
      On my soul, I expect to see the very loveliest of her sex!
    </p>
    <p>
      You must not be dismayed at pale cheeks-blasse Wangen. Her illness has
      been alarming. Why, this air is the top of life; it will, and it shall,
      revive her. How will she address him?&mdash;&ldquo;Freund,&rdquo; in my presence,
      perchance: she has her invalid&rsquo;s privilege. &ldquo;Theure Prinzessin&rdquo; you might
      venture on. No ice! Ay, there she is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Solitary, on the long level of the sand-bank, I perceived a group that
      became discernible as three persons attached to an invalid&rsquo;s chair, moving
      leisurely toward us. I was in the state of mind between divination and
      doubt when the riddle is not impossible to read, would but the heart cease
      its hurry an instant; a tumbled sky where the break is coming. It came.
      The dear old days of my wanderings with Temple framed her face. I knew her
      without need of pause or retrospect. The crocus raising its cup pointed as
      when it pierced the earth, and the crocus stretched out on earth, wounded
      by frost, is the same flower. The face was the same, though the features
      were changed. Unaltered in expression, but wan, and the kind blue eyes
      large upon lean brows, her aspect was that of one who had been half caught
      away and still shook faintly in the relaxing invisible grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stopped at a distance of half-a-dozen paces to allow her time for
      recollection. She eyed us softly in a fixed manner, while the sea-wind
      blew her thick redbrown hair to threads on her cheek. Colour on the fair
      skin told us we were recognized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Princess Ottilia!&rsquo; said my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is I, my friend,&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;And you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With more health than I am in need of, dearest princess.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harry Richmond! my son, now of age, commencing his tour; and he has not
      forgotten the farewell bunch of violets.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyelids gently lifted, asking me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor the mount you did me the honour to give me on the little Hungarian,&rsquo; 
      said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How nice this sea-air is!&rsquo; she spoke in English. &lsquo;England and sea go
      together in my thoughts. And you are here! I have been down very low, near
      the lowest. But your good old sea makes me breathe again. I want to toss
      on it. Have you yet seen the Markgrafin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father explained that we had just landed from the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is our meeting, then, an accident?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear princess, I heard of your being out by the shore.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! kind: and you walked to meet me? I love that as well, though I love
      chance. And it is chance that brings you here! I looked out on the boat
      from England while they were dressing me: I cannot have too much of the
      morning, for then I have all to myself: sea and sky and I. The night
      people are all asleep, and you come like an old Marchen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyelids dropped without closing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak no more to her just at present,&rsquo; said an English voice, Miss
      Silbey&rsquo;s. Schwartz, the huge dragoon, whose big black horse hung near him
      in my memory like a phantom, pulled the chair at a quiet pace, head
      downward. A young girl clad in plain black walked beside Miss Sibley,
      following the wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Danger is over,&rsquo; Miss Sibley answered my gaze. &lsquo;She is convalescent. You
      see how weak she is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I praised the lady for what I deemed her great merit in not having quitted
      the service of the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;my adieux to Sarkeld were uttered years ago. But when I
      heard of her fall from the horse I went and nursed her. We were once in
      dread of her leaving us. She sank as if she had taken some internal
      injury. It may have been only the shock to her system and the cessation of
      her accustomed exercise. She has a little over-studied.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The margravine?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The margravine is really very good and affectionate, and has won my
      esteem. So you and your father are united at last? We have often talked of
      you. Oh! that day up by the tower. But, do you know, the statue is
      positively there now, and no one&mdash;no one who had the privilege of
      beholding the first bronze Albrecht Wohlgemuth, Furst von
      Eppenwelzen-Sarkeld, no one will admit that the second is half worthy of
      him. I can feel to this day the leap of the heart in my mouth when the
      statue dismounted. The prince sulked for a month: the margravine still
      longer at your father&rsquo;s evasion. She could not make allowance for the
      impulsive man: such a father; such a son!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, thank you most humbly,&rsquo; said I, bowing to her shadow of a mock
      curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess&rsquo;s hand appeared at a side of the chair. We hastened to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me laugh, too,&rsquo; she prayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Sibley was about to reply, but stared, and delight sprang to her lips
      in a quick cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What medicine is this? Why, the light of morning has come to you, my
      darling!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am better, dearest, better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You sigh, my own.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; I breathe lots, lots of salt air now, and lift like a boat. Ask him&mdash;he
      had a little friend, much shorter than himself, who came the whole way
      with him out of true friendship&mdash;ask him where is the friend?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Sibley turned her head to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Temple,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;Temple is a midshipman; he is at sea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is something to think of,&rsquo; the princess murmured, and dropped her
      eyelids a moment. She resumed &lsquo;The Grand Seigneur was at Vienna last year,
      and would not come to Sarkeld, though he knew I was ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father stooped low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Grand Seigneur, your servant, dear princess, was an Ottoman Turk, and
      his Grand Vizier advised him to send flowers in his place weekly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had them, and when we could get those flowers nowhere else,&rsquo; she
      replied. &lsquo;So it was you! So my friends have been about me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      During the remainder of the walk I was on one side of the chair, and her
      little maid on the other, while my father to rearward conversed with Miss
      Sibley. The princess took a pleasure in telling me that this Aennchen of
      hers knew me well, and had known me before ever her mistress had seen me.
      Aennchen was the eldest of the two children Temple and I had eaten
      breakfast with in the forester&rsquo;s hut. I felt myself as if in the forest
      again, merely wondering at the growth of the trees, and the narrowness of
      my vision in those days.
    </p>
    <p>
      At parting, the princess said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is my English improved? You smiled at it once. I will ask you when I meet
      you next.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is my question,&rsquo; I whispered to my own ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you say&mdash;&ldquo;It is my question&rdquo;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was constrained to remind her of her old forms of English speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You remember that? Adieu,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father considerately left me to carry on my promenade alone. I crossed
      the ground she had traversed, noting every feature surrounding it, the
      curving wheel-track, the thin prickly sand-herbage, the wave-mounds, the
      sparse wet shells and pebbles, the gleaming flatness of the water, and the
      vast horizon-boundary of pale flat land level with shore, looking like a
      dead sister of the sea. By a careful examination of my watch and the sun&rsquo;s
      altitude, I was able to calculate what would, in all likelihood, have been
      his height above yonder waves when her chair was turned toward the city,
      at a point I reached in the track. But of the matter then simultaneously
      occupying my mind, to recover which was the second supreme task I proposed
      to myself-of what. I also was thinking upon the stroke of five o&rsquo;clock, I
      could recollect nothing. I could not even recollect whether I happened to
      be looking on sun and waves when she must have had them full and glorious
      in her face.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. ON BOARD A YACHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      With the heartiest consent I could give, and a blank cheque, my father
      returned to England to hire forthwith a commodious yacht, fitted and
      manned. Before going he discoursed of prudence in our expenditure; though
      not for the sake of the mere money in hand, which was a trifle, barely
      more than the half of my future income; but that the squire, should he by
      and by bethink him of inspecting our affairs, might perceive we were not
      spendthrifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I promised you a surprise, Richie,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and you have had it;
      whether at all equal to your expectations is for you to determine. I was
      aware of the margravine&rsquo;s intention to bring the princess to these
      sea-sands; they are famous on the Continent. It was bruited last Winter
      and Spring that she would be here in the season for bathing; so I held it
      likely we should meet. We have, you behold. In point of fact, we owe the
      good margravine some show of hospitality. The princess has a passion for
      tossing on the sea. To her a yacht is a thing dropped from the moon. His
      Highness the prince her father could as soon present her with one as with
      the moon itself. The illustrious Serenity&rsquo;s revenue is absorbed, my boy,
      in the state he has to support. As for his daughter&rsquo;s dowry, the young
      gentleman who anticipates getting one with her, I commend to the practise
      of his whistling. It will be among the sums you may count, if you are a
      moderate arithmetician, in groschen. The margravine&rsquo;s income I should
      reckon to approach twenty thousand per annum, and she proves her
      honourable sense that she holds it in trust for others by dispersing it
      rapidly. I fear she loves cards. So, then, I shall go and hire the yacht
      through Dettermain and Newson, furnish it with piano and swing-cot, etc.;
      and if the ladies shrink from a cruise they can have an occasional sail.
      Here are we at their service. I shall be seriously baffled by fortune if I
      am not back to you at the end of a week. You will take your early morning
      walk, I presume. On Sunday see that our chaplain, the excellent Mr.
      Peterborough, officiates for the assembled Protestants of all nations. It
      excites our English enthusiasm. In addition, son Richie, it is peculiarly
      our duty. I, at least, hold the view that it is a family duty. Think it
      over, Richie boy. Providence, you see, has sent us the man. As for me, I
      feel as if I were in the dawn of one life with all the mature experience
      of another. I am calm, I am perfectly unexcited, and I tell you, old son,
      I believe&mdash;pick among the highest&mdash;our destinies are about the
      most brilliant of any couple in Great Britain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His absence relieved me in spite of my renewed pleasure in his talk; I may
      call it a thirsty craving to have him inflating me, puffing the deep
      unillumined treasure-pits of my nature with laborious hints, as mines are
      filled with air to keep the miners going. While he talked he made these
      inmost recesses habitable. But the pain lay in my having now and then to
      utter replies. The task of speaking was hateful. I found a sweetness in
      brooding unrealizingly over hopes and dreams and possibilities, and I let
      him go gladly that I might enjoy a week of silence, just taking
      impressions as they came, like the sands in the ebb-tide. The impression
      of the morning was always enough for a day&rsquo;s meditation. The green colour
      and the crimson athwart it, and higher up the pinky lights, flamingo
      feathers, on a warm half-circle of heaven, in hue between amethyst and
      milky opal; then the rim of the sun&rsquo;s disc not yet severe; and then the
      monstrous shadow of tall Schwartz darting at me along the sand, then the
      princess. This picture, seen at sunrise, lasted till I slept. It stirred
      no thoughts, conjured no images, it possessed me. In the afternoon the
      margravine accompanied the princess to a point facing seaward, within
      hearing of the military band. She did me the favour to tell me that she
      tolerated me until I should become efficient in German to amuse her, but
      the dulness of the Belgian city compared with her lively German
      watering-places compelled her to try my powers of fun in French, and in
      French I had to do duty, and failed in my office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;that your honourable papa is one in a million?
      He has the life of a regiment in his ten fingers. What astonishes me is
      that he does not make fury in that England of yours&mdash;that Lapland! Je
      ne puffs me passer de cet homme! He offends me, he trifles, he outrages,
      he dares permit himself to be indignant. Bon! we part, and absence pleads
      for him with the eloquence of Satan. I am his victim. Does he, then,
      produce no stir whatever in your England? But what a people! But yes, you
      resemble us, as bottles&mdash;bottles; seulement, you are emptied of your
      wine. Ce Monsieur Peterbooroo&rsquo;! Il m&rsquo;agace les nerfs. It cannot be blood
      in his veins. One longs to see him cuffed, to see if he has the English
      lion in him, one knows not where. But you are so, you English, when not
      intoxicated. And so censorious! You win your battles, they say, upon beer
      and cordials: it is why you never can follow up a success. Je tiens cela
      du Marechal Prince B&mdash;&mdash;-. Let that pass. One groans at your
      intolerable tristesse. La vie en Angleterre est comme un marais. It is a
      scandal to human nature. It blows fogs, foul vapours, joint-stiffnesses,
      agues, pestilences, over us here,&mdash;yes, here! That is your best side:
      but your worst is too atrocious! Mon Dieu! Your men-rascals! Your
      women-rascals!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good soul!&rsquo; the princess arrested her, &lsquo;I beg that you will not abuse
      England.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have I abused England?&rsquo; exclaimed the margravine. &lsquo;Nay, then, it was
      because England is shockingly unjust to the most amusing, the most
      reviving, charming of men. There is he fresh as a green bubbling well, and
      those English decline to do honour to his source. Now tell me, you!&rsquo; She
      addressed me imperiously. &lsquo;Are you prosecuting his claims? Are you
      besieging your Government? What! you are in the season of generosity, an
      affectionate son, wealthy as a Magyar prince of flocks, herds, mines, and
      men, and you let him stand in the shade deprived of his birthright? Are
      you a purse-proud commoner or an imbecile?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My whimsy aunt!&rsquo; the princess interposed again, &lsquo;now you have taken to
      abusing a defenceless Englishman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing of the sort, child. I compliment him on his looks and manners; he
      is the only one of his race who does not appear to have marched out of a
      sentinel&rsquo;s box with a pocket-mirror in his hand. I thank him from my soul
      for not cultivating the national cat&rsquo;s whisker. None can imagine what I
      suffer from the oppressive sight of his Monsieur Peterbooroo&rsquo;! And they
      are of one pattern&mdash;the entire nation! He! no, he has the step of a
      trained blood-horse. Only, as Kaunitz, or somebody, said of Joseph II., or
      somebody, he thinks or he chews. Englishmen&rsquo;s mouths were clearly not made
      for more purposes than one. In truth, I am so utterly wearied, I could
      pray for the diversion of a descent of rain. The life here is as bad as in
      Rippau. I might just as well be in Rippau doing duty: the silly people
      complain, I hear. I am gathering dust. These, my dear, these are the
      experiences which age women at a prodigious rate. I feel chains on my
      limbs here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madame, I would,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;that I were the Perseus to relieve you of your
      monster Ennui, but he is coming quickly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see he has his pretty phrases!&rsquo; cried the margravine; adding
      encouragingly, &lsquo;S&rsquo;il nest pas tant sort peu impertinent?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The advance of some German or Russian nobleman spared me further efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were on shore, listening to the band in the afternoon, when a sail like
      a spark of pure white stood on the purple black edge of a storm-cloud. It
      was the yacht. By sunset it was moored off shore, and at night hung with
      variegated lamps. Early next morning we went on board. The ladies were
      astonished at the extent of the vessel, and its luxurious fittings and
      cunning arrangements. My father, in fact, had negotiated for the hire of
      the yacht some weeks previously, with his accustomed forethought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;House and town and fortress provisioned, and moveable at will!&rsquo; the
      margravine interjected repeatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess was laid on raised pillows in her swingcot under an awning
      aft, and watched the sailors, the splendid offspring of old sea-fights, as
      I could observe her spirited fancy conceiving them. They were a set of men
      to point to for an answer to the margravine&rsquo;s strictures on things
      English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, are you the captain, my good Herr Heilbrunn?&rsquo; the margravine asked
      my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was dressed in cheerful blue, wearing his cheerfullest air, and seemed
      strongly inclined for the part of captain, but presented the actual
      commander of the schooner-yacht, and helped him through the margravine&rsquo;s
      interrogations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All is excellent,&mdash;excellent for a day&rsquo;s sail,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I have no
      doubt you could nourish my system for a month, but to deal frankly with
      you&mdash;prepared meats and cold pies!&mdash;to face them once is as much
      as I am capable of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Lady Field-Marshal,&rsquo; returned my father, &lsquo;the sons of Neptune would
      be of poor account, if they could not furnish you cookery at sea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They did, for Alphonse was on board. He and my father had a hot discussion
      about the margravine&rsquo;s dishes, Alphonse declaring that it was against his
      conscience to season them pungently, and my father preaching expediency.
      Alphonse spoke of the artist and his duty to his art, my father of the
      wise diplomatist who manipulated individuals without any sacrifice of
      principle. They were partly at play, of course, both having humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It ended in the margravine&rsquo;s being enraptured. The delicacy of the
      invalid&rsquo;s dishes, was beyond praise. &lsquo;So, then, we are absolutely better
      housed and accommodated than on shore!&rsquo; the margravine made her wonder
      heard, and from that fell to enthusiasm for the vessel. After a couple of
      pleasant smooth-sailing days, she consented to cruise off the coasts of
      France and England. Adieu to the sands. Throughout the cruise she was
      placable, satisfied with earth and sea, and constantly eulogizing herself
      for this novel state of serenity. Cards, and a collection of tripping
      French books bound in yellow, danced the gavotte with time, which made the
      flying minutes endurable to her: and for relaxation there was here the
      view of a shining town dropped between green hills to dip in sea-water,
      yonder a ship of merchandise or war to speculate upon, trawlers,
      collier-brigs, sea-birds, wave over wave. No cloud on sun and moon. We had
      gold and silver in our track, like the believable children of fairyland.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess, lying in her hammock-cot on deck, both day and night, or for
      the greater part of the night, let her eyes feast incessantly on a
      laughing sea: when she turned them to any of us, pure pleasure sparkled in
      them. The breezy salt hours were visible ecstasy to her blood. If she
      spoke it was but to utter a few hurried, happy words, and shrink as you
      see the lightning behind a cloud-rack, suggestive of fiery swift emotion
      within, and she gazed away overjoyed at the swoop and plunge of the
      gannet, the sunny spray, the waves curling crested or down-like. At night
      a couple of sailors, tender as women, moved her in the cot to her cabin.
      We heard her voice in the dark of the morning, and her little maid
      Aennchen came out and was met by me; and I at that hour had the privilege
      to help move her back to her favourite place, and strap the iron-stand
      fast, giving the warm-hooded cot room to swing. The keen sensations of a
      return to health amid unwonted scenes made things magical to her. When she
      beheld our low green Devon hills she signalled for help to rise, and &lsquo;That
      is England!&rsquo; she said, summoning to her beautiful clear eyeballs the
      recollection of her first desire to see my country. Her petition was that
      the yacht should go in nearer and nearer to the land till she could
      discern men, women, and children, and their occupations. A fisherman and
      his wife sat in the porch above their hanging garden, the woman knitting,
      the man mending his nets, barefooted boys and girls astride the keel of a
      boat below them. The princess eyed them and wept. &lsquo;They give me happiness;
      I can give them nothing,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The margravine groaned impatiently at talk of such a dieaway sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father sent a couple of men on shore with a gift of money to their
      family in the name of the Princess Ottilia. How she thanked him for his
      prompt ideas! &lsquo;It is because you are generous you read one well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had never thanked me. I craved for that vibrating music as of her deep
      heart penetrated and thrilling, but shrank from grateful words which would
      have sounded payment. Running before the wind swiftly on a night of
      phosphorescent sea, when the waves opened to white hollows with frayed
      white ridges, wreaths of hissing silver, her eyelids closed, and her hand
      wandered over the silken coverlet to the hammock cloth, and up, in a blind
      effort to touch. Mine joined to it. Little Aennchen was witness. Ottilia
      held me softly till her slumber was deep.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. IN VIEW OF THE HOHENZOLLERN&rsquo;S BIRTHPLACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our cruise came to an end in time to save the margravine from yawning. The
      last day of it was windless, and we hung in sight of the colourless low
      Flemish coast for hours, my father tasking his ingenuity to amuse her. He
      sang with Miss Sibley, rallied Mr. Peterborough, played picquet to lose,
      threw over the lead line to count the fathoms, and whistling for the
      breeze, said to me, &lsquo;We shall decidedly have to offer her an exhibition of
      tipsy British seamen as a final resource. The case is grave either way;
      but we cannot allow the concluding impression to be a dull one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It struck me with astonishment to see the vigilant watch she kept over the
      princess this day, after having left her almost uninterruptedly to my
      care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are better?&rsquo; She addressed Ottilia. &lsquo;You can sit up? You think you
      can walk? Then I have acted rightly, nay, judiciously,&mdash;I have not
      made a sacrifice for nothing. I took the cruise, mind you, on your
      account. You would study yourself to the bone, till you looked like a
      canary&rsquo;s quill, with that Herr Professor of yours. Now I &lsquo;ve given you a
      dose of life. Yes, you begin to look like human flesh. Something has done
      you good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess flushing scarlet, the margravine cried,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no occasion for you to have the whole British army in your
      cheeks. Goodness me! what&rsquo;s the meaning of it? Why, you answer me like
      flags, banners, uhlans&rsquo; pennons, fullfrocked cardinals!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father stepped in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, yes,&rsquo; said the margravine. &lsquo;But you little know, my good Roy, the
      burden of an unmarried princess; and heartily glad shall I be to hand her
      over to Baroness Turckems. That&rsquo;s her instituted governess, duenna,
      dragon, what you will. She was born for responsibility, I was not; it
      makes me miserable. I have had no holiday. True, while she was like one of
      their wax virgins I had a respite. Fortunately, I hear of you English,
      that when you fall to sighing, you suck your thumbs and are consoled.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father bowed her, and smiled her, and whirled her away from the
      subject. I heard him say, under his breath, that he had half a mind to
      issue orders for an allowance of grog to be served out to the sailors on
      the spot. I suggested, as I conceived in a similar spirit the forcible
      ducking of Mr. Peterborough. He appeared to entertain and relish the
      notion in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It might do. It would gratify her enormously,&rsquo; he said, and eyed the
      complacent clerical gentleman with transparent jealousy of his claims to
      decent treatment. &lsquo;Otherwise, I must confess,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;I am at a loss.
      My wits are in the doldrums.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went up to Mr. Peterborough, and, with an air of great sincerity and
      courtesy, requested him in French to create a diversion for her Highness
      the Margravine of Rippau during the extreme heat of the afternoon by
      precipitating himself headlong into forty fathoms, either attached or
      unattached. His art in baffling Mr. Peterborough&rsquo;s attempts to treat the
      unheard-of request as a jest was extraordinary. The ingenuity of his
      successive pleas for pressing such a request pertinaciously upon Mr.
      Peterborough in particular, his fixed eye, yet cordial deferential manner,
      and the stretch of his forefinger, and argumentative turn of the head&mdash;indicative
      of an armed disputant fully on the alert, and as if it were of profound
      and momentous importance that he should thoroughly defeat and convince his
      man&mdash;overwhelmed us. Mr. Peterborough, not being supple in French,
      fell back upon his English with a flickering smile of protestation; but
      even in his native tongue he could make no head against the tremendous
      volubility and brief eager pauses besetting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farce was too evanescent for me to reproduce it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peterborough turned and fled to his cabin. Half the crew were on the broad
      grin. The margravine sprang to my father&rsquo;s arm, and entreated him to be
      her guest in her Austrian mountain summer-seat. Ottilia was now her
      darling and her comfort. Whether we English youth sucked our thumbs, or
      sighed furiously, she had evidently ceased to care. Mr. Peterborough
      assured me at night that he had still a difficulty in persuading himself
      of my father&rsquo;s absolute sanity, so urgent was the fire of his eye in
      seconding his preposterous proposal; and, as my father invariably treated
      with the utmost reserve a farce played out, they never arrived at an
      understanding about it, beyond a sententious agreement once, in the
      extreme heat of an Austrian highland valley, that the option of taking a
      header into sea-water would there be divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our yacht winged her way home. Prince Ernest of Eppenwelzen-Sarkeld,
      accompanied by Baroness Turckems, and Prince Otto, his nephew, son of the
      Prince of Eisenberg, a captain of Austrian lancers, joined the margravine
      in Wurtemberg, and we felt immediately that domestic affairs were under a
      different management. Baroness Turckems relieved the margravine of her
      guard. She took the princess into custody. Prince Ernest greeted us with
      some affability; but it was communicated to my father that he expected an
      apology before he could allow himself to be as absolutely unclouded toward
      us as the blaze of his titles. My father declined to submit; so the prince
      inquired of us what our destination was. Down the Danube to the Black Sea
      and Asia Minor, Greece, Egypt, the Nile, the Desert, India, possibly, and
      the Himalayas, my father said. The prince bowed. The highest personages,
      if they cannot travel, are conscious of a sort of airy majesty pertaining
      to one who can command so wide and far a flight. We were supplicated by
      the margravine to appease her brother&rsquo;s pride with half a word. My father
      was firm. The margravine reached her two hands to him. He kissed over them
      each in turn. They interchanged smart semi-flattering or cutting
      sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good!&rsquo; she concluded; &lsquo;now I sulk you for five years.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would decapitate me, madam, and weep over my astonished head, would
      you not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my honour, I would,&rsquo; she shook herself to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled rather sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No pathos!&rsquo; she implored him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not while I live, madam,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this her countenance underwent a tremour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And when that ends... friend! well, I shall have had my last laugh in the
      world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Both seemed affected. My father murmured some soothing word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you do mean to stay with me?&rsquo; the margravine caught him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not in livery, your Highness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To the deuce with you!&rsquo; would be a fair translation of the exalted lady&rsquo;s
      reply. She railed at his insufferable pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you were wrong, wrong,&rsquo; she pursued. &lsquo;You offended the prince
      mightily: you travestied his most noble ancestor&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In your service, may it please you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You offended, offended him, I say, and you haven&rsquo;t the courage to make
      reparation. And when I tell you the prince is manageable as your ship, if
      you will only take and handle the rudder. Do you perceive?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hither, Mr. Harry; come, persuade him. Why, you do not desire to leave
      me, do you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Much the reverse. But I had to congratulate myself subsequently on having
      been moderate in the expression of my wishes; for, as my father explained
      to me, with sufficient lucidity to enlighten my dulness, the margravine
      was tempting him grossly. She saw more than I did of his plans. She could
      actually affect to wink at them that she might gain her point, and have
      her amusement, and live for the hour, treacherously beguiling a hoodwinked
      pair to suppose her partially blind or wholly complaisant. My father knew
      her and fenced her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Had I yielded,&rsquo; he said, when my heart was low after the parting, &lsquo;I
      should have shown her my hand. I do not choose to manage the prince that
      the margravine may manage me. I pose my pride&mdash;immolate my son to it,
      Richie? I hope not. No. At Vienna we shall receive an invitation to
      Sarkeld for the winter, if we hear nothing of entreaties to turn aside to
      Ischl at Munich. She is sure to entreat me to accompany her on her annual
      visit to her territory of Rippau, which she detests; and, indeed, there is
      not a vine in the length and breadth of it. She thought herself broad
      awake, and I have dosed her with an opiate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He squeezed my fingers tenderly. I was in want both of consolation and
      very delicate handling when we drove out of the little Wurtemberg town: I
      had not taken any farewell from Ottilia. Baroness Turckems was already
      exercising her functions of dragon. With the terrible forbidding word
      &lsquo;Repose&rsquo; she had wafted the princess to her chamber in the evening, and
      folded her inextricably round and round in the morning. The margravine
      huffed, the prince icy, Ottilia invisible, I found myself shooting down
      from the heights of a dream among shattered fragments of my cloud-palace
      before I well knew that I had left off treading common earth. All my
      selfish nature cried out to accuse Ottilia. We drove along a dusty country
      road that lay like a glaring shaft of the desert between vineyards and
      hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There,&rsquo; said my father, waving his hand where the hills on our left fell
      to a distance and threw up a lofty head and neck cut with one white line,
      &lsquo;your Hohenzollerns shot up there. Their castle looks like a tight
      military stock. Upon my word, their native mountain has the air of a drum
      major. Mr. Peterborough, have you a mind to climb it? We are at your
      disposal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, thank you, sir,&rsquo; said the Rev. Ambrose, gazing
      enthusiastically, but daunted by the heat: &lsquo;if it is your wish?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have none that is not yours, Mr. Peterborough. You love ruins, and we
      are adrift just now. I presume we can drive to the foot of the ascent. I
      should wish my son perhaps to see the source of great houses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here it was that my arm was touched by old Schwartz. He saluted stiffly,
      and leaning from the saddle on the trot of his horse at an even pace with
      our postillion, stretched out a bouquet of roses. I seized it palpitating,
      smelt the roses, and wondered. May a man write of his foolishness?&mdash;tears
      rushed to my eyes. Schwartz was far behind us when my father caught sight
      of the magical flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come!&rsquo; said he, glowing, &lsquo;we will toast the Hohenstaufens and the
      Hohenzollerns to-night, Richie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, when I was revelling in fancies sweeter than the perfume of the
      roses, he pressed their stems reflectively, unbound them, and disclosed a
      slip of crested paper. On it was written:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &lsquo;Violets are over.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Plain words; but a princess had written them, and never did so golden a
      halo enclose any piece of human handiwork.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. THE TIME OF ROSES
    </h2>
    <p>
      I sat and thrilled from head to foot with a deeper emotion than joy. Not
      I, but a detached self allied to the careering universe and having life in
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Violets are over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The first strenuous effort of my mind was to grasp the meaning, subtle as
      odour, in these words. Innumerable meanings wreathed away unattainable to
      thought. The finer senses could just perceive them ere they vanished. Then
      as I grew material, two camps were pitched and two armies prepared to
      fight to establish one distinct meaning. &lsquo;Violets are over, so I send you
      roses&rsquo;; she writes you simple fact. Nay, &lsquo;Our time of violets is over, now
      for us the roses&rsquo;; she gives you heavenly symbolism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From violets to roses, so run the seasons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Or is it,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From violets to roses, thus far have we two travelled?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But would she merely say, &lsquo;I have not this kind of flower, and I send you
      another?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      True, but would she dare to say, &lsquo;The violets no longer express my heart;
      take the roses?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Maidenly, and a Princess, yet sweet and grateful, she gives you the
      gracefullest good speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Noble above all human distinctions, she binds you to herself, if you will
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The two armies came into collision, the luck of the day going to the one I
      sided with.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was curiously observable that the opposing force recovered energy
      from defeat, while mine languished in victory. I headed them alternately,
      and&mdash;it invariably happened so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She cannot mean so much as this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She must mean more than that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the Absolute and the Symbolical factions struggled on. A princess
      drew them as the moon the tides.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees they subsided and united, each reserving its view; a point at
      which I imagined myself to have regained my proper humility. &lsquo;The princess
      has sent you these flowers out of her homely friendliness; not seeing you
      to speak her farewell, she, for the very reason that she can do it
      innocent of any meaning whatsoever, bids you be sure you carry her esteem
      with you. Is the sun of blue heavens guilty of the shadow it casts? Clear
      your mind. She means nothing. Warmth and beauty come from her, and are on
      you for the moment. But full surely she is a thing to be won: she is
      human: did not her hand like a gentle snake seek yours, and detain it, and
      bear it away into the heart of her sleep?&mdash;Be moderate. Let not a
      thought or a dream spring from her condescension, lest you do outrage to
      her noble simplicity. Look on that high Hohenzollern hill-top: she also is
      of the line of those who help to found illustrious Houses: what are you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned to my father and stared him in the face. What was he? Were we not
      losing precious time in not prosecuting his suit? I put this question to
      him, believing that it would sound as too remote from my thoughts to
      betray them. He glanced at the roses, and answered gladly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes!&mdash;no, no! we must have our holiday. Mr. Peterborough is for
      exploring a battle-field in the neighbourhood of Munich. He shall. I wish
      him to see the Salzkammergut, and have a taste of German Court-life. Allow
      me to be captain, Richie, will you? I will show you how battles are gained
      and mountains are scaled. That young Prince Otto of Eisenberg is a fine
      young fellow. Those Austrian cavalry regiments are good training-schools
      for the carriage of a young man&rsquo;s head and limbs. I would match my boy
      against him in the exercises&mdash;fencing, shooting, riding.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you did at Bath,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied promptly: &lsquo;We might give him Anna Penrhys to marry. English
      wives are liked here&mdash;adored&mdash;if they fetch a dowry. Concerning
      my suit, Richie, enough if it keeps pace with us: and we are not going
      slow. It is a thing certain. Dettermain and Newson have repeatedly said,
      &ldquo;Money, money!&rsquo; hand us money, and we guarantee you a public recognition.&rdquo;
       Money we now have. But we cannot be in two fields at once. Is it your
      desire to return to England?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; said I, with a chill at the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it is&mdash;?&rsquo; he pressed me, and relenting added: &lsquo;I confess I enjoy
      this Suabian land as much as you do. Indolence is occasionally charming. I
      am at work, nevertheless. But, Richie, determine not to think little of
      yourself: there is the main point; believe me, that is half the battle.
      You, sir, are one of the wealthiest gentlemen in Europe. You are
      pronouncedly a gentleman. That is what we can say of you at present, as
      you appear in the world&rsquo;s eye. And you are by descent illustrious. Well,
      no more of that, but consider if you kneel down, who will decline to put a
      foot on you? Princes have the habit, and they do it as a matter of course.
      Challenge them. And they, Richie, are particularly susceptible to pity for
      the misfortunes of their class&mdash;kind, I should say, for class it is
      not; now I have done. All I tell you is, I intend you, under my guidance,
      to be happy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought his remarks the acutest worldly wisdom I had ever heard,&mdash;his
      veiled method of treating my case the shrewdest, delicatest, and most
      consoling, most inspiring. It had something of the mystical power of the
      Oracles,&mdash;the power which belongs to anonymous writing. Had he
      disposed of my apparent rival, and exalted me to the level of a princely
      family, in open speech, he would have conveyed no balm to me&mdash;I
      should have classed it as one confident man&rsquo;s opinion. Disguised and
      vague, but emphatic, and interpreted by the fine beam of his eye, it was
      intoxicating; and when he said subsequently, &lsquo;Our majority Burgundy was
      good emperor wine, Richie. You approved it? I laid that vintage down to
      give you a lesson to show you that my plans come safe to maturity,&rsquo;&mdash;I
      credited him with a large share of foresight, though I well knew his habit
      of antedating his sagacity, and could not but smile at the illustration of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You perceive my state without rendering it necessary for me to label
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw her next in a pinewood between Ischl and the Traun. I had climbed
      the steep hill alone, while my father and Mr. Peterborough drove round the
      carriage-road to the margravine&rsquo;s white villa. Ottilia was leaning on the
      arm of Baroness Turckems, walking&mdash;a miracle that disentangled her
      cruelly from my net of fancies. The baroness placed a second hand upon her
      as soon as I was seen standing in the path. Ottilia&rsquo;s face coloured like
      the cyclamen at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You!&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I might ask, is it you, princess?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some wonder has been worked, you see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thank heaven.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had a part in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The poorest possible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yet I shall presume to call you Doctor Oceanus,&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you repeat his medicine? The yacht awaits you always.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I am well I study. Do not you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have never studied in my life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, lose no more time. The yacht is delicious idleness, but it is
      idleness. I am longing for it now, I am still so very weak. My dear Sibley
      has left me to be married. She marries a Hanoverian officer. We change
      countries&mdash;I mean,&rsquo; the princess caught back her tongue, &lsquo;she will
      become German, not compatriot of your ships of war. My English rebukes me.
      I cease to express... It is like my walking, done half for pride, I think.
      Baroness, lower me, and let me rest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The baroness laid her gently on the dry brown pine-sheddings, and blew a
      whistle that hung at her girdle, by which old Schwartzy kept out of sight
      to encourage the princess&rsquo;s delusion of pride in her walking, was
      summoned. Ottilia had fainted. The baroness shot a suspicious glance at
      me. &lsquo;It comes of this everlasting English talk,&rsquo; I heard her mutter. She
      was quick to interpose between me and the form I had once raised and borne
      undisputedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Schwartz is the princess&rsquo;s attendant, sir,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;In future, may I
      request you to talk German?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince of Eppenwelzen and Prince Otto were shooting in the mountains.
      The margravine, after conversing with the baroness, received me stiffly.
      She seemed eager to be rid of us; was barely hospitable. My mind was too
      confused to take much note of words and signs. I made an appointment to
      meet my father the day following, and walked away and returned at night,
      encountered Schwartz and fed on the crumbs of tidings I got from him, a
      good, rough old faithful fellow, far past the age for sympathy, but he had
      carried Ottilia when she was an infant, and meant to die in her service. I
      thought him enviable above most creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      His principal anxiety was about my finding sleeping quarters. When he had
      delivered himself three times over of all that I could lead him to say, I
      left him still puffing at his pipe. He continued on guard to be in
      readiness to run for a doctor, should one be wanted. Twice in the night I
      came across his path. The night was quiet, dark blue, and starry; the
      morning soft and fragrant. The burden of the night was bearable, but that
      of daylight I fled from, and all day I was like one expecting a crisis.
      Laughter, with so much to arouse it, hardly had any foothold within me to
      stir my wits. For if I said &lsquo;Folly!&rsquo; I did not feel it, and what I felt I
      did not understand. My heart and head were positively divided. Days and
      weeks were spent in reconciling them a little; days passed with a pencil
      and scribbled slips of paper&mdash;the lines written with regular
      commencements and irregular terminations; you know them. Why had Ottilia
      fainted? She recommended hard study&mdash;thinks me idle, worthless; she
      has a grave intelligence, a serious estimation of life; she thinks me
      intrinsically of the value of a summer fly. But why did she say, &lsquo;We
      change countries,&rsquo; and immediately flush, break and falter, lose command
      of her English, grow pale and swoon; why? With this question my disastrous
      big heart came thundering up to the closed doors of-comprehension. It was
      unanswerable. &lsquo;We change countries.&rsquo; That is, she and Miss Sibley change
      countries, because the English woman marries a German, and the German
      princess&mdash;oh! enormous folly. Pierce it, slay it, trample it under.
      Is that what the insane heart is big with? Throughout my night-watch I had
      been free of it, as one who walks meditating in cloisters on a sentence
      that once issued from divine lips. There was no relief, save in those
      pencilled lines which gave honest laughter a chance; they stood like such
      a hasty levy of raw recruits raised for war, going through the goose-step,
      with pretty accurate shoulders, and feet of distracting degrees of
      extension, enough to craze a rhythmical drill-sergeant. I exulted at the
      first reading, shuddered at the second, and at the third felt desperate,
      destroyed them and sat staring at vacancy as if I had now lost the power
      of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last I flung away idleness and came to a good resolution; and I carried
      it through. I studied at a famous German university, not far from Hanover.
      My father, after discussing my project with me from the point of view of
      amazement, settled himself in the University town, a place of hopeless
      dulness, where the stones of the streets and the houses seemed to have got
      their knotty problem to brood over, and never knew holiday. A fire for
      acquisition possessed me, and soon an ungovernable scorn for English
      systems of teaching&mdash;sound enough for the producing of gentlemen, and
      perhaps of merchants; but gentlemen rather bare of graces, and merchants
      not too scientific in finance. Mr. Peterborough conducted the argument
      against me until my stout display of facts, or it may have been my
      insolence, combined with the ponderous pressure of the atmosphere upon one
      who was not imbibing a counteracting force, drove him on a tour among
      German cathedrals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letters from Riversley informed me that my proceedings were approved,
      though the squire wanted me near him. We offered entertainments to the
      students on a vast scale. The local newspaper spoke of my father as the
      great Lord Roy. So it happened that the margravine at Sarkeld heard of us.
      Returning from a visit to the prince&rsquo;s palace, my father told me that he
      saw an opportunity for our being useful to the prince, who wanted money to
      work a newly-discovered coal-mine in his narrow dominions, and he
      suggested that I might induce the squire to supply it; as a last extremity
      I could advance the money. Meanwhile he had engaged to accompany the
      prince in mufti to England to examine into the working of coal-mines, and
      hire an overseer and workmen to commence operations on the Sarkeld
      property. It would be obligatory to entertain him fitly in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;During our absence the margravine will do her best to console you,
      Richie. The prince chafes at his poverty. We give him a display of wealth
      in England; here we are particularly discreet. We shall be surer of our
      ground in time. I set Dettermain and Newson at work. I have written for
      them to hire a furnished mansion for a couple of months, carriages,
      horses, lacqueys. But over here we must really be&mdash;goodness me! I
      know how hard it is!&mdash;we must hold the reins on ourselves tight.
      Baroness Turckems is a most estimable person on the side of her duty. Why,
      the Dragon of Wantley sat on its eggs, you may be convinced! She is a
      praiseworthy dragon. The side she presents to us is horny, and not so
      agreeable. Talk German when she is on guard. Further I need not counsel a
      clever old son. Counsel me, Richie. Would it be adviseable to run the
      prince down to Riversley?&mdash;a Prince!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! decidedly not,&rsquo; was my advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; he assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      I empowered him to sell out Bank stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote word from England of a very successful expedition. The prince,
      travelling under the title of Count Delzenburg, had been suitably
      entertained, received by Lady Wilts, Serena Marchioness of Edbury, Lady
      Denewdney, Lady Sampleman, and others. He had visited my grandfather&rsquo;s
      mine, and that of Miss Penrhys, and was astounded; had said of me that I
      wanted but a title to be as brilliant a parti as any in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The margravine must have received orders from her brother to be civil to
      me; she sent me an imperious invitation from her villa, and for this fruit
      of my father&rsquo;s diplomacy I yielded him up my daintier feelings, my
      judgement into the bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Snows of early Spring were on the pinewood country I had traversed with
      Temple. Ottilia greeted me in health and vivacity. The margravine led me
      up to her in the very saloon where Temple, my father, and I had sat after
      the finale of the statue scene, saying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our sea-lieutenant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It delights me to hear he has turned University student,&rsquo; she said; and
      in English: &lsquo;You have made friends of your books?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was dressed in blue velvet to the throat; the hair was brushed from
      the temples and bound in a simple knot. Her face and speech, fair and
      unconstrained, had neither shadow nor beam directed specially for me. I
      replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At least I have been taught to despise idleness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My Professor tells me it is strange for any of your countrymen to love
      books.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have some good scholars, princess.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have your Bentley and Porson. Oh! I know many of the world&rsquo;s men have
      grown in England. Who can deny that? What we mean is, your society is not
      penetrated with learning. But my Professor shall dispute with you. Now you
      are facile in our German you can defend yourself. He is a deep scholar,
      broad over tongues and dialects, European, Asiatic-a lion to me, poor
      little mouse! I am speaking of Herr Professor von Karsteg, lady aunt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak intelligibly, and don&rsquo;t drum on my ear with that hybrid language,&rsquo; 
      rejoined the margravine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hybrid! It is my Herr Professor&rsquo;s word. But English is the choice
      gathering of languages, and honey is hybrid, unless you condemn the bee to
      suck at a single flower.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! you strain compliments like the poet Fretzel,&rsquo; the margravine
      exclaimed. &lsquo;Luckily, they&rsquo;re not, addressed to human creatures. You will
      find the villa dull, Herr Harry Richmond. For my part, every place is dull
      to me that your father does not enliven. We receive no company in the
      prince&rsquo;s absence, so we are utterly cut off from fools; we have simply
      none about us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The deprivation is one we are immensely sensible of!&rsquo; said the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Laugh on! you will some day be aware of their importance in daily life,
      Ottilia.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess answered: &lsquo;If I could hate, it would be such persons.&rsquo; A
      sentence that hung in the memory of one knowing himself to be animated by
      the wildest genius of folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      We drove to the statue of Prince Albrecht Wohlgemuth, overlooking leagues
      of snow-roofed branches. Again Ottilia reverted to Temple,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That dear little friend of yours who wandered out with you to seek your
      father, and is now a sailor! I cannot forget him. It strikes me as a
      beautiful piece of the heroism of boys. You both crossed the sea to travel
      over the whole Continent until you should find him, did you not? What is
      hard to understand, is your father&rsquo;s not writing to you while he did us
      the favour to reside at the palace.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Roy is a butterfly,&rsquo; said the margravine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I cannot think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Roy was busy, he was occupied. I won&rsquo;t have him abused. Besides, one
      can&rsquo;t be always caressing and cajoling one&rsquo;s pretty brats.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is an intensely loving father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well; establish that, and what does it matter whether he wrote or
      not? A good reputation is the best vindication.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess smiled. &lsquo;See here, dearest aunty, the two boys passed half
      the night here, until my Aennchen&rsquo;s father gave them shelter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Apparently he passes half or all the night in the open air everywhere,&rsquo; 
      said the margravine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I glanced hurriedly over both faces. The margravine was snuffing her
      nostrils up contemptuously. The princess had vividly reddened. Her face
      was luminous over the nest of white fur folding her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I must have the taste for it: for when I was a child,&rsquo; said I,
      plunging at anything to catch a careless topic, &lsquo;I was out in my father&rsquo;s
      arms through a winter night, and I still look back on it as one of the
      most delightful I have ever known. I wish I could describe the effect it
      had on me. A track of blood in the snow could not be brighter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The margravine repeated,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A track of blood in the snow! My good young man, you have excited forms
      of speech.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I shuddered. Ottilia divined that her burning blush had involved me.
      Divination is fiery in the season of blushes, and I, too, fell on the
      track of her fair spirit, setting out from the transparent betrayal by
      Schwartz of my night-watch in the pine-wood near the Traun river-falls. My
      feelings were as if a wave had rolled me helpless to land, at the
      margravine&rsquo;s mercy should she put another question. She startled us with a
      loud outburst of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No! no man upon this earth but Roy could have sat that horse I don&rsquo;t know
      how many minutes by the clock, as a figure of bronze,&rsquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ottilia and I exchanged a grave look. The gentleness of the old time was
      sweet to us both: but we had the wish that my father&rsquo;s extravagant
      prominency in it might be forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the dinner-table I made the acquaintance of the Herr Professor Dr.
      Julius von Karsteg, tutor to the princess, a grey, broad-headed man, whose
      chin remained imbedded in his neck-cloth when his eyelids were raised on a
      speaker. The first impression of him was, that he was chiefly neck-cloth,
      coat-collar, grand head, and gruffness. He had not joined the ceremonial
      step from the reception to the dining saloon, but had shuffled in from a
      side-door. No one paid him any deference save the princess. The margravine
      had the habit of thrumming the table thrice as soon as she heard his
      voice: nor was I displeased by such an exhibition of impatience,
      considering that he spoke merely for the purpose of snubbing me. His
      powers were placed in evidence by her not daring to utter a sarcasm, which
      was possibly the main cause of her burning fretfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe there was not a word uttered by me throughout the dinner that
      escaped him. Nevertheless, he did his business of catching and worrying my
      poor unwary sentences too neatly for me, an admirer of real force and
      aptitude, to feel vindictive. I behaved to him like a gentleman, as we
      phrase it, and obtained once an encouraging nod from the margravine. She
      leaned to me to say, that they were accustomed to think themselves lucky
      if no learned talk came on between the Professor and his pupil. The truth
      was, that his residence in Sarkeld was an honour to the prince, and his
      acceptance of the tutorship a signal condescension, accounted for by his
      appreciation of the princess&rsquo;s intelligence. He was a man distinguished
      even in Germany for scholarship, rather notorious for his political and
      social opinions too. The margravine, with infinite humour in her
      countenance, informed me that he wished to fit the princess for the
      dignity of a Doctor of Laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It says much for her that he has not spoilt her manners; her health, you
      know, he succeeded in almost totally destroying, and he is at it again.
      The man is, I suspect, at heart arrant Republican. He may teach a girl
      whatever nonsensical politics he likes&mdash;it goes at the lifting of the
      bridegroom&rsquo;s little finger. We could not permit him to be near a young
      prince. Alas! we have none.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Professor allowed himself extraordinary liberties with strangers, the
      guests of the margravine. I met him crossing an inner court next day. He
      interrupted me in the middle of a commonplace remark, and to this effect:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are either a most fortunate or a most unfortunate young man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So profoundly penetrated with thoughtfulness was the tone of his voice
      that I could not take umbrage. The attempt to analyze his signification
      cost me an aching forehead, perhaps because I knew it too acutely.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. OTTILIA
    </h2>
    <p>
      She was on horseback; I on foot, Schwartz for sole witness, and a wide
      space of rolling silent white country around us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had met in the fall of the winter noon by accident. &lsquo;You like my
      Professor?&rsquo; said Ottilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do: I respect him for his learning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You forgive him his irony? It is not meant to be personal to you. England
      is the object; and partly, I may tell you, it springs from jealousy. You
      have such wealth! You embrace half the world: you are such a little
      island! All this is wonderful. The bitterness is, you are such a mindless
      people&mdash;I do but quote to explain my Professor&rsquo;s ideas. &ldquo;Mindless,&rdquo;
       he says, &ldquo;and arrogant, and neither in the material nor in the spiritual
      kingdom of noble or gracious stature, and ceasing to have a brave aspect.&rdquo;
       He calls you squat Goths. Can you bear to hear me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Princess!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And to his conception, you, who were pioneers when the earth had to be
      shaped for implements and dug for gold, will turn upon us and stop our
      march; you are to be overthrown and left behind, there to gain humility
      from the only teacher you can understand&mdash;from poverty. Will you
      defend yourself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, no, frankly, I will not. The proper defence for a nation is its
      history.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For an individual?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For a man, his readiness to abide by his word.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For a woman&mdash;what?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For a princess, her ancestry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! but I spoke of women. There, there is my ground of love for my
      Professor! I meet my equals, princes, princesses, and the man, the woman,
      is out of them, gone, flown! They are out of the tide of humanity; they
      are walking titles, &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; says my Professor, &ldquo;that tide is the blood of
      our being; the blood is the life-giver; and to be cut off from it is to
      perish.&rdquo; Our princely houses he esteems as dead wood. Not near so much say
      I: yet I hear my equals talk, and I think, &ldquo;Oh! my Professor, they testify
      to your wisdom.&rdquo; I love him because he has given my every sense a
      face-forward attitude (you will complain of my feebleness of speech) to
      exterior existence. There is a princely view of life which is a true one;
      but it is a false one if it is the sole one. In your Parliament your House
      of Commons shows us real princes, your Throne merely titled ones. I speak
      what everybody knows, and you, I am sure, are astonished to hear me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is owing to my Professor, my mind&rsquo;s father and mother. They say it is
      the pleasure of low-born people to feel themselves princes; mine it is to
      share their natural feelings. &ldquo;For a princess, her ancestry.&rdquo; Yes; but for
      a princess who is no more than princess, her ancestors are a bundle of
      faggots, and she, with her mind and heart tied fast to them, is, at least
      a good half of her, dead wood. This is our opinion. May I guess at your
      thoughts?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s more than I could dare to do myself, princess.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      How different from the Ottilia I had known, or could have imagined! That
      was one thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Out of the number, then, this,&rsquo; she resumed: &lsquo;you think that your English
      young ladies have command over their tongues: is it not so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are prattlers among them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are they educated strictly?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know little of them. They seem to me to be educated to conceal their
      education.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They reject ideas?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is uncertain whether they have had the offer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ottilia smiled. &lsquo;Would it be a home in their midst?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Something moved my soul to lift wings, but the passion sank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I questioned you of English ladies,&rsquo; she resumed, &lsquo;because we read your
      writings of us. Your kindness to us is that which passes from nurse to
      infant; your criticism reminds one of paedagogue and urchin. You make us
      sorry for our manners and habits, if they are so bad; but most of all you
      are merry at our simplicity. Not only we say what we feel, we display it.
      Now, I am so German, this offence is especially mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I touched her horse&rsquo;s neck, and said, &lsquo;I have not seen it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yet you understand me. You know me well. How is that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The murmur of honest confession came from me: &lsquo;I have seen it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. &lsquo;I bring you to be German, you see. Could you forsake your
      England?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Instantly, though not willingly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not regrettingly?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cheerfully, if I had my work and my&mdash;my friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; but well I know a man&rsquo;s field of labour is his country. You have your
      ambition.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, now I have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She struck a fir-branch with her riding-whip, scattering flakes on my
      head. &lsquo;Would that extinguish it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the form of an avalanche perhaps it would.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you make your aims a part of your life?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you win! or it is written of you that you never knew failure! So
      with me. I set my life upon my aim when I feel that the object is of true
      worth. I win, or death hides from me my missing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This I look to; this obtains my Professor&rsquo;s nod, and the approval of my
      conscience. Worthiness, however!&mdash;the mind must be trained to discern
      it. We can err very easily in youth; and to find ourselves shooting at a
      false mark uncontrollably must be a cruel thing. I cannot say it is
      undeserving the scourge of derision. Do you know yourself? I do not; and I
      am told by my Professor that it is the sole subject to which you should
      not give a close attention. I can believe him. For who beguiles so much as
      Self? Tell her to play, she plays her sweetest. Lurk to surprise her, and
      what a serpent she becomes! She is not to be aware that you are watching
      her. You have to review her acts, observe her methods. Always be above
      her; then by-and-by you catch her hesitating at cross-roads; then she is
      bare: you catch her bewailing or exulting; then she can no longer pretend
      she is other than she seems. I make self the feminine, for she is the
      weaker, and the soul has to purify and raise her. On that point my
      Professor and I disagree. Dr. Julius, unlike our modern Germans, esteems
      women over men, or it is a further stroke of his irony. He does not think
      your English ladies have heads: of us he is proud as a laurelled poet.
      Have I talked you dumb?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Princess, you have given me matter to think upon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, smiling with closed eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      I, now that speech had been summoned to my lips, could not restrain it,
      and proceeded, scarcely governing the words, quite without ideas; &lsquo;For you
      to be indifferent to rank&mdash;yes, you may well be; you have intellect;
      you are high above me in both&mdash;&rsquo; So on, against good taste and common
      sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      She cried: &lsquo;Oh! no compliments from you to me. I will receive them, if you
      please, by deputy. Let my Professor hear your immense admiration for his
      pupil&rsquo;s accomplishments. Hear him then in return! He will beat at me like
      the rainy West wind on a lily. &ldquo;See,&rdquo; he will say, when I am broken and
      bespattered, &ldquo;she is fair, she is stately, is she not!&rdquo; And really I feel,
      at the sound of praise, though I like it, that the opposite, satire,
      condemnation, has its good right to pelt me. Look; there is the tower,
      there &lsquo;s the statue, and under that line of pine-trees the path we ran up;&mdash;&ldquo;dear
      English boys!&rdquo; as I remember saying to myself; and what did you say of
      me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hand was hanging loose. I grasped it. She drew a sudden long breath,
      and murmured, without fretting to disengage herself,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friend, not that!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice carried an unmistakeable command. I kissed above the fingers and
      released them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you still able to run?&rsquo; said she, leading with an easy canter, face
      averted. She put on fresh speed; I was outstripped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she quitted me in anger? Had she parted from me out of view of the
      villa windows to make it possible for us to meet accidentally again in the
      shadow of her old protecting Warhead, as we named him from his appearance,
      gaunt Schwartz?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX. AN EVENING WITH DR. JULIUS VON KARSTEG
    </h2>
    <p>
      In my perplexity, I thought of the Professor&rsquo;s saying: &lsquo;A most fortunate
      or a most unfortunate young man.&rsquo; These words began to strike me as having
      a prophetic depth that I had not fathomed. I felt myself fast becoming
      bound in every limb, every branch of my soul. Ottilia met me smiling. She
      moved free as air. She could pursue her studies, and argue and discuss and
      quote, keep unclouded eyes, and laugh and play, and be her whole living
      self, unfettered, as if the pressure of my hand implied nothing. Perhaps
      for that reason I had her pardon. &lsquo;My friend, not that!&rsquo; Her imperishably
      delicious English rang me awake, and lulled me asleep. Was it not too
      securely friendly? Or was it not her natural voice to the best beloved,
      bidding him respect her, that we might meet with the sanction of her
      trained discretion? The Professor would invite me to his room after the
      &lsquo;sleep well&rsquo; of the ladies, and I sat with him much like his pipe-bowl,
      which burned bright a moment at one sturdy puff, but generally gave out
      smoke in fantastical wreaths. He told me frankly he had a poor idea of my
      erudition. My fancifulness he commended as something to be turned to use
      in writing stories. &lsquo;Give me time, and I&rsquo;ll do better things,&rsquo; I groaned.
      He rarely spoke of the princess; with grave affection always when he did.
      He was evidently observing me comprehensively. The result was beyond my
      guessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night he asked me what my scheme of life was.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the point of improvizing one of an impressive character, I stopped and
      confessed: &lsquo;I have so many that I may say I have none.&rsquo; Expecting reproof,
      I begged him not to think the worse of me for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite otherwise,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I have never cared to read deliberately in
      the book you open to me, my good young man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The book, Herr Professor?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Collect your wits. We will call it Shakespeare&rsquo;s book; or Gothe&rsquo;s, in the
      minor issues. No, not minor, but a narrower volume. You were about to give
      me the answer of a hypocrite. Was it not so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I admitted it, feeling that it was easily to have been perceived. He was
      elated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good. Then I apprehend that you wait for the shifting of a tide to carry
      you on?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I try to strengthen my mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I hear,&rsquo; said he dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, as far as your schools of teaching will allow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is, you read and commit to memory, like other young scholars.
      Whereunto? Have you no aim? You have, or I am told you are to have,
      fabulous wealth&mdash;a dragon&rsquo;s heap. You are one of the main drainpipes
      of English gold. What is your object? To spend it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall hope to do good with it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To do good! There is hardly a prince or millionaire, in history or alive,
      who has not in his young days hugged that notion. Pleasure swarms, he has
      the pick of his market. You English live for pleasure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are the hardest workers in the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That you may live for pleasure! Deny it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He puffed his tobacco-smoke zealously, and resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, you work hard for money. You eat and drink, and boast of your
      exercises: they sharpen your appetites. So goes the round. We strive, we
      fail; you are our frog-chorus of critics, and you suppose that your
      brekek-koax affects us. I say we strive and fail, but we strive on, while
      you remain in a past age, and are proud of it. You reproach us with lack
      of common sense, as if the belly were its seat. Now I ask you whether you
      have a scheme of life, that I may know whether you are to be another of
      those huge human pumpkins called rich men, who cover your country and
      drain its blood and intellect&mdash;those impoverishers of nature! Here we
      have our princes; but they are rulers, they are responsible, they have
      their tasks, and if they also run to gourds, the scandal punishes them and
      their order, all in seasonable time. They stand eminent. Do you mark me?
      They are not a community, and are not&mdash;bad enough! bad enough!&mdash;but
      they are not protected by laws in their right to do nothing for what they
      receive. That system is an invention of the commercial genius and the
      English.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have our aristocracy, Herr Professor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your nobles are nothing but rich men inflated with empty traditions of
      insufferable, because unwarrantable, pride, and drawing, substance from
      alliances with the merchant class. Are they your leaders? Do they lead you
      in Letters? in the Arts? ay, or in Government? No, not, I am informed, not
      even in military service! and there our titled witlings do manage to hold
      up their brainless pates. You are all in one mass, struggling in the
      stream to get out and lie and wallow and belch on the banks. You work so
      hard that you have all but one aim, and that is fatness and ease!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon me, Herr Professor,&rsquo; I interposed, &lsquo;I see your drift. Still I
      think we are the only people on earth who have shown mankind a
      representation of freedom. And as to our aristocracy, I must, with due
      deference to you, maintain that it is widely respected.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not conceive why he went on worrying me in this manner with his
      jealous outburst of Continental bile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Widely!&rsquo; he repeated. &lsquo;It is widely respected; and you respect it: and
      why do you respect it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have illustrious names in our aristocracy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We beat you in illustrious names and in the age of the lines, my good
      young man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But not in a race of nobles who have stood for the country&rsquo;s liberties.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So long as it imperilled their own! Any longer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, they have known how to yield. They have helped to build our
      Constitution.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Reverence their ancestors, then! The worse for such descendants. But you
      have touched the exact stamp of the English mind:&mdash;it is, to accept
      whatsoever is bequeathed it, without inquiry whether there is any change
      in the matter. Nobles in very fact you would not let them be if they
      could. Nobles in name, with a remote recommendation to posterity&mdash;that
      suits you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat himself up to stuff a fresh bowl of tobacco, while he pursued:
      &lsquo;Yes, yes: you worship your aristocracy. It is notorious. You have a sort
      of sagacity. I am not prepared to contest the statement that you have a
      political instinct. Here it is chiefly social. You worship your so-called
      aristocracy perforce in order to preserve an ideal of contrast to the
      vulgarity of the nation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was downright insolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was intolerable. I jumped on my feet. &lsquo;The weapons I would use in reply
      to such remarks I cannot address to you, Herr Professor. Therefore, excuse
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He sent out quick spirts of smoke rolling into big volumes. &lsquo;Nay, my good
      young Englishman, but on the other hand you have not answered me. And hear
      me: yes, you have shown us a representation of freedom. True. But you are
      content with it in a world that moves by computation some considerable sum
      upwards of sixty thousand miles an hour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not on a fresh journey&mdash;a recurring course!&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good!&rsquo; he applauded, and I was flattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I grant you the physical illustration,&rsquo; the Professor continued, and with
      a warm gaze on me, I thought. &lsquo;The mind journeys somewhat in that way, and
      we in our old Germany hold that the mind advances notwithstanding.
      Astronomers condescending to earthly philosophy may admit that advance in
      the physical universe is computable, though not perceptible. Some&mdash;whither
      we tend, shell and spirit. You English, fighting your little battles of
      domestic policy, and sneering at us for flying at higher game, you
      unimpressionable English, who won&rsquo;t believe in the existence of aims that
      don&rsquo;t drop on the ground before your eyes, and squat and stare at you, you
      assert that man&rsquo;s labour is completed when the poor are kept from crying
      out. Now my question is, have you a scheme of life consonant with the
      spirit of modern philosophy&mdash;with the views of intelligent, moral,
      humane human beings of this period? Or are you one of your robust English
      brotherhood worthy of a Caligula in his prime, lions in gymnastics&mdash;for
      a time; sheep always in the dominions of mind; and all of one pattern, all
      in a rut! Favour me with an outline of your ideas. Pour them out
      pell-mell, intelligibly or not, no matter. I undertake to catch you
      somewhere. I mean to know you, hark you, rather with your assistance than
      without it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We were deep in the night. I had not a single idea ready for delivery. I
      could have told him, that wishing was a good thing, excess of tobacco a
      bad, moderation in speech one of the outward evidences of wisdom; but
      Ottilia&rsquo;s master in the Humanities exacted civility from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I have few thoughts to communicate at present, Herr
      Professor. My German will fail me as soon as I quit common ground. I love
      my country, and I do not reckon it as perfect. We are swillers, possibly
      gluttons; we have a large prosperous middle class; many good men are to be
      found in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His discharges of smoke grew stifling. My advocacy was certainly of a
      miserable sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Herr Professor, on my way when a boy to this very place I met a
      thorough good man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I related the tale of my encounter with Captain Welsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Julius nodded rapidly for continuations. Further! further!
    </p>
    <p>
      He refused to dig at the mine within me, and seemed to expect it to
      unbosom its riches by explosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Herr Professor, we have conquered India, and hold it as no other
      people could.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vide the articles in the last file of English newspapers!&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suppose we boast of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you?&rsquo; he simulated wonderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, surely it&rsquo;s something!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something for non-commissioned officers to boast of; not for statesmen.
      However, say that you are fit to govern Asiatics. Go on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would endeavour to equalize ranks at home, encourage the growth of
      ideas...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Supporting a non-celibate clergy, and an intermingled aristocracy? Your
      endeavours, my good young man, will lessen like those of the man who
      employed a spade to uproot a rock. It wants blasting. Your married clergy
      and merchandized aristocracy are coils: they are the ivy about your social
      tree: you would resemble Laocoon in the throes, if one could imagine you
      anything of a heroic figure. Forward.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In desperation I exclaimed, &lsquo;It &lsquo;s useless! I have not thought at all. I
      have been barely educated. I only know that I do desire with all my heart
      to know more, to be of some service.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now we are at the bottom, then!&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I cried, &lsquo;Stay; let me beg you to tell me what you meant by calling me
      a most fortunate, or a most unfortunate young man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He chuckled over his pipe-stem, &lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How am I one or the other?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the weight of what you carry in your head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How by the weight?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shot a keen look at me. &lsquo;The case, I suspect, is singular, and does not
      often happen to a youth. You are fortunate if you have a solid and
      adventurous mind: most unfortunate if you are a mere sensational whipster.
      There &lsquo;s an explanation that covers the whole. I am as much in the dark as
      you are. I do not say which of us two has the convex eye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Protesting that I was unable to read riddles, though the heat of the one
      in hand made my frame glow, I entreated to have explicit words. He might
      be in Ottilia&rsquo;s confidence, probing me&mdash;why not? Any question he
      chose to put to me, I said, I was ready to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s the questioner who unmasks,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are we masked, Herr Professor? I was not aware of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look within, and avoid lying.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up. &lsquo;My nights,&rsquo; he remarked, &lsquo;are not commonly wasted in this
      manner. We Germans use the night for work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After a struggle to fling myself on his mercy and win his aid or counsel,
      I took his hand respectfully, and holding it, said, &lsquo;I am unable to speak
      out. I would if it involved myself alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, I comprehend; your country breeds honourable men, chivalrous
      youngsters,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;It &lsquo;s not enough&mdash;not enough. I want to see
      a mental force, energy of brain. If you had that, you might look as high
      as you liked for the match for it, with my consent. Do you hear? What I
      won&rsquo;t have is, flat robbery! Mark me, Germany or England, it &lsquo;s one to me
      if I see vital powers in the field running to a grand career. It &lsquo;s a fine
      field over there. As well there as here, then! But better here than there
      if it &lsquo;s to be a wasp&rsquo;s life. Do you understand me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I replied, &lsquo;I think I do, if I may dare to&rsquo;; and catching breath: &lsquo;Herr
      Professor, dear friend, forgive my boldness; grant me time to try me;
      don&rsquo;t judge of me at once; take me for your pupil&mdash;am I presumptuous
      in asking it?&mdash;make of me what you will, what you can; examine me;
      you may find there&rsquo;s more in me than I or anybody may know. I have
      thoughts and aims, feeble at present&mdash;Good God! I see nothing for me
      but a choice of the two&mdash;&ldquo;most unfortunate&rdquo; seems likeliest. You read
      at a glance that I had no other choice. Rather the extremes!&mdash;I would
      rather grasp the limits of life and be swung to the pits below, be the
      most unfortunate of human beings, than never to have aimed at a star. You
      laugh at me? An Englishman must be horribly in earnest to talk as I do
      now. But it is a star!&rsquo; (The image of Ottilia sprang fountain-like into
      blue night heavens before my eyes memorably.) &lsquo;She,&rsquo; was my next word. I
      swallowed it, and with a burning face, petitioned for help in my studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      To such sight as I had at that instant he appeared laughing outrageously.
      It was a composed smile &lsquo;Right,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;you shall have help in a
      settled course. Certain Professors, friends of mine, at your University,
      will see you through it. Aim your head at a star&mdash;your head!&mdash;and
      even if you miss it you don&rsquo;t fall. It&rsquo;s that light dancer, that gambler,
      the heart in you, my good young man, which aims itself at inaccessible
      heights, and has the fall&mdash;somewhat icy to reflect on! Give that
      organ full play and you may make sure of a handful of dust. Do you hear?
      It&rsquo;s a mind that wins a mind. That is why I warn you of being most
      unfortunate if you are a sensational whipster. Good-night Shut my door
      fast that I may not have the trouble to rise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I left him with the warm lamplight falling on his forehead, and books
      piled and sloped, shut and open; an enviable picture to one in my
      condition. The peacefulness it indicated made scholarship seem beautiful,
      attainable, I hoped. I had the sense to tell myself that it would give me
      unrotting grain, though it should fail of being a practicable road to my
      bright star; and when I spurned at consolations for failure, I could still
      delight to think that she shone over these harvests and the reapers.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. A SUMMER STORM, AND LOVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The foregoing conversations with Ottilia and her teacher, hard as they
      were for passion to digest, grew luminous on a relapsing heart. Without
      apprehending either their exact purport or the characters of the speakers,
      I was transformed by them from a state of craving to one of intense
      quietude. I thought neither of winning her, nor of aiming to win her, but
      of a foothold on the heights she gazed at reverently. And if, sometimes,
      seeing and hearing her, I thought, Oh, rarest soul! the wish was, that
      brother and sisterhood of spirit might be ours. My other eager thirstful
      self I shook off like a thing worn out. Men in my confidence would have
      supposed me more rational: I was simply possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      My desire was to go into harness, buried in books, and for recreation to
      chase visions of original ideas for benefiting mankind. A clear-wined
      friend at my elbow, my dear Temple, perhaps, could have hit on the track
      of all this mental vagueness, but it is doubtful that he would have pushed
      me out of the strange mood, half stupor, half the folding-in of passion;
      it was such magical happiness. Not to be awake, yet vividly sensible; to
      lie calm and reflect, and only to reflect; be satisfied with each
      succeeding hour and the privations of the hour, and, as if in the depths
      of a smooth water, to gather fold over patient fold of the submerged self,
      safe from wounds; the happiness was not noble, but it breathed and was
      harmless, and it gave me rest when the alternative was folly and
      bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visitors were coming to the palace to meet the prince, on his return with
      my father from England. I went back to the University, jealous of the
      invasion of my ecstatic calm by new faces, and jealous when there of the
      privileges those new faces would enjoy; and then, how my recent deadness
      of life cried out against me as worse than a spendthrift, a destroyer! a
      nerveless absorbent of the bliss showered on me&mdash;the light of her
      morning presence when, just before embracing, she made her obeisance to
      the margravine, and kindly saluted me, and stooped her forehead for the
      baroness to kiss it; her gestures and her voice; her figure on horseback,
      with old Warhead following, and I meeting her but once!&mdash;her walk
      with the Professor, listening to his instructions; I used to see them
      walking up and down the cypress path of the villa garden, her ear given to
      him wholly as she continued her grave step, and he shuffling and treading
      out of his line across hers, or on the path-borders, and never
      apologizing, nor she noticing it. At night she sang, sometimes mountain
      ditties to the accompaniment of the zither, leaning on the table and
      sweeping the wires between snatches of talk. Nothing haunted me so much as
      those tones of, her zither, which were little louder than summer gnats
      when fireflies are at their brightest and storm impends.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father brought horses from England, and a couple of English grooms, and
      so busy an air of cheerfulness, that I had, like a sick invalid, to beg
      him to keep away from me and prolong unlimitedly his visit to Sarkeld; the
      rather so, as he said he had now become indispensable to the prince
      besides the margravine. &lsquo;Only no more bronze statues!&rsquo; I adjured him. He
      nodded. He had hired Count Fretzel&rsquo;s chateau, in the immediate
      neighbourhood, and was absolutely independent, he said. His lawyers were
      busy procuring evidence. He had impressed Prince Ernest with a due
      appreciation of the wealth of a young English gentleman, by taking him
      over my grandfather&rsquo;s mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And, Richie, we have advanced him a trifle of thousands for the working
      of this coal discovery of his. In six weeks our schooner yacht will be in
      the Elbe to offer him entertainment. He graciously deigns to accept a
      couple of English hunters at our hands; we shall improve his breed of
      horses, I suspect. Now, Richie, have I done well? I flatter myself I have
      been attentive to your interests, have I not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He hung waiting for confidential communications on my part, but did not
      press for them; he preserved an unvarying delicacy in that respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have nothing to tell?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I have only to thank you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He left me. At no other period of our lives were we so disunited. I felt
      in myself the reverse of everything I perceived in him, and such letters
      as I wrote to the squire consequently had a homelier tone. It seems that I
      wrote of the pleasures of simple living&mdash;of living for learning&rsquo;s
      sake. Mr. Peterborough at the same time despatched praises of my sobriety
      of behaviour and diligent studiousness, confessing that I began to
      outstrip him in some of the higher branches. The squire&rsquo;s brief reply
      breathed satisfaction, but too evidently on the point where he had been
      led to misconceive the state of affairs. &lsquo;He wanted to have me near him,
      as did another person, whom I appeared to be forgetting; he granted me
      another year&rsquo;s leave of absence, bidding me bluffly not to be a bookworm
      and forget I was an Englishman.&rsquo; The idea that I was deceiving him never
      entered my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was deceiving everybody, myself in the bargain, as a man must do when in
      chase of a woman above him in rank. The chase necessitates deceit&mdash;who
      knows? chicanery of a sort as well; it brings inevitable humiliations;
      such that ever since the commencement of it at speed I could barely think
      of my father with comfort, and rarely met him with pleasure. With what
      manner of face could I go before the prince or the margravine, and say, I
      am an English commoner, the son of a man of doubtful birth, and I claim
      the hand of the princess? What contortions were not in store for these
      features of mine! Even as affairs stood now, could I make a confidant of
      Temple and let him see me through the stages of the adventure? My jingling
      of verses, my fretting about the signification of flowers, and trifling
      with symbols, haunted me excrutiatingly, taunting me with I know not what
      abject vileness of spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of these tortures an arrow struck me, in the shape of an
      anonymous letter, containing one brief line: &lsquo;The princess is in need of
      help.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I threw my books aside, and repaired to Count Fretzel&rsquo;s chateau, from
      which, happily, my father was absent; but the countenance of the princess
      gave me no encouragement to dream I could be of help to her; yet a second
      unsigned note worded in a quaint blunt manner, insisted that it was to me
      she looked. I chanced to hear the margravine, addressing Baroness
      Turckems, say: &lsquo;The princess&rsquo;s betrothal,&rsquo; what further, escaped me. Soon
      after, I heard that Prince Otto was a visitor at the lake-palace. My
      unknown correspondent plied me a third time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pasted the scrap in my neglected book of notes and reflections, where it
      had ample space and about equal lucidity. It drew me to the book, nearly
      driving me desperate; I was now credulous of anything, except that the
      princess cared for help from me. I resolved to go home; I had no longer
      any zeal for study. The desolation of the picture of England in my mind
      grew congenial. It became imperative that I should go somewhere, for news
      arrived of my father&rsquo;s approach with a French company of actors, and
      deafening entertainments were at hand. On the whole, I thought it decent
      to finish my course at the University, if I had not quite lost the power
      of getting into the heart of books. One who studies is not being a fool:
      that is an established truth. I thanked Dr. Julius for planting it among
      my recollections. The bone and marrow of study form the surest antidote to
      the madness of that light gambler, the heart, and distasteful as books
      were, I had gained the habit of sitting down to them, which was as good as
      an instinct toward the right medicine, if it would but work.
    </p>
    <p>
      On an afternoon of great heat I rode out for a gaze at the lake-palace,
      that I chose to fancy might be the last, foreseeing the possibility of one
      of my fits of movement coming on me before sunset. My very pulses throbbed
      &lsquo;away!&rsquo; Transferring the sense of overwhelming heat to my moral condition,
      I thought it the despair of silliness to stay baking in that stagnant
      place, where the sky did nothing but shine, gave nothing forth. The sky
      was bronze, a vast furnace dome. The folds of light and shadow everywhere
      were satin-rich; shadows perforce of blackness had light in them, and the
      light a sword-like sharpness over their edges. It was inanimate radiance.
      The laurels sparkled as with frost-points; the denser foliage dropped
      burning brown: a sickly saint&rsquo;s-ring was round the heads of the pines.
      That afternoon the bee hummed of thunder, and refreshed the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pitied the horse I rode, and the dog at his heels, but for me the
      intensity was inspiriting. Nothing lay in the light, I had the land to
      myself. &lsquo;What hurts me?&rsquo; I thought. My physical pride was up, and I looked
      on the cattle in black corners of the fields, and here and there a man
      tumbled anyhow, a wreck of limbs, out of the insupportable glare, with an
      even glance. Not an eye was lifted on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw nothing that moved until a boat shot out of the bight of sultry
      lake-water, lying close below the dark promontory where I had drawn rein.
      The rower was old Schwartz Warhead. How my gorge rose at the impartial
      brute! He was rowing the princess and a young man in uniform across the
      lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      That they should cross from unsheltered paths to close covert was
      reasonable conduct at a time when the vertical rays of the sun were fiery
      arrow-heads. As soon as they were swallowed in the gloom I sprang in my
      saddle with torture, transfixed by one of the coarsest shafts of hideous
      jealousy. Off I flew, tearing through dry underwood, and round the bend of
      the lake, determined to confront her, wave the man aside, and have my last
      word with the false woman. Of the real Ottilia I had lost conception.
      Blood was inflamed, brain bare of vision: &lsquo;He takes her hand, she jumps
      from the boat; he keeps her hand, she feigns to withdraw it, all woman to
      him in her eyes: they pass out of sight.&rsquo; A groan burst from me. I
      strained my crazy imagination to catch a view of them under cover of the
      wood and torture myself trebly, but it was now blank, shut fast. Sitting
      bolt upright, panting on horseback in the yellow green of one of the open
      woodways, I saw the young officer raise a branch of chestnut and come out.
      He walked moodily up to within a yard of my horse, looked up at me, and
      with an angry stare that grew to be one of astonishment, said, &lsquo;Ah? I
      think I have had the pleasure&mdash;somewhere? in Wurtemberg, if I
      recollect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Prince Otto. I dismounted. He stood alone. The spontaneous question
      on my lips would have been &lsquo;Where is she?&rsquo; but I was unable to speak a
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;English?&rsquo; he said, patting the horse&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes&mdash;the horse? an English hunter. How are you, Prince Otto? Do you
      like the look of him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Immensely. You know we have a passion for English thoroughbreds. Pardon
      me, you look as if you had been close on a sunstroke. Do you generally
      take rides in this weather?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was out by chance. If you like him, pray take him; take him. Mount him
      and try him. He is yours if you care to have him; if he doesn&rsquo;t suit you
      send him up to Count Fretzel&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ve had riding enough in the light.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps you have,&rsquo; said he, and hesitated. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to resist the
      offer of such a horse. If you want to dispose of him, mention it when we
      meet again. Shall I try him? I have a slight inclination to go as hard as
      you have been going, but he shall have good grooming in the prince&rsquo;s
      stables, and that &lsquo;s less than half as near again as Count Pretzel&rsquo;s
      place; and a horse like this ought not to be out in this weather, if you
      will permit me the remark.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No: I&rsquo;m ashamed of bringing him out, and shan&rsquo;t look on him with
      satisfaction,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;Take him and try him, and then take him from me,
      if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know, I would advise your lying down in the shade awhile?&rsquo; he
      observed solicitously. &lsquo;I have seen men on the march in Hungary and Italy.
      An hour&rsquo;s rest under cover would have saved them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ice is the thing!&rsquo; he ejaculated. &lsquo;I &lsquo;ll ride and have some fetched to
      you. Rest here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With visible pleasure he swung to the saddle. I saw him fix his cavalry
      thighs and bound off as if he meant to take a gate. Had he glanced behind
      him he would have fancied that the sun had done its worst. I ran at full
      speed down the footpath, mad to think she might have returned homeward by
      the lake. The two had parted&mdash;why? He this way, she that. They would
      not have parted but for a division of the will. I came on the empty boat.
      Schwartz lay near it beneath heavy boughs, smoking and perspiring in
      peace. Neither of us spoke. And it was now tempered by a fit of alarm that
      I renewed my search. So when I beheld her, intense gratitude broke my
      passion; when I touched her hand it was trembling for absolute assurance
      of her safety. She was leaning against a tree, gazing on the ground, a
      white figure in that iron-moted gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Otto!&rsquo; she cried, shrinking from the touch; but at sight of me, all
      softly as a light in the heavens, her face melted in a suffusion of
      wavering smiles, and deep colour shot over them, heavenly to see. She
      pressed her bosom while I spoke: a lover&rsquo;s speech, breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You love me?&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have known it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Forgiven me? Speak, princess.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Call me by my name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My own soul! Ottilia!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She disengaged her arms tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have known it by my knowledge of myself,&rsquo; she said, breathing with her
      lips dissevered. &lsquo;My weakness has come upon me. Yes, I love you. It is
      spoken. It is too true. Is it a fate that brings us together when I have
      just lost my little remaining strength&mdash;all power? You hear me! I
      pretend to wisdom, and talk of fate!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to laugh in scorn of herself, and looked at me with almost a
      bitter smile on her features, made beautiful by her soft eyes. I feared
      from the helpless hanging of her underlip that she would swoon; a shudder
      convulsed her; and at the same time I became aware of the blotting out of
      sunlight, and a strange bowing and shore-like noising of the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not heed me,&rsquo; she said in happy undertones. &lsquo;I think I am going to cry
      like a girl. One cannot see one&rsquo;s pride die like this, without but it is
      not anguish of any kind. Since we are here together, I would have no other
      change.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke till the tears came thick.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her of the letters I had received, warning me of a trouble
      besetting her. They were, perhaps, the excuse for my conduct, if I had
      any.
    </p>
    <p>
      Schwartz burst on us with his drill-sergeant&rsquo;s shout for the princess.
      Standing grey in big rain-drops he was an object of curiosity to us both.
      He came to take her orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The thunder,&rsquo; he announced, raising a telegraphic arm, &lsquo;rolls. It rains.
      We have a storm. Command me, princess! your highness!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ottilia&rsquo;s eyelids were set blinking by one look aloft. Rain and lightning
      filled heaven and earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Direct us, you!&rsquo; she said to me gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The natural proposal was to despatch her giant by the direct way down the
      lake to fetch a carriage from the stables, or matting from the boathouse.
      I mentioned it, but did not press it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She meditated an instant. &lsquo;I believe I may stay with my beloved?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Schwartz and I ran to the boat, hauled it on land, and set it keel upward
      against a low leafy dripping branch. To this place of shelter, protecting
      her as securely as I could, I led the princess, while Schwartz happed a
      rough trench around it with one of the sculls. We started him on foot to
      do the best thing possible; for the storm gave no promise that it was a
      passing one. In truth, I knew that I should have been the emissary and he
      the guard; but the storm overhead was not fuller of its mighty burden than
      I of mine. I looked on her as mine for the hour, and well won.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. PRINCESS OTTILIA&rsquo;S LETTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      That hour of tempest went swift as one of its flashes over our little nest
      of peace, where we crouched like insects. The lightning and the deluge
      seemed gloriously endless. Ottilia&rsquo;s harbouring nook was dry within an
      inch of rushing floods and pattered mire. On me the torrents descended,
      and her gentle efforts drew me to her side, as with a maternal claim to
      protect me, or to perish in my arms if the lightning found us. We had for
      prospect an ever-outbursting flame of foliage, and the hubbub of the
      hissing lake, crimson, purple, dusky grey, like the face of a passionate
      creature scourged. It was useless to speak. Her lips were shut, but I had
      the intent kindness of her eyes on me almost unceasingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good hour slipped away. Old Warhead&rsquo;s splashed knees on the level of
      our heads were seen by us when the thunder had abated. Ottilia prepared to
      rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall hear from me,&rsquo; she said, bending with brows measuring the
      boat-roof, like a bird about to fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I see you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ultimately you surely will. Ah! still be patient.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I not? have I not been?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; and can you regret it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; but we separate!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you have us be two feet high for ever?&rsquo; she answered smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One foot high, or under earth, if it might be together!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor little gnomes!&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      The homeliness of our resting-place arrested her for an instant, and
      perhaps a touch of comic pity for things of such diminutive size as to see
      nothing but knees where a man stood. Our heads were hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Adieu! no pledge is needed,&rsquo; she said tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None!&rsquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to the upper world with a burning blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Schwartz had borne himself with extraordinary discretion by forbearing to
      spread alarm at the palace. He saluted his young mistress in the
      regulation manner while receiving her beneath a vast umbrella, the holiday
      peasant&rsquo;s invariable companion in these parts. A forester was in
      attendance carrying shawls, clogs, and matting. The boat was turned and
      launched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Adieu, Harry Richmond. Will you be quite patient till you hear from me?&rsquo; 
      said Ottilia, and added, &lsquo;It is my question!&rsquo; delightfully recalling old
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was soon gazing at the track of the boat in rough water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shouts were being raised somewhere about the forest, and were replied to
      by hearty bellow of the rower&rsquo;s lungs. She was now at liberty to join my
      name to her own or not, as she willed. I had to wait. But how much richer
      was I than all the world! The future owed me nothing. I would have
      registered a vow to ask nothing of it. Among the many determined purposes
      framing which I walked home, was one to obtain a grant of that bit of land
      where we had sat together, and build a temple on it. The fear that it
      might be trodden by feet of men before I had enclosed it beset me with
      anguish. The most absolute pain I suffered sprang from a bewildering
      incapacity to conjure up a vision of Ottilia free of the glittering
      accessories of her high birth; and that was the pain of shame; but it came
      only at intervals, when pride stood too loftily and the shadow of possible
      mischance threatened it with the axe.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not condemn me to long waiting. Her favourite Aennchen brought me
      her first letter. The girl&rsquo;s face beamed, and had a look as if she
      commended me for a worthy deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An answer, Aennchen?&rsquo; I asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes!&rsquo; said she anxiously; &lsquo;but it will take more time than I can
      spare.&rsquo; She appointed a meeting near the palace garden-gates at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      I chose a roof of limes to read under.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Noblest and best beloved!&rsquo; the princess addressed me in her own tongue,
      doubting, I perceived, as her training had taught her, that my English
      eyes would tolerate apostrophes of open-hearted affection. The rest was
      her English confided to a critic who would have good reason to be
      merciful:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The night has come that writes the chapter of the day. My father has had
      his interview with his head-forester to learn what has befallen from the
      storm in the forest. All has not been told him! That shall not be delayed
      beyond to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am hurried to it. And I had the thought that it hung perhaps at the
      very end of my life among the coloured leaves, the strokes of sunset&mdash;that
      then it would be known! or if earlier, distant from this strange
      imperative Now. But we have our personal freedom now, and I have learnt
      from minutes what I did mean to seek from years, and from our forest what
      I hoped that change of scene, travel, experience, would teach me. Yet I
      was right in my intention. It was a discreet and a just meaning I had. For
      things will not go smoothly for him at once: he will have his hard battle.
      He is proved: he has passed his most brave ordeal. But I! Shall I see him
      put to it and not certainly know myself? Even thus I reasoned. One cannot
      study without knowing that our human nature is most frail. Daily the body
      changes, daily the mind&mdash;why not the heart? I did design to travel
      and converse with various persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon it to one who knew that she would require super-feminine power of
      decision to resolve that she would dispose of herself!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I heard of Harry Richmond before I saw him. My curiosity to behold the
      two fair boys of the sailor kingdom set me whipping my pony after them
      that day so remote, which is always yesterday. My thoughts followed you,
      and I wondered&mdash;does he mean to be a distinguished countryman of his
      Nelson? or a man of learning? Then many an argument with &ldquo;my Professor,&rdquo;
       until&mdash;for so it will ever be&mdash;the weaker creature did succumb
      in the open controversy, and thought her thoughts to herself. Contempt of
      England gained on me still. But when I lay withered, though so young, by
      the sea-shore, his country&rsquo;s ancient grandeur insisted, and I dreamed of
      Harry Richmond, imagining that I had been false to my childhood. You stood
      before me, dearest. You were kind: you were strong, and had a gentle
      voice. Our souls were caught together on the sea. Do you recollect my slip
      in the speaking of Lucy Sibley&rsquo;s marriage?&mdash;&ldquo;We change countries.&rdquo; At
      that moment I smelt salt air, which would bring you to my sight and touch
      were you and I divided let me not think how far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow I tell the prince, my father, that I am a plighted woman. Then
      for us the struggle, for him the grief. I have to look on him and deal it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can refer him to Dr. Julius for my estimate of my husband&rsquo;s worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;My Professor&rdquo; was won by it. He once did incline to be the young bold
      Englishman&rsquo;s enemy. &ldquo;Why is he here? what seeks he among us?&rdquo; It was his
      jealousy, not of the man, but of the nation, which would send one to break
      and bear away his carefully cultivated German lily. No eye but his did
      read me through. And you endured the trial that was forced on you. You
      made no claim for recompense when it was over. No, there is no pure love
      but strong love! It belongs to our original elements, and of its purity
      should never be question, only of its strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could not help you when you were put under scrutiny before the
      margravine and the baroness. Help from me would have been the betrayal of
      both. The world has accurate eyes, if they are not very penetrating. The
      world will see a want of balance immediately, and also too true a balance,
      but it will not detect a depth of concord between two souls that do not
      show some fretfulness on the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it was considered that in refusing my cousin Otto and other proposed
      alliances, I was heart-free. An instructed princess, they thought, was of
      the woeful species of woman. You left us: I lost you. I heard you praised
      for civil indifference to me&mdash;the one great quality you do not
      possess! Then it was the fancy of people that I, being very cold, might be
      suffered to hear my cousin plead for himself. The majority of our family
      favour Otto. He was permitted to woo me as though I had been a simple
      maid; and henceforth shall I have pity for all poor little feminine things
      who are so persecuted, asked to inflict cruelty&mdash;to take a sword and
      strike with it. But I&mdash;who look on marriage as more than a surrender&mdash;I
      could well withstand surpassing eloquence. It was easy to me to be
      inflexible in speech and will when I stood there, entreated to change
      myself. But when came magically the other, who is my heart, my voice, my
      mate, the half of me, and broke into illumination of things long hidden&mdash;oh!
      then did I say to you that it was my weakness had come upon me? It was my
      last outcry of self&mdash;the &ldquo;I&rdquo; expiring. I am now yours, &ldquo;We&rdquo; has long
      overshadowed &ldquo;I,&rdquo; and now engulphs it. We are one. If it were new to me to
      find myself interrogating the mind of my beloved, relying on his courage,
      taking many proofs of his devotion, I might pause to re-peruse my words
      here, without scruple, written. I sign it, before heaven, your Ottilia.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. AN INTERVIEW WITH PRINCE ERNEST AND A MEETING WITH PRINCE
      OTTO
    </h2>
    <p>
      A messenger from Prince Ernest commanding my immediate attendance at the
      palace signified that the battle had begun. I could have waited for my
      father, whose return from one of his expeditions in the prince&rsquo;s service
      was expected every instant; but though I knew I should have, had a
      powerful coadjutor in him to assist me through such a conference, I
      preferred to go down alone. Prince Otto met me in the hall. He passed by,
      glancing an eye sharply, and said over his shoulder,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall have a word together presently!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The library door was flung open. Prince Ernest and the margravine were in
      the room. She walked out with angry majesty. The prince held his figure in
      the stiff attitude of reception. He could look imposing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The character of the interview was perceptible at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have not, I presume, to be informed of the business in hand, Mr.
      Richmond!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your Highness, I believe I can guess it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This started him pacing the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An impossibility! a monstrous extravagance! a thing unheard of! mania!
      mania!&rsquo; he muttered. &lsquo;You are aware, sir, that you have been doing your
      worst to destroy the settled arrangements of my family? What does it mean?
      In common reason you cannot indulge any legitimate hope of succeeding.
      Taking you as a foreigner, you must know that. Judge of the case by your
      own reigning Families. Such events never happen amongst them. Do you
      suppose that the possession of immense wealth entitles you to the
      immeasurable presumption of aspiring to equality of position with reigning
      Houses? Such folly is more frequently castigated than reasoned with. Why,
      now&mdash;now, were it published&mdash;that I had condescended&mdash;condescend
      as I am doing, I should be the laughing-stock of every Court in Europe.
      You English want many lessons. You are taught by your scribes to despise
      the dignity which is not supported by a multitude of bayonets, guns, and
      gold. I heard of it when I travelled incognito. You make merry over little
      potentates. Good. But do not cross their paths. Their dominion may be
      circumscribed, but they have it; and where we are now, my power equals
      that of the Kaiser and the Czar. You will do me the favour to understand
      that I am not boasting, not menacing; I attempt, since it is
      extraordinarily imposed on me, to instruct you. I have cause to be
      offended; I waive it. I meet you on common ground, and address myself to
      your good sense. Have you anything to say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Much, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Much?&rsquo; he said, with affected incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The painful hardship for me was to reply in the vague terms he had been
      pleased to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have much to say, your Highness. First, to ask pardon of you, without
      excusing myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A condition, apparently, that absolves the necessity for the grant. Speak
      precisely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was as careful as he in abstaining from any direct indication of his
      daughter&rsquo;s complicity, and said, &lsquo;I have offended your Highness. You have
      done me the honour to suggest that it is owing to my English training. You
      will credit my assurance that the offence was not intentional, not
      preconceived.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You charge it upon your having been trained among a nation of
      shopkeepers?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My countrymen are not illiterate or unmannerly, your Highness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not spoken it; I may add, I do not think it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feared that your Highness entertained what I find to be a very general,
      perhaps here and there wilful, error with regard to England.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I was in the service I had a comrade, a gallant gentleman, deeply
      beloved by me, and he was an Englishman. He died in the uniform and under
      the flag I reverence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I rejoice that your Highness has had this experience of us. I have to
      imagine that I expressed myself badly. My English training certainly does
      not preclude the respect due to exalted rank. Your Highness will, I trust
      humbly, pardon my offence. I do not excuse myself because I cannot
      withdraw, and I am incapable of saying that I regret it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In cool blood you utter that?&rsquo; exclaimed the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      His amazement was unfeigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are the impossible, monstrous ideas you&mdash;where&mdash;? Who
      leads you to fancy there is one earthly chance for you when you say you
      cannot withdraw? Cannot? Are you requested? Are you consulted? It is a
      question to be decided in the imperative: you must. What wheel it is you
      think you have sufficient vigour to stop, I am profoundly unaware, but I
      am prepared to affirm that it is not the wheel of my household. I would
      declare it, were I a plain citizen. You are a nullity in the case, in
      point of your individual will&mdash;a nullity swept away with one wave of
      the hand. You can do this, and nothing else: you can apologize, recognize
      your station, repair a degree of mischief that I will not say was
      preconceived or plotted. So for awhile pursue your studies, your travels.
      In time it will give me pleasure to receive you. Mr. Richmond,&rsquo; he added,
      smiling and rising; &lsquo;even the head of a little German principality has to
      give numberless audiences.&rsquo; His features took a more cordial smile to
      convince me that the dismissing sentence was merely playful.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for me, my mind was confused by the visible fact that the father&rsquo;s
      features resembled the daughter&rsquo;s. I mention it, that my mind&rsquo;s condition
      may be understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had I been bowed out of the room when my father embraced me, and
      some minutes later I heard Prince Otto talking to me and demanding
      answers. That he or any one else should have hostile sentiments toward a
      poor devil like me seemed strange. My gift of the horse appeared to anger
      him most. I reached the chateau without once looking back, a dispirited
      wretch. I shut myself up; I tried to read. The singular brevity of my
      interview with the prince, from which I had expected great if not
      favourable issues, affected me as though I had been struck by a cannon
      shot; my brains were nowhere. His perfect courtesy was confounding. I was
      tormented by the delusion that I had behaved pusillanimously.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father rushed up to me after dark. Embracing me and holding me by the
      hand, he congratulated me with his whole heart. The desire of his life was
      accomplished; the thing he had plotted for ages had come to pass. He
      praised me infinitely. My glorious future, he said, was to carry a
      princess to England and sit among the highest there, the husband of a lady
      peerless in beauty and in birth, who, in addition to what she was able to
      do for me by way of elevation in my country, could ennoble in her own
      territory. I had the option of being the father of English nobles or of
      German princes; so forth. I did not like the strain; yet I clung to him. I
      was compelled to ask whether he had news of any sort worth hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None,&rsquo; said he calmly; &lsquo;none. I have everything to hear, nothing to
      relate; and, happily, I can hardly speak for joy.&rsquo; He wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      He guaranteed to have the margravine at the chateau within a week, which
      seemed to me a sufficient miracle. The prince, he said, might require
      three months of discretionary treatment. Three further months to bring the
      family round, and the princess would be mine. &lsquo;But she is yours! she is
      yours already!&rsquo; he cried authoritatively. &lsquo;She is the reigning intellect
      there. I dreaded her very intellect would give us all the trouble, and
      behold, it is our ally! The prince lives with an elbow out of his income.
      But for me it would be other parts of his person as well, I assure you,
      and the world would see such a princely tatterdemalion as would astonish
      it. Money to him is important. He must carry on his mine. He can carry on
      nothing without my help. By the way, we have to deal out cheques?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of myself, I caught the contagion of his exuberant happiness and
      faith in his genius. The prince had applauded his energetic management of
      the affairs of the mine two or three times in my hearing. It struck me
      that he had really found his vocation, and would turn the sneer on those
      who had called him volatile and reckless. This led me to a luxurious sense
      of dependence on him, and I was willing to live on dreaming and amused,
      though all around me seemed phantoms, especially the French troupe, the
      flower of the Parisian stage: Regnault, Carigny, Desbarolles, Mesdames
      Blanche Bignet and Dupertuy, and Mdlle. Jenny Chassediane, the most
      spirituelle of Frenchwomen. &lsquo;They are a part of our enginery, Richie,&rsquo; my
      father said. They proved to be an irresistible attraction to the
      margravine. She sent word to my father that she meant to come on a
      particular day when, as she evidently knew, I should not be present. Two
      or three hours later I had Prince Otto&rsquo;s cartel in my hands. Jorian
      DeWitt, our guest at this season, told me subsequently, and with the
      utmost seriousness, that I was largely indebted to Mdlle. Jenny for a
      touching French song of a beau chevalier she sang before Ottilia in my
      absence. Both he and my father believed in the efficacy of this kind of
      enginery, but, as the case happened, the beau chevalier was down low
      enough at the moment his highborn lady listened to the song.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that when Prince Otto met me after my interview with Prince
      Ernest, he did his best to provoke a rencontre, and failing to get
      anything but a nod from my stunned head, betook himself to my University.
      A friendly young fellow there, Eckart vom Hof, offered to fight him on my
      behalf, should I think proper to refuse. Eckart and two or three others
      made a spirited stand against the aristocratic party siding with Prince
      Otto, whose case was that I had played him a dishonourable trick to laugh
      at him. I had, in truth, persuaded him to relieve me at once of horse and
      rival at the moment when he was suffering the tortures of a rejection, and
      I was rushing to take the hand he coveted; I was so far guilty. But to how
      great a degree guiltless, how could I possibly explain to the satisfaction
      of an angry man? I had the vision of him leaping on the horse, while I
      perused his challenge; saw him fix to the saddle and smile hard, and away
      to do me of all services the last he would have performed wittingly. The
      situation was exactly of a sort for one of his German phantasy-writers to
      image the forest jeering at him as he flew, blind, deaf, and unreasonable,
      vehement for one fierce draught of speed. We are all dogged by the humour
      of following events when we start on a wind of passion. I could almost
      fancy myself an accomplice. I realized the scene with such intensity in
      the light running at his heels: it may be quite true that I laughed in the
      hearing of his messenger as I folded up the letter. That was the man&rsquo;s
      report. I am not commonly one to be forgetful of due observances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prospect of the possible eternal separation from my beloved pricked my
      mechanical wits and set them tracing the consequent line by which I had
      been brought to this pass as to a natural result. Had not my father
      succeeded in inspiring the idea that I was something more than something?
      The tendency of young men is to conceive it for themselves without
      assistance; a prolonged puff from the breath of another is nearly sure to
      make them mad as kings, and not so pardonably.
    </p>
    <p>
      I see that I might have acted wisely, and did not; but that is a
      speculation taken apart from my capabilities. If a man&rsquo;s fate were as a
      forbidden fruit, detached from him, and in front of him, he might hesitate
      fortunately before plucking it; but, as most of us are aware, the vital
      half of it lies in the seed-paths he has traversed. We are sons of
      yesterday, not of the morning. The past is our mortal mother, no dead
      thing. Our future constantly reflects her to the soul. Nor is it ever the
      new man of to-day which grasps his fortune, good or ill. We are pushed to
      it by the hundreds of days we have buried, eager ghosts. And if you have
      not the habit of taking counsel with them, you are but an instrument in
      their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      My English tongue admonishes me that I have fallen upon a tone resembling
      one who uplifts the finger of piety in a salon of conversation. A man&rsquo;s
      review of the course of his life grows for a moment stringently serious
      when he beholds the stream first broadening perchance under the light
      interpenetrating mine just now.
    </p>
    <p>
      My seconds were young Eckart vom Hof, and the barely much older, though
      already famous Gregorius Bandelmeyer, a noted mathematician, a savage
      Republican, lean-faced, spectacled, and long, soft-fingered; a cat to look
      at, a tiger to touch. Both of them were animated by detestation of the
      Imperial uniform. They distrusted my skill in the management of the weapon
      I had chosen; for reasons of their own they carried a case of pistols to
      the field. Prince Otto was attended by Count Loepel and a Major Edelsheim
      of his army, fresh from the garrison fortress of Mainz, gentlemen
      perfectly conversant with the laws of the game, which my worthy comrades
      were not. Several minutes were spent in an altercation between Edelsheim
      and Bandelmeyer. The major might have had an affair of his own had he
      pleased. My feelings were concentrated within the immediate ring where I
      stood: I can compare them only to those of a gambler determined to throw
      his largest stake and abide the issue. I was not open to any distinct
      impression of the surrounding scenery; the hills and leafage seemed to
      wear an iron aspect. My darling, my saint&rsquo;s face was shut up in my heart,
      and with it a little inaudible cry of love and pain. The prince declined
      to listen to apologies. &lsquo;He meant to teach me that this was not a laughing
      matter.&rsquo; Major Edelsheim had misunderstood Bandelmeyer; no offer of an
      apology had been made. A momentary human sensation of an unworthy sort
      beset me when I saw them standing together again, and contrasted the
      collectedness and good-humour of my adversary&rsquo;s representative with the
      vexatious and unnecessary naggling of mine, the sight of whose yard-long
      pipe scandalized me.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the practical word was given. The prince did not reply to my
      salute. He was smoking, and kept his cigar in one corner of his mouth, as
      if he were a master fencer bidding his pupil to come on. He assumed that
      he had to do with a bourgeois Briton unused to arms, such as we are
      generally held to be on the Continent. After feeling my wrist for a while
      he shook the cigar out of his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &lsquo;cliquetis&rsquo; of the crossed steel must be very distant in memory, and
      yourself in a most dilettante frame of mind, for you to be accessible to
      the music of that thin skeleton&rsquo;s clank. Nevertheless, it is better and
      finer even at the time of action, than the abominable hollow ogre&rsquo;s eye of
      the pistol-muzzle. We exchanged passes, the prince chiefly attacking. Of
      all the things to strike my thoughts, can you credit me that the vividest
      was the picture of the old woman Temple and I had seen in our boyhood on
      the night of the fire dropping askew, like forks of brown flame, from the
      burning house in London city; I must have smiled. The prince cried out in
      French: &lsquo;Laugh, sir; you shall have it!&rsquo; He had nothing but his
      impetuosity for an assurance of his promise, and was never able to force
      me back beyond a foot. I touched him on the arm and the shoulder, and
      finally pierced his arm above the elbow. I could have done nearly what I
      liked with him; his skill was that of a common regimental sabreur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ludere qui nescit campestribus abstinet armis!&rsquo; Bandelmeyer sang out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You observed?&rsquo; said Major Edelsheim, and received another disconcerting
      discharge of a Latin line. The prince frowned and made use of some
      military slang. Was his honour now satisfied? Not a whit. He certainly
      could not have kept his sword-point straight, and yet he clamoured to
      fight on, stamped, and summoned me to assault him, proposed to fight me
      with his left hand after his right had failed; in short, he was beside
      himself, an example of the predicament of a man who has given all the
      provocation and finds himself disabled. My seconds could have stopped it
      had they been equal to their duties; instead of which Bandelmeyer, hearing
      what he deemed an insult to the order of student and scholar, retorted
      furiously and offensively, and Eckart, out of good-fellowship, joined him,
      whereat Major Edelsheim, in the act of bandaging the prince&rsquo;s arm, warned
      them that he could not pass by an outrage on his uniform. Count Loepel
      stept politely forward, and gave Eckart a significant bow. The latter
      remarked mockingly, &lsquo;With pleasure and condescension!&rsquo; At a murmur of the
      name of doctor from Edelsheim, the prince damned the doctor until he or I
      were food for him. Irritated by the whole scene, and his extravagant
      vindictiveness, in which light I regarded the cloak of fury he had flung
      over the shame of his defeat, I called to Bandelmeyer to open his case of
      pistols and offer them for a settlement. As the proposal came from me, it
      was found acceptable. The major remonstrated with the prince, and
      expressed to me his regrets and et caeteras of well-meant civility. He had
      a hard task to keep out of the hands of Bandelmeyer, who had seized my
      sword, and wanted vi et armis to defend the cause of Learning and the
      People against military brigands on the spot. If I had not fallen we
      should have had one or two other prostrate bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silly business on all sides.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. WHAT CAME OF A SHILLING
    </h2>
    <p>
      The surgeon, who attended us both, loudly admired our mutual delicacy in
      sparing arteries and vital organs: but a bullet cuts a rougher pathway
      than the neat steel blade, and I was prostrate when the prince came to
      press my hand on his departure for his quarters at Laibach. The utterly
      unreasonable nature of a duel was manifested by his declaring to me, that
      he was now satisfied I did not mean to insult him and then laugh at him.
      We must regard it rather as a sudorific for feverish blood and brains. I
      felt my wound acutely, seeing his brisk step when he retired. Having
      overthrown me bodily, it threw my heart back to its first emotions, and I
      yearned to set eyes on my father, with a haunting sense that I had of late
      injured him and owed him reparation. It vanished after he had been in my
      room an hour, to return when he had quitted it, and incessantly and
      inexplicably it went and came in this manner. He was depressed. I longed
      for drollery, relieved only by chance allusions to my beloved one, whereas
      he could not conceal his wish to turn the stupid duel to account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pencil a line to her,&rsquo; he entreated me, and dictated his idea of a moving
      line, adding urgently, that the crippled letters would be affecting to
      her, as to the Great Frederick his last review of his invalid veterans.
      &lsquo;Your name&mdash;the signature of your name alone, darling Richie,&rsquo; and he
      traced a crooked scrawl with a forefinger,&mdash;&ldquo;Still, dearest angel, in
      contempt of death and blood, I am yours to eternity, Harry Lepel Richmond,
      sometimes called Roy&mdash;a point for your decision in the future, should
      the breath everlastingly devoted to the most celestial of her sex,
      continue to animate the frame that would rise on wings to say adieu!
      adieu!&rdquo;&mdash;Richie, just a sentence?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was distracting.
    </p>
    <p>
      His natural tenderness and neatness of hand qualified him for spreading
      peace in a sick-room; but he was too full of life and his scheme, and
      knowing me out of danger, he could not forbear giving his despondency an
      outlet. I heard him exclaim in big sighs: &lsquo;Heavens! how near!&rsquo; and again,
      &lsquo;She must hear of it!&rsquo; Never was man so incorrigibly dramatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would walk up to a bookcase and take down a volume, when the
      interjectional fit waxed violent, flip the pages, affecting a perplexity
      he would assuredly have been struck by had he perused them, and read, as
      he did once,&mdash;&lsquo;Italy, the land of the sun! and she is to be hurried
      away there, and we are left to groan. The conspiracy is infamous! One of
      the Family takes it upon himself to murder us! and she is to be hurried
      out of hearing! And so we are to have the blood of the Roys spilt for
      nothing?&mdash;no!&rsquo; and he shut up the book with a report, and bounded to
      my side to beg pardon of me. From his particular abuse of the margravine,
      the iteration of certain phrases, which he uttered to denounce and defy
      them, I gathered that an interview had passed between the two, and that
      she had notified a blockade against all letters addressed to the princess.
      He half admitted having rushed to the palace on his road to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Richie,&rsquo; said he, pressing me again to write the moving line, &lsquo;a
      letter with a broad black border addressed by me might pass.&rsquo; He looked
      mournfully astute. &lsquo;The margravine might say to herself, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Doctor
      Death in full diploma come to cure the wench of her infatuation.&rdquo; I am but
      quoting the coarse old woman, Richie; confusion on her and me! for I like
      her. It might pass in my handwriting, with a smudge for paternal grief&mdash;it
      might. &ldquo;To Her Serene Highness the Margravine of Rippau, etc., etc., etc.,
      in trust for the Most Exalted the Princess of Eppenwelzen-Sarkeld.&rdquo; I
      transpose or omit a title or so. &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s verwirrung in
      Roy&rsquo;s poor head, poor fellow; the boy has sunk to a certainty. Here (to
      the princess), it seems, my dear, this is for you. Pray do not communicate
      the contents for a day or so, or a month.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His imitation of the margravine was the pleasantest thing I heard from
      him. The princess&rsquo;s maid and confidante, he regretted to state, was
      incorruptible, which I knew. That line of Ottilia&rsquo;s writing, &lsquo;Violets are
      over,&rsquo; read by me in view of the root-mountain of the Royal House of
      Princes, scoffed at me insufferably whenever my father showed me these
      openings of his mind, until I was dragged down to think almost that I had
      not loved the woman and noble soul, but only the glorified princess&mdash;the
      carved gilt frame instead of the divine portrait! a shameful acrid
      suspicion, ransacking my conscience with the thrusting in of a foul torch
      here and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      For why had I shunned him of late? How was it that he tortured me now? Did
      I in no degree participate in the poignant savour of his scheme? Such
      questionings set me flushing in deadly chills. My brain was weak, my heart
      exhausted, my body seemed truthful perforce and confessed on the rack. I
      could not deny that I had partly, insensibly clung to the vain glitter of
      hereditary distinction, my father&rsquo;s pitfall; taking it for a substantial
      foothold, when a young man of wit and sensibility and, mark you, true
      pride, would have made it his first care to trample that under heel.
      Excellent is pride; but oh! be sure of its foundations before you go on
      building monument high. I know nothing to equal the anguish of an
      examination of the basis of one&rsquo;s pride that discovers it not solidly
      fixed; an imposing, self-imposing structure, piled upon empty cellarage.
      It will inevitably, like a tree striking bad soil, betray itself at the
      top with time. And the anguish I speak of will be the sole healthy sign
      about you. Whether in the middle of life it is adviseable to descend the
      pedestal altogether, I dare not say. Few take the precaution to build a
      flight of steps inside&mdash;it is not a labour to be proud of; fewer like
      to let themselves down in the public eye&mdash;it amounts to a
      castigation; you must, I fear, remain up there, and accept your chance in
      toppling over. But in any case, delude yourself as you please, your lofty
      baldness will assuredly be seen with time. Meanwhile, you cannot escape
      the internal intimations of your unsoundness. A man&rsquo;s pride is the front
      and headpiece of his character, his soul&rsquo;s support or snare. Look to it in
      youth. I have to thank the interminable hours on my wretched sick-bed for
      a singularly beneficial investigation of the ledger of my deeds and
      omissions and moral stock. Perhaps it has already struck you that one who
      takes the trouble to sit and write his history for as large a world as he
      can obtain, and shape his style to harmonize with every development of his
      nature, can no longer have much of the hard grain of pride in him. A proud
      puppet-showman blowing into Pandaean pipes is an inconceivable object,
      except to those who judge of characteristics from posture.
    </p>
    <p>
      It began to be observed by others that my father was not the most
      comforting of nurses to me. My landlady brought a young girl up to my
      room, and introduced her under the name of Lieschen, saying that she had
      for a long time been interested in me, and had been diligent in calling to
      inquire for news of my condition. Commanded to speak for herself, this
      Lieschen coloured and said demurely, &lsquo;I am in service here, sir, among
      good-hearted people, who will give me liberty to watch by you, for three
      hours of the afternoon and three of the early part of the night, if you
      will honour me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father took her shoulder between finger and thumb, and slightly shook
      her to each ejaculation of his emphatic &lsquo;No! no! no! no! What! a young
      maiden nurse to a convalescent young gentleman! Why, goodness gracious me!
      Eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me softly, and I said I wished her to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father appealed to the sagacity of the matron. So jealous was he of a
      suggested partner in his task that he had refused my earnest requests to
      have Mr. Peterborough to share the hours of watching by my side. The
      visits of college friends and acquaintances were cut very short, he soon
      reduced them to talk in a hush with thumbs and nods and eyebrows; and if
      it had not been so annoying to me, I could have laughed at his method of
      accustoming the regular visitors to make ready, immediately after
      greeting, for his affectionate dismissal of them. Lieschen went away with
      the mute blessing of his finger on one of her modest dimples; but, to his
      amazement, she returned in the evening. He gave her a lecture, to which
      she listened attentively, and came again in the morning. He was petrified.
      &lsquo;Idiots, insects, women, and the salt sea ocean!&rsquo; said he, to indicate a
      list of the untameables, without distressing the one present, and,
      acknowledging himself beaten, he ruefully accepted his holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was like sweet Spring in my room. She spoke of Sarkeld
      familiarly. She was born in that neighbourhood, she informed me, and had
      been educated by a dear great lady. Her smile of pleasure on entering the
      room one morning, and seeing me dressed and sitting in a grand-fatherly
      chair by the breezy window, was like a salutation of returning health. My
      father made another stand against the usurper of his privileges; he
      refused to go out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then must I go,&rsquo; said Lieschen, &lsquo;for two are not allowed here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No! don&rsquo;t leave me,&rsquo; I begged of her, and stretched out my hands for
      hers, while she gazed sadly from the doorway. He suspected some
      foolishness or he was actually jealous. &lsquo;Hum-oh!&rsquo; He went forthwith a
      murmured groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      She deceived me by taking her seat in perfect repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      After smoothing her apron, &lsquo;Now I must go,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! to leave me here alone?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the clock, and leaned out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not alone; oh, not alone!&rsquo; the girl exclaimed. &lsquo;And please, please do not
      mention me&mdash;presently. Hark! do you hear wheels? Your heart must not
      beat. Now farewell. You will not be alone: at least, so I think. See what
      I wear, dear Mr. Patient!&rsquo; She drew from her bosom, attached to a piece of
      blue ribbon, the half of an English shilling, kissed it, and blew a soft
      farewell to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not been long gone when the Princess Ottilia stood in her place.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shilling tossed by an English boy to a couple of little foreign girls in
      a woodman&rsquo;s hut!&mdash;you would not expect it to withstand the common
      fate of silver coins, and preserve mysterious virtues by living celibate,
      neither multiplying nor reduced, ultimately to play the part of a powerful
      magician in bringing the boy grown man to the feet of an illustrious lady,
      and her to his side in sickness, treasonably to the laws of her station.
      The little women quarrelled over it, and snatched and hid and contemplated
      it in secret, each in her turn, until the strife it engendered was put an
      end to by a doughty smith, their mother&rsquo;s brother, who divided it into
      equal halves, through which he drove a hole, and the pieces being now
      thrown out of the currency, each one wore her share of it in her bosom
      from that time, proudly appeased. They were not ordinary peasant children,
      and happily for them they had another friend that was not a bird of
      passage, and was endowed by nature and position to do the work of an
      angel. She had them educated to read, write, and knit, and learn pretty
      manners, and in good season she took one of the sisters to wait on her own
      person. The second went, upon her recommendation, into the household of a
      Professor of a neighbouring University. But neither of them abjured her
      superstitious belief in the proved merits of the talisman she wore. So
      when they saw the careless giver again they remembered him; their
      gratitude was as fresh as on that romantic morning of their childhood, and
      they resolved without concert to serve him after their own fashion, and
      quickly spied a way to it. They were German girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are now enabled to guess more than was known to Ottilia and me of the
      curious agency at work to shuffle us together. The doors of her suite in
      the palace were barred against letters addressed to the princess; the
      delivery of letters to her was interdicted, she consenting, yet she found
      one: it lay on the broad walk of the orange-trees, between the pleasure
      and the fruit-gardens, as if dropped by a falcon in mid air. Ottilia
      beheld it, and started. Her little maid walking close by, exclaimed,
      scuttling round in front of her the while like an urchin in sabots,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! what is it? a snake? let me! let me!&rsquo; The guileless mistress replied,
      &lsquo;A letter!&rsquo; Whereupon the maid said: &lsquo;Not a window near! and no wall
      neither! Why, dearest princess, we have walked up and down here a dozen
      times and not seen it staring at us! Oh, my good heaven!&rsquo; The letter was
      seized and opened, and Ottilia read:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;He who loves you with his heart has been cruelly used. They have
   shot him. He is not dead. He must not die. He is where he has
   studied since long. He has his medicine and doctors, and they say
   the bullet did not lodge. He has not the sight that cures. Now is
   he, the strong young man, laid helpless at anybody&rsquo;s mercy.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      She supped at her father&rsquo;s table, and amused the margravine and him
      alternately with cards and a sonata. Before twelve at midnight she was
      driving on the road to the University, saying farewell to what her mind
      reverenced, so that her lover might but have sight of her. She imagined I
      had been assassinated. For a long time, and most pertinaciously, this idea
      dwelt with her. I could not dispossess her of it, even after uttering the
      word &lsquo;duel&rsquo; I know not how often. I had flatly to relate the whole-of the
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But Otto is no assassin,&rsquo; she cried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was that she reverenced? It was what she jeopardized&mdash;her state,
      her rank, her dignity as princess and daughter of an ancient House, things
      typical to her of sovereign duties, and the high seclusion of her name. To
      her the escapades of foolish damsels were abominable. The laws of society
      as well as of her exalted station were in harmony with her intelligence.
      She thought them good, but obeyed them as a subject, not slavishly: she
      claimed the right to exercise her trained reason. The modestest, humblest,
      sweetest of women, undervaluing nothing that she possessed, least of all
      what was due from her to others, she could go whithersoever her reason
      directed her, putting anything aside to act justly according to her light.
      Nor would she have had cause to repent had I been the man she held me to
      be. Even with me she had not behaved precipitately. My course of probation
      was severe and long before she allowed her heart to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pale from a sleepless night and her heart&rsquo;s weariful eagerness to be near
      me, she sat by my chair, holding my hand, and sometimes looking into my
      eyes to find the life reflecting hers as in a sunken well that has once
      been a spring. My books and poor bachelor comforts caught her attention
      between-whiles. We talked of the day of storm by the lake; we read the
      unsigned letter. With her hand in mine I slept some minutes, and awoke
      grasping it, doubting and terrified, so great a wave of life lifted me up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No! you are not gone,&rsquo; I sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only come,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nature of the step she had taken began to dawn on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But when they miss you at the palace? Prince Ernest?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush! they have missed me already. It is done.&rsquo; She said it smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ottilia, will he take you away?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Us, dear, us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you meet his anger?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our aunt will be the executioner. We have a day of sweet hours before she
      can arrive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I see her first?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will both see her as we are now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must have prompt answers for the margravine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None, Harry. I do not defend myself ever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Distant hills, and folds of receding clouds and skies beyond them, were
      visible from my window, and beyond the skies I felt her soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ottilia, you were going to Italy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes: or whither they please, for as long as they please. I wished once to
      go, I have told you why. One of the series&rsquo; (she touched the letter lying
      on a reading-table beside her) &lsquo;turned the channel of all wishes and
      intentions. My friends left me to fall at the mercy of this one. I
      consented to the injunction that I should neither write nor receive
      letters. Do I argue ill in saying that a trust was implied? Surely it was
      a breach of the trust to keep me ignorant of the danger of him I love! Now
      they know it. I dared not consult them&mdash;not my dear father! about any
      design of mine when I had read this odd copybook writing, all in brief
      sentences, each beginning &ldquo;he&rdquo; and &ldquo;he.&rdquo; It struck me like thrusts of a
      sword; it illuminated me like lightning. That &ldquo;he&rdquo; was the heart within my
      heart. The writer must be some clever woman or simple friend, who feels
      for us very strongly. My lover assassinated, where could I be but with
      him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her little Ann coming in with chocolate and strips of fine white bread to
      dip in it stopped my efforts to explain the distinction between an
      assassination and a duel. I noticed then the likeness of Aennchen to
      Lieschen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has a sister here,&rsquo; said Ottilia; &lsquo;and let her bring Lieschen to
      visit me here this afternoon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Aennchen, with a blush, murmured, that she heard and would obey. I had a
      memorable pleasure in watching my beloved eat and drink under my roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duel remained incomprehensible to her. She first frightened me by
      remarking that duels were the pastime of brainless young men. Her next
      remark, in answer to my repeated attempts to shield my antagonist from a
      capital charge: &lsquo;But only military men and Frenchmen fight duels!&rsquo; 
      accompanied by a slightly investigating glance of timid surprise, gave me
      pain, together with a flashing apprehension of what she had forfeited,
      whom offended, to rush to the succour of a duellist. I had to repeat to
      her who my enemy was, so that there should be no further mention of
      assassination. Prince Otto&rsquo;s name seemed to entangle her understanding
      completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Otto! Otto!&rsquo; she murmured; &lsquo;he has, I have heard, been obliged by some
      so-called laws of honour once or twice to&mdash;to&mdash;he is above
      suspicion of treachery! To my mind it is one and the same, but I would not
      harshly exclude the view the world puts on things; and I use the world&rsquo;s
      language in saying that he could not do a dishonourable deed. How far he
      honours himself is a question apart. That may be low enough, while the
      world is full of a man&rsquo;s praises.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew the nature of a duel. &lsquo;It is the work of soulless creatures!&rsquo; she
      broke through my stammered explanations with unwonted impatience, and
      pressing my hand: &lsquo;Ah! You are safe. I have you still. Do you know, Harry,
      I am not yet able to endure accidents and misadventures: I have not
      fortitude to meet them, or intelligence to account for them. They are
      little ironical laughter. Say we build so high: the lightning strikes us:&mdash;why
      build at all? The Summer fly is happier. If I had lost you! I can almost
      imagine that I should have asked for revenge. For why should the bravest
      and purest soul of my worship be snatched away? I am not talking wisdom,
      only my shaken self will speak just now! I pardon Otto, though he has
      behaved basely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, not basely,&rsquo; I felt bound to plead on his behalf, thinking, in spite
      of a veritable anguish of gathering dread, that she had become enlightened
      and would soon take the common view of our case; &lsquo;not basely. He was
      excessively irritated, without cause in my opinion; he simply
      misunderstood certain matters. Dearest, you have nations fighting: a war
      is only an exaggerated form of duelling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nations at war are wild beasts,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;The passions of these
      hordes of men are not an example for a living soul. Our souls grow up to
      the light: we must keep eye on the light, and look no lower. Nations
      appear to me to have no worse than a soiled mirror of themselves in mobs.
      They are still uncivilized: they still bear a resemblance to the old
      monsters of the mud. Do you not see their claws and fangs, Harry? Do you
      find an apology in their acts for intemperate conduct? Men who fight duels
      appear in my sight no nobler than the first desperate creatures spelling
      the cruel A B C of the passions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, nor in mine,&rsquo; I assented hastily. &lsquo;We are not perfect. But hear me.
      Yes, the passions are cruel. Circumstances however&mdash;I mean, there are
      social usages&mdash;Ay, if one were always looking up t. But should we not
      be gentle with our comparisons if we would have our views in proportion?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She hung studiously silent, and I pursued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I trust you so much as my helper and my friend that I tell you what we do
      not usually tell to women&mdash;the facts, and the names connected with
      them. Sooner or later you would have learnt everything. Beloved, I do not
      wait to let you hear it by degrees, to be reconciled to it piecemeal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I forgive him,&rsquo; she sighed. &lsquo;I scarcely bring myself to believe that
      Harry has bled from Otto&rsquo;s hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was the accident of the case, Ottilia. We had to meet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To meet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are circumstances when men will not accept apologies; they&mdash;we&mdash;heaven
      knows, I was ready to do all that a man could do to avoid this folly&mdash;wickedness;
      give it the worst of titles!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It did not occur accidentally?&rsquo; she inquired. Her voice sounded strange,
      half withheld in the utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It occurred,&rsquo; said I, feeling my strength ebb and despair set in, &lsquo;it
      occurred&mdash;the prince compelled me to the meet him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But my cousin Otto is no assassin?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Compelled, I say: that is, he conceived I had injured him, and left me no
      other way of making amends.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her defence of Otto was in reality the vehement cherishing of her idea of
      me. This caused her bewilderment, and like a barrier to the flowing of her
      mind it resisted and resisted. She could not suffer herself to realize
      that I was one of the brainless young savages, creatures with claws and
      fangs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was unchanged to me. The homeliness of her large mild eyes
      embraced me unshadowed, and took me to its inner fire unreservedly.
      Leaning in my roomy chair, I contemplated her at leisure while my heart
      kept saying &lsquo;Mine! mine!&rsquo; to awaken an active belief in its possession.
      Her face was like the quiet morning of a winter day when cloud and sun
      intermix and make an ardent silver, with lights of blue and faint fresh
      rose; and over them the beautiful fold of her full eyebrow on the eyelid
      like a bending upper heaven. Those winter mornings are divine. They move
      on noiselessly. The earth is still, as if awaiting. A wren warbles, and
      flits through the lank drenched brambles; hill-side opens green; elsewhere
      is mist, everywhere expectancy. They bear the veiled sun like a sangreal
      aloft to the wavy marble flooring of stainless cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was as fair. Gazing across her shoulder&rsquo;s gentle depression, I could
      have desired to have the couchant brow, and round cheek, and rounding chin
      no more than a young man&rsquo;s dream of woman, a picture alive, without the
      animating individual awful mind to judge of me by my acts. I chafed at the
      thought that one so young and lovely should meditate on human affairs at
      all. She was of an age to be maidenly romantic: our situation favoured it.
      But she turned to me, and I was glad of the eyes I knew. She kissed me on
      the forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sleep,&rsquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I feigned sleep to catch my happiness about me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some disenchanting thunder was coming, I was sure, and I was right. My
      father entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Princess!&rsquo; He did amazed and delighted homage, and forthwith
      uncontrollably poured out the history of my heroism, a hundred words for
      one;&mdash;my promptitude in picking the prince&rsquo;s glove up on my sword&rsquo;s
      point, my fine play with the steel, my scornful magnanimity, the
      admiration of my fellow-students;&mdash;every line of it; in stupendous
      language; an artillery celebration of victory. I tried to stop him.
      Ottilia rose, continually assenting, with short affirmatives, to his
      glorifying interrogations&mdash;a method he had of recapitulating the main
      points. She glanced to right and left, as if she felt caged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it known?&rsquo; I heard her ask, in the half audible strange voice which
      had previously made me tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Known? I certify to you, princess,&rsquo;&mdash;the unhappy man spouted his
      withering fountain of interjections over us anew; known in every Court and
      garrison of Germany! Known by this time in Old England! And, what was
      more, the correct version of it was known! It was known that the young
      Englishman had vanquished his adversary with the small sword, and had
      allowed him, because he had raged demoniacally on account of his lamed
      limb, to have a shot in revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The honour done me by the princess in visiting me is not to be known,&rsquo; I
      summoned energy enough to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father pledged himself to the hottest secresy, equivalent to a calm
      denial of the fact, if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray be at no trouble,&rsquo; she addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &lsquo;Where am I?&rsquo; look was painful in her aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      It led me to perceive the difference of her published position in visiting
      a duellist lover instead of one assassinated. In the latter case, the
      rashness of an hereditary virgin princess avowing her attachment might
      pass condoned or cloaked by general compassion. How stood it in the
      former? I had dragged her down to the duellist&rsquo;s level! And as she was not
      of a nature to practise concealments, and scorned to sanction them, she
      was condemned, seeing that concealment as far as possible was imperative,
      to suffer bitterly in her own esteem. This, the cruellest, was the least
      of the evils. To keep our names disjoined was hopeless. My weakened frame
      and mental misery coined tears when thoughts were needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently I found the room empty of our poor unconscious tormentor.
      Ottilia had fastened her hand to mine again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be generous,&rsquo; I surprised her by saying. &lsquo;Go back at once. I have seen
      you! Let my father escort you the road. You will meet the margravine, or
      some one. I think, with you, it will be the margravine, and my father puts
      her in good humour. Pardon a wretched little scheme to save you from
      annoyance! So thus you return within a day, and the margravine, shelters
      you. Your name will not be spoken. But go at once, for the sake of Prince
      Ernest. I have hurt him already; help me to avoid doing him a mortal
      injury. It was Schwartz who drove you? our old Schwartz! Old Warhead! You
      see, we may be safe; only every fresh minute adds to the danger. And
      another reason for going-another&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; she breathed, &lsquo;my Harry will talk himself into a fever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall have it if the margravine comes here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She shall not be admitted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or if I hear her, or hear that she has come! Consent at once, and revive
      me. Oh! I am begging you to leave me, and wishing it with all my soul.
      Think over what I have done. Do not write to me. I shall see the
      compulsion of mere kindness between the lines. You consent. Your wisdom I
      never doubt&mdash;I doubt my own.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When it is yours you would persuade me to confide in?&rsquo; said she, with
      some sorrowful archness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wits clear as hers could see that I had advised well, except in proposing
      my father for escort. It was evidently better that she should go as she
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      I refrained from asking her what she thought of me now. Suing for
      immediate pardon would have been like the applying of a lancet to a vein
      for blood: it would have burst forth, meaning mere words coloured by
      commiseration, kindness, desperate affection, anything but her soul&rsquo;s
      survey of herself and me; and though I yearned for the comfort passion
      could give me, I knew the mind I was dealing with, or, rather, I knew I
      was dealing with a mind; and I kept my tongue silent. The talk between us
      was of the possible date of my recovery, the hour of her return to the
      palace, the writer of the unsigned letters, books we had read apart or
      peeped into together. She was a little quicker in speech, less meditative.
      My sensitive watchfulness caught no other indication of a change.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father drove away an hour in advance of the princess to encounter the
      margravine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By,&rsquo; said he, rehearsing his exclamation of astonishment and delight at
      meeting her, &lsquo;by the most miraculous piece of good fortune conceivable,
      dear madam. And now comes the question, since you have condescended to
      notice a solitary atom of your acquaintance on the public highroad,
      whether I am to have the honour of doubling the freight of your carriage,
      or you will deign to embark in mine? But the direction of the horses&rsquo; 
      heads must be reversed, absolutely it must, if your Highness would repose
      in a bed to-night. Good. So. And now, at a conversational trot, we may
      happen to be overtaken by acquaintances.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no doubt of his drawing on his rarely-abandoned seven-league boots
      of jargon, once so delicious to me, for the margravine&rsquo;s entertainment.
      His lack of discernment in treating the princess to it ruined my patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sisters Aennchen and Lieschen presented themselves a few minutes
      before his departure. Lieschen dropped at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My child,&rsquo; said the princess, quite maternally, &lsquo;could you be quit of
      your service with the Mahrlens for two weeks, think you, to do duty here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Professor grants her six hours out of the twenty-four already,&rsquo; said
      I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To go where?&rsquo; she asked, alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To come here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here? She knows you? She did not curtsey to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nurses do not usually do that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of both girls was pitiable; but having no suspicion of the
      cause for it, I superadded,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She was here this morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! we owe her more than we were aware of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess looked on her kindly, though with suspense in the expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She told me of my approaching visitor,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! not told!&rsquo; Lieschen burst out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you,&rsquo;&mdash;the princess questioned her, and murmured to me, &lsquo;These
      children cannot speak falsehoods,&rsquo; they shone miserably under the burden
      of uprightness &lsquo;did you make sure that I should come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieschen thought&mdash;she supposed. But why? Why did she think and
      suppose? What made her anticipate the princess&rsquo;s arrival? This inveterate
      why communicated its terrors to Aennchen, upon whom the princess turned
      scrutinizing eyes, saying, &lsquo;You write of me to your sister?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, princess.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And she to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lieschen answered: &lsquo;Forgive me, your Highness, dearest lady!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You offered yourself here unasked?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, princess.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you written to others besides your sister?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seldom, princess; I do not remember.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know the obligation of signatures to letters?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been remiss in not writing to me, child.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, princess! I did not dare to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have not written to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! princess, how dared I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you speaking truthfully?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The unhappy girls stood trembling. Ottilia spared them the leap into the
      gulfs of confession. Her intuitive glance, assisted by a combination of
      minor facts, had read the story of their misdeeds in a minute. She sent
      them down to the carriage, suffering her culprits to kiss her fingers;
      while she said to one: &lsquo;This might be a fable of a pair of mice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was gone, after many fits of musing, the signification of it was
      revealed to my slower brain. I felt that it could not but be an additional
      shock to the regal pride of such a woman that these little maidens should
      have been permitted to act forcibly on her destiny. The mystery of the
      letters was easily explained as soon as a direct suspicion fell on one of
      the girls who lived in my neighbourhood and the other who was near the
      princess&rsquo;s person. Doubtless the revelation of their effective mouse plot
      had its humiliating bitterness for her on a day of heavy oppression, smile
      at it as she subsequently might. The torture of heart with which I twisted
      the meaning of her words about the pair of mice to imply that the pair had
      conspired to make a net for an eagle and had enmeshed her, may have struck
      a vein of the truth. I could see no other antithesis to the laudable
      performance of the single mouse of fable. Lieschen, when she next appeared
      in the character of nurse, met my inquiries by supplicating me to imitate
      her sister&rsquo;s generous mistress, and be merciful.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remarked by-and-by, of her own accord: &lsquo;Princess Ottilia does not
      regret that she had us educated.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A tender warmth crept round me in thinking that a mind thus lofty would
      surely be, however severe in its insight, above regrets and recantations.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV. I GAIN A PERCEPTION OF PRINCELY STATE
    </h2>
    <p>
      I had a visit from Prince Ernest, nominally one of congratulation on my
      escape. I was never in my life so much at any man&rsquo;s mercy: he might have
      fevered me to death with reproaches, and I expected them on hearing his
      name pronounced at the door. I had forgotten the ways of the world. For
      some minutes I listened guardedly to his affable talk. My thanks for the
      honour done me were awkward, as if they came upon reflection. The prince
      was particularly civil and cheerful. His relative, he said, had written of
      me in high terms&mdash;the very highest, declaring that I was blameless in
      the matter, and that, though he had sent the horse back to my stables, he
      fully believed in the fine qualities of the animal, and acknowledged his
      fault in making it a cause of provocation. To all of which I assented with
      easy nods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your Shakespeare, I think,&rsquo; said the prince, &lsquo;has a scene of young
      Frenchmen praising their horses. I myself am no stranger to the
      enthusiasm: one could not stake life and honour on a nobler brute. Pardon
      me if I state my opinion that you young Englishmen of to-day are sometimes
      rather overbearing in your assumption of a superior knowledge of
      horseflesh. We Germans in the Baltic provinces and in the Austrian cavalry
      think we have a right to a remark or two; and if we have not suborned the
      testimony of modern history, the value of our Hanoverian troopers is not
      unknown to one at least of your Generals. However, the odds are that you
      were right and Otto wrong, and he certainly put himself in the wrong to
      defend his ground.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I begged him to pass a lenient sentence upon fiery youth. He assured me
      that he remembered his own. Our interchange of courtesies was cordially
      commonplace: we walked, as it were, arm-in-arm on thin ice, rivalling one
      another&rsquo;s gentlemanly composure. Satisfied with my discretion, the prince
      invited me to the lake-palace, and then a week&rsquo;s shooting in Styria to
      recruit. I thanked him in as clear a voice as I could command:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your Highness, the mine flourishes, I trust?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It does; I think I may say it does,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;There is always the
      want of capital. What can be accomplished, in the present state of
      affairs, your father performs, on the whole, well. You smile&mdash;but I
      mean extraordinarily well. He has, with an accountant at his elbow, really
      the genius of management. He serves me busily, and, I repeat, well. A
      better employment for him than the direction of Court theatricals?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Undoubtedly it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or than bestriding a bronze horse, personifying my good ancestor! Are you
      acquainted with the Chancellor von Redwitz?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All I know of him, sir, is that he is fortunate to enjoy the particular
      confidence of his master.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has a long head. But, now, he is a disappointing man in action;
      responsibility overturns him. He is the reverse of Roy, whose advice I do
      not take, though I&rsquo;m glad to set him running. Von Redwitz is in the town.
      He shall call on you, and amuse an hour or so of your convalescence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I confessed that I began to feel longings for society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Ernest was kind enough to quit me without unmasking. I had not to
      learn that the simplest visits and observations of ruling princes signify
      more than lies on the surface. Interests so highly personal as theirs
      demand from them a decent insincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chancellor von Redwitz called on me, and amused me with secret anecdotes
      of all the royal Houses of Germany, amusing chiefly through the veneration
      he still entertained for them. The grave senior was doing his utmost to
      divert one of my years. The immoralities of blue blood, like the amours of
      the Gods, were to his mind tolerable, if not beneficial to mankind, and he
      presumed I should find them toothsome. Nay, he besought me to coincide in
      his excuses of a widely charming young archduchess, for whom no estimable
      husband of a fitting rank could anywhere be discovered, so she had to be
      bestowed upon an archducal imbecile; and hence&mdash;and hence&mdash;Oh,
      certainly! Generous youth and benevolent age joined hands of exoneration
      over her. The princess of Satteberg actually married, under covert, a
      colonel of Uhlans at the age of seventeen; the marriage was quashed, the
      colonel vanished, the princess became the scandalous Duchess of Ilm-Ilm,
      and was surprised one infamous night in the outer court of the castle by a
      soldier on guard, who dragged her into the guard-room and unveiled her
      there, and would have been summarily shot for his pains but for the locket
      on his breast, which proved him to be his sovereign&rsquo;s son.&mdash;A perfect
      romance, Mr. Chancellor. We will say the soldier son loved a delicate
      young countess in attendance on the duchess. The countess spies the
      locket, takes it to the duchess, is reprimanded, when behold! the locket
      opens, and Colonel von Bein appears as in his blooming youth, in Lancer
      uniform.&mdash;Young sir, your piece of romance has exaggerated history to
      caricature. Romances are the destruction of human interest. The moment you
      begin to move the individuals, they are puppets. &lsquo;Nothing but poetry, and
      I say it who do not read it&rsquo;&mdash;(Chancellor von Redwitz is the
      speaker) &lsquo;nothing but poetry makes romances passable: for poetry is the
      everlastingly and embracingly human. Without it your fictions are flat
      foolishness, non-nourishing substance&mdash;a species of brandy and gruel!&mdash;diet
      for craving stomachs that can support nothing solider, and must have the
      weak stuff stiffened. Talking of poetry, there was an independent
      hereditary princess of Leiterstein in love with a poet!&mdash;a Leonora
      d&rsquo;Este!&mdash;This was no Tasso. Nevertheless, she proposed to come to
      nuptials. Good, you observe? I confine myself to the relation of
      historical circumstances; in other words, facts; and of good or bad I know
      not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Chancellor von Redwitz smoothed the black silk stocking of his crossed
      leg, and set his bunch of seals and watch-key swinging. He resumed,
      entirely to amuse me,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Princess Elizabeth of Leiterstein promised all the qualities which
      the most solicitous of paternal princes could desire as a guarantee for
      the judicious government of the territory to be bequeathed to her at his
      demise. But, as there is no romance to be extracted from her story, I may
      as well tell you at once that she did not espouse the poet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the contrary, dear Mr. Chancellor, I am interested in the princess.
      Proceed, and be as minute as you please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is but a commonplace excerpt of secret historical narrative buried
      among the archives of the Family, my good Mr. Richmond. The Princess
      Elizabeth thoughtlessly pledged her hand to the young sonneteer. Of
      course, she could not fulfil her engagement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see, you are impatient for romance, young gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all, Mr. Chancellor. I do but ask a question.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You fence. Your question was dictated by impatience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, for the facts and elucidations!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For the romance, that is. You wish me to depict emotions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon this destroyer of temper embrowned his nostrils with snuff,
      adding,&mdash;&lsquo;I am unable to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then one is not to learn why the princess could not fulfil her
      engagement?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Judged from the point of view of the pretender to the supreme honour of
      the splendid alliance, the fault was none of hers. She overlooked his
      humble, his peculiarly dubious, birth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her father interposed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Family?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite inefficacious to arrest her determinations.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What then&mdash;what was in her way?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Germany.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Great Germany, young gentleman. I should have premised that, besides
      mental, she had eminent moral dispositions,&mdash;I might term it the
      conscience of her illustrious rank. She would have raised the poet to
      equal rank beside her had she possessed the power. She could and did defy
      the Family, and subdue her worshipping father, the most noble prince, to a
      form of paralysis of acquiescence&mdash;if I make myself understood. But
      she was unsuccessful in her application for the sanction of the Diet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Diet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The German Diet. Have you not lived among us long enough to know that the
      German Diet is the seat of domestic legislation for the princely Houses of
      Germany? A prince or a princess may say, &ldquo;I will this or that.&rdquo; The Diet
      says, &ldquo;Thou shalt not&rdquo;; pre-eminently, &ldquo;Thou shalt not mix thy blood with
      that of an impure race, nor with blood of inferiors.&rdquo; Hence, we have it
      what we see it, a translucent flood down from the topmost founts of time.
      So we revere it. &ldquo;Qua man and woman,&rdquo; the Diet says, by implication, &ldquo;do
      as you like, marry in the ditches, spawn plentifully. Qua prince and
      princess, No! Your nuptials are nought. Or would you maintain them a legal
      ceremony, and be bound by them, you descend, you go forth; you are no
      reigning sovereign, you are a private person.&rdquo; His Serene Highness the
      prince was thus prohibited from affording help to his daughter. The
      princess was reduced to the decision either that she, the sole child born
      of him in legal wedlock, would render him qua prince childless, or that
      she would&mdash;in short, would have her woman&rsquo;s way. The sovereignty of
      Leiterstein continued uninterruptedly with the elder branch. She was a
      true princess.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A true woman,&rsquo; said I, thinking the sneer weighty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chancellor begged me to recollect that he had warned me there was no
      romance to be expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed; and bowed during the remainder of the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chancellor von Redwitz had performed his mission. The hours of my
      convalescence were furnished with food for amusement sufficient to sustain
      a year&rsquo;s blockade; I had no further longing for society, but I craved for
      fresh air intensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did Ottilia know that this iron law, enforced with the might of a whole
      empire, environed her, held her fast from any motion of heart and will? I
      could not get to mind that the prince had hinted at the existence of such
      a law. Yet why should he have done so? The word impossible, in which he
      had not been sparing when he deigned to speak distinctly, comprised
      everything. More profitable than shooting empty questions at the sky was
      the speculation on his project in receiving me at the palace, and that was
      dark. My father, who might now have helped me, was off on duty again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found myself driving into Sarkeld with a sense of a whirlwind round my
      head; wheels in multitudes were spinning inside, striking sparks for
      thoughts. I met an orderly in hussar uniform of blue and silver, trotting
      on his errand. There he was; and whether many were behind him or he stood
      for the army in its might, he wore the trappings of an old princely House
      that nestled proudly in the bosom of its great jealous Fatherland.
      Previously in Sarkeld I had noticed members of the diminutive army to
      smile down on them. I saw the princely arms and colours on various houses
      and in the windows of shops. Emblems of a small State, they belonged to
      the history of the Empire. The Court-physician passed with a bit of ribbon
      in his buttonhole. A lady driving in an open carriage encouraged me to
      salute her. She was the wife of the Prince&rsquo;s Minister of Justice. Upon
      what foundation had I been building?
    </p>
    <p>
      A reflection of the ideas possessing me showed Riversley, my undecorated
      home of rough red brick, in the middle of barren heaths. I entered the
      palace, I sent my respects to the prince. In return, the hour of dinner
      was ceremoniously named to me: ceremony damped the air. I had been
      insensible to it before, or so I thought, the weight was now so crushing.
      Arms, emblems, colours, liveries, portraits of princes and princesses of
      the House, of this the warrior, that the seductress, burst into sudden
      light. What had I to do among them?
    </p>
    <p>
      The presence of the living members of the Family was an extreme physical
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment, beholding Ottilia, I counted her but as one of them. She
      welcomed me without restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      We chattered pleasantly at the dinner-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! You missed our French troupe,&rsquo; said the margravine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, resigning them to her. She nodded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And one very pretty little woman they had, I can tell you&mdash;for a
      Frenchwoman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You thought her pretty? Frenchwomen know what to do with their brains and
      their pins, somebody has said.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And exceedingly well said, too. Where is that man Roy? Good things always
      remind me of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was addressed to no one in particular. The man happened to be
      my father, I remembered. A second allusion to him was answered by Prince
      Ernest:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Roy is off to Croatia to enrol some dozens of cheap workmen. The strength
      of those Croats is prodigious, and well looked after they work. He will be
      back in three or four or more days.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have spoilt a good man,&rsquo; rejoined the margravine; &lsquo;and that reminds
      me of a bad one&mdash;a cutthroat. Have you heard of that creature, the
      princess&rsquo;s tutor? Happily cut loose from us, though! He has published a
      book&mdash;a horror! all against Scripture and Divine right! Is there any
      one to defend him now, I should like to ask?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I,&rsquo; said Ottilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gracious me! you have not read the book?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Right through, dear aunt, with all respect to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It &lsquo;s in the house?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is in my study.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I don&rsquo;t wonder! I don&rsquo;t wonder!&rsquo; the margravine exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Best hear what the enemy has to say,&rsquo; Prince Ernest observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excellently argued, papa, supposing that he be an enemy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An enemy as much as the fox is the enemy of the poultry-yard, and the
      hound is the enemy of the fox!&rsquo; said the margravine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I take your illustration, auntie,&rsquo; said Ottilia. &lsquo;He is the enemy of
      chickens, and only does not run before the numbers who bark at him. My
      noble old Professor is a resolute truth-seeker: he raises a light to show
      you the ground you walk on. How is it that you, adoring heroes as you do,
      cannot admire him when he stands alone to support his view of the truth! I
      would I were by him! But I am, whenever I hear him abused.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I daresay you discard nothing that the wretch has taught you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing! nothing!&rsquo; said Ottilia, and made my heart live.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grim and taciturn Baroness Turckems, sitting opposite to her, sighed
      audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has the princess been trying to convert you?&rsquo; the margravine asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Trying? no, madam. Reading? yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My good Turckems! you do not get your share of sleep?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is her Highness the princess who despises sleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See there the way with your free-thinkers! They commence by treading
      under foot the pleasantest half of life, and then they impose their bad
      habits on their victims. Ottilia! Ernest! I do insist upon having lights
      extinguished in the child&rsquo;s apartments by twelve o&rsquo;clock at midnight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Twelve o&rsquo;clock is an extraordinary latitude for children,&rsquo; said Ottilia,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince, with a scarce perceptible degree of emphasis, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Women born to rule must be held exempt from nursery restrictions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the conversation opened to let me in. More than once the margravine
      informed me that I was not the equal of my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;why can&rsquo;t you undertake this detestable coal-mine, and
      let your father disport himself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I suggested that it might be because I was not his equal. She complimented
      me for inheriting a spark of Roy&rsquo;s brilliancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fancied there was a conspiracy to force me back from my pretensions by
      subjecting me to the contemplation of my bare self and actual condition.
      Had there been, I should have suffered from less measured strokes. The
      unconcerted design to humiliate inferiors is commonly successfuller than
      conspiracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince invited me to smoke with him, and talked of our gradual
      subsidence in England to one broad level of rank through the intermixture
      by marriage of our aristocracy, squirearchy, and merchants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here it is not so,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;and no democratic rageings will make it so.
      Rank, with us, is a principle. I suppose you have not read the Professor&rsquo;s
      book? It is powerful&mdash;he is a powerful man. It can do no damage to
      the minds of persons destined by birth to wield authority&mdash;none,
      therefore, to the princess. I would say to you&mdash;avoid it. For those
      who have to carve their way, it is bad. You will enter your Parliament, of
      course? There you have a fine career.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked me what I had made of Chancellor von Redwitz.
    </p>
    <p>
      I perceived that Prince Ernest could be cool and sagacious in repairing
      what his imprudence or blindness had left to occur: that he must have
      enlightened his daughter as to her actual position, and was most
      dexterously and devilishly flattering her worldly good sense by letting it
      struggle and grow, instead of opposing her. His appreciation of her
      intellect was an idolatry; he really confided in it, I knew; and this
      reacted upon her. Did it? My hesitations and doubts, my fantastic raptures
      and despair, my loss of the power to appreciate anything at its right
      value, revealed the madness of loving a princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were preparations for the arrival of an important visitor. The
      margravine spoke of him emphatically. I thought it might be her farcically
      pompous way of announcing my father&rsquo;s return, and looked pleased, I
      suppose, for she added, &lsquo;Do you know Prince Hermann? He spends most of his
      time in Eberhardstadt. He is cousin of the King, a wealthy branch; tant
      soit peu philosophe, a ce qu&rsquo;on dit; a traveller. They say he has a South
      American complexion. I knew him a boy; and his passion is to put together
      what Nature has unpieced, bones of fishes and animals. Il faut passer le
      temps. He adores the Deluge. Anything antediluvian excites him. He can
      tell us the &ldquo;modes&rdquo; of those days; and, if I am not very much misinformed,
      he still expects us to show him the very latest of these. Happily my
      milliner is back from Paris. Ay, and we have fossils in our neighbourhood,
      though, on my honour, I don&rsquo;t know where&mdash;somewhere; the princess can
      guide him, and you can help at the excavations. I am told he would go
      through the crust of earth for the backbone of an idio&mdash;ilio-something-saurus.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I scrutinized Prince Hermann as rarely my observation had dwelt on any
      man. He had the German head, wide, so as seemingly to force out the ears;
      honest, ready, interested eyes in conversation; parched lips; a rather
      tropically-coloured skin; and decidedly the manners of a gentleman to all,
      excepting his retinue of secretaries, valets, and chasseurs&mdash;his
      &lsquo;blacks,&rsquo; he called them. They liked him. One could not help liking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You study much?&rsquo; he addressed the princess at table.
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered: &lsquo;I throw aside books, now you have come to open the earth
      and the sea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      From that time the topics started on every occasion were theirs; the rest
      of us ran at their heels, giving tongue or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      To me Prince Hermann was perfectly courteous. He had made English friends
      on his travels; he preferred English comrades in adventure to any other:
      thought our East Indian empire the most marvellous thing the world had
      seen, and our Indian Government cigars very smokeable upon acquaintance.
      When stirred, he bubbled with anecdote. &lsquo;Not been there,&rsquo; was his reply to
      the margravine&rsquo;s tentatives for gossip of this and that of the German
      Courts. His museum, hunting, and the Opera absorbed and divided his hours.
      I guessed his age to be mounting forty. He seemed robust; he ate
      vigorously. Drinking he conscientiously performed as an accompanying duty,
      and was flushed after dinner, burning for tobacco and a couch for his
      length. Then he talked of the littleness of Europe and the greatness of
      Germany; logical postulates fell in collapse before him. America to
      America, North and South; India to Europe. India was for the land with the
      largest sea-board. Mistress of the Baltic, of the North Sea and the East,
      as eventually she must be, Germany would claim to take India as a matter
      of course, and find an outlet for the energies of the most prolific and
      the toughest of the races of mankind,&mdash;the purest, in fact, the only
      true race, properly so called, out of India, to which it would return as
      to its source, and there create an empire magnificent in force and
      solidity, the actual wedding of East and West; an empire firm on the
      ground and in the blood of the people, instead of an empire of aliens,
      that would bear comparison to a finely fretted cotton-hung palanquin
      balanced on an elephant&rsquo;s back, all depending on the docility of the
      elephant (his description of Great Britain&rsquo;s Indian Empire). &lsquo;And mind
      me,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;the masses of India are in character elephant all over,
      tail to proboscis! servile till they trample you, and not so stupid as
      they look. But you&rsquo;ve done wonders in India, and we can&rsquo;t forget it. Your
      administration of Justice is worth all your battles there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the man: a milder one after the evaporation of his wine in
      speech, and peculiarly moderate on his return, exhaling sandal-wood, to
      the society of the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ottilia danced with Prince Hermann at the grand Ball given in honour of
      him. The wives and daughters of the notables present kept up a buzz of
      comment on his personal advantages, in which, I heard it said, you saw his
      German heart, though he had spent the best years of his life abroad. Much
      court was paid to him by the men. Sarkeld visibly expressed satisfaction.
      One remark, &lsquo;We shall have his museum in the town!&rsquo; left me no doubt upon
      the presumed object of his visit: it was uttered and responded to with a
      depth of sentiment that showed how lively would be the general gratitude
      toward one who should exhilarate the place by introducing cases of
      fish-bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      So little did he think of my presence, that returning from a ride one day,
      he seized and detained the princess&rsquo;s hand. She frowned with pained
      surprise, but unresistingly, as became a young gentlewoman&rsquo;s dignity. Her
      hand was rudely caught and kept in the manner of a boisterous wooer&mdash;a
      Harry the Fifth or lusty Petruchio. She pushed her horse on at a bound.
      Prince Hermann rode up head to head with her gallantly, having now both
      hands free of the reins, like an Indian spearing the buffalo&mdash;it was
      buffalo courtship; and his shout of rallying astonishment at her
      resistance, &lsquo;What? What?&rsquo; rang wildly to heighten the scene, she leaning
      constrained on one side and he bending half his body&rsquo;s length; a strange
      scene for me to witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      They proceeded with old Schwartz at their heels doglike. It became a
      question for me whether I should follow in the bitter track, and further
      the question whether I could let them escape from sight. They wound up the
      roadway, two figures and one following, now dots against the sky, now a
      single movement in the valley, now concealed, buried under billows of
      forest, making the low noising of the leaves an intolerable whisper of
      secresy, and forward I rushed again to see them rounding a belt of firs or
      shadowed by rocks, solitary on shorn fields, once more dipping to the
      forest, and once more emerging, vanishing. When I had grown sure of their
      reappearance from some point of view or other, I spied for them in vain.
      My destiny, whatever it might be, fluttered over them; to see them seemed
      near the knowing of it, and not to see them, deadly. I galloped, so intent
      on the three in the distance, that I did not observe a horseman face
      toward me, on the road: it was Prince Hermann. He raised his hat; I
      stopped short, and he spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Richmond, permit me to apologize to you. I have to congratulate you,
      it appears. I was not aware.&mdash;However, the princess has done me the
      favour to enlighten me. How you will manage, I can&rsquo;t guess, but that is
      not my affair. I am a man of honour; and, on my honour, I conceived that I
      was invited here to decide, as my habit is, on the spot, if I would, or if
      I would not. I speak clearly to you, no doubt. There could be no
      hesitation in the mind of a man of sense. My way is prompt and blunt; I am
      sorry I gave you occasion to reflect on it. There! I have been deceived&mdash;deceived
      myself, let&rsquo;s say. Sharp methods play the devil with you now and then. To
      speak the truth,&mdash;perhaps you won&rsquo;t care to listen to it,&mdash;family
      arrangements are the best; take my word for it, they are the best. And in
      the case of princesses of the Blood!&mdash;Why, look you, I happen to be
      suitable. It &lsquo;s a matter of chance, like your height, complexion,
      constitution. One is just what one is born to be, eh? You have your
      English notions, I my German; but as a man of the world in the bargain,
      and &ldquo;gentleman,&rdquo; I hope, I should say, that to take a young princess&rsquo;s
      fancy, and drag her from her station is not&mdash;of course, you know that
      the actual value of the title goes if she steps down? Very well. But
      enough said; I thought I was in a clear field. We are used to having our
      way cleared for us, nous autres. I will not detain you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We saluted gravely, and I rode on at a mechanical pace, discerning by
      glimpses the purport of what I had heard, without drawing warmth from it.
      The man&rsquo;s outrageously royal way of wooing, in contempt of minor presences
      and flimsy sentiment, made me jealous of him, notwithstanding his
      overthrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in the mood to fall entirely into my father&rsquo;s hands, as I did by
      unbosoming myself to him for the first time since my heart had been under
      the charm. Fresh from a rapid course of travel, and with the sense of
      laying the prince under weighty obligations, he made light of my
      perplexity, and at once delivered himself bluntly: &lsquo;She plights her hand
      to you in the presence of our good Peterborough.&rsquo; His plans were shaped on
      the spot. &lsquo;We start for England the day after to-morrow to urge on the
      suit, Richie. Our Peterborough is up at the chateau. The Frau
      Feldmarschall honours him with a farewell invitation: you have a private
      interview with the princess at midnight in the library, where you are
      accustomed to read, as a student of books should, my boy at a touch of the
      bell, or mere opening of the door, I see that Peterborough comes to you.
      It will not be a ceremony, but a binding of you both by your word of
      honour before a ghostly gentleman.&rsquo; He informed me that his foresight had
      enlisted and detained Peterborough for this particular moment and
      identical piece of duty, which seemed possible, and in a singular manner
      incited me to make use of Peterborough. For the princess still denied me
      the look of love&rsquo;s intelligence, she avoided me, she still kept to the
      riddle, and my delicacy went so far that I was restrained from writing. I
      agreed with my father that we could not remain in Germany; but how could I
      quit the field and fly to England on such terms? I composed the flattest
      letter ever written, requesting the princess to meet me about midnight in
      the library, that I might have the satisfaction of taking my leave of her;
      and this done, my spirits rose, and it struck me my father was practically
      wise, and I looked on Peterborough as an almost supernatural being. If
      Ottilia refused to come, at least I should know my fate. Was I not bound
      in manly honour to be to some degree adventurous?
    </p>
    <p>
      So I reasoned in exclamations, being, to tell truth, tired of seeming to
      be what I was not quite, of striving to become what I must have divined
      that I never could quite attain to. So my worthier, or ideal, self fell
      away from me. I was no longer devoted to be worthy of a woman&rsquo;s love, but
      consenting to the plot to entrap a princess. I was somewhat influenced,
      too, by the consideration, which I regarded as a glimpse of practical
      wisdom, that Prince Ernest was guilty of cynical astuteness in retaining
      me as his guest under manifold disadvantages. Personal pride stood up in
      arms, and my father&rsquo;s exuberant spirits fanned it. He dwelt loudly on his
      services to the prince, and his own importance and my heirship to mighty
      riches. He made me almost believe that Prince Ernest hesitated about
      rejecting me; nor did it appear altogether foolish to think so, or why was
      I at the palace? I had no head for reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father diverted me by levelling the whole battery of his comic mind
      upon Peterborough, who had a heap of manuscript, directed against
      heretical German theologians, to pack up for publication in his more
      congenial country: how different, he ejaculated, from this nest&mdash;this
      forest of heresy, where pamphlets and critical essays were issued without
      let or hindrance, and, as far as he could see, no general reprobation of
      the Press, such as would most undoubtedly, with one voice, hail any
      strange opinions in our happy land at home! Whether he really understood
      the function my father prepared him for, I cannot say. The invitation to
      dine and pass a night at the lake-palace flattered him immensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went up to the chateau to fetch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of woe was on Peterborough&rsquo;s countenance when we descended at the
      palace portals: he had forgotten his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall smoke one of the prince&rsquo;s,&rsquo; my father said. Peterborough
      remarked to me,&mdash;&lsquo;We shall have many things to talk over in England.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No tobacco allowed on the premises at Riversley, I &lsquo;m afraid,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed, and bade me jocosely to know that he regarded tobacco as just
      one of the consolations of exiles and bachelors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Peterborough, my good friend, you are a hero!&rsquo; cried my father. &lsquo;He
      divorces tobacco to marry!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Permit me,&rsquo; Peterborough interposed, with an ingenuous pretension to
      subtle waggery, in itself very comical,&mdash;&lsquo;permit me; no legitimate
      union has taken place between myself and tobacco!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He puts an end to the illegitimate union between himself and tobacco that
      he may marry according to form!&rsquo; cried my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      We entered the palace merrily, and presently Peterborough, who had worn a
      studious forehead in the midst of his consenting laughter, observed,
      &lsquo;Well, you know, there is more in that than appears on the surface.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His sweet simpleton air of profundity convulsed me. I handed my father the
      letter addressed to the princess to entrust it to the charge of one of the
      domestics, thinking carelessly at the time that Ottilia now stood free to
      make appointments and receive communications, and moreover that I was too
      proud to condescend to subterfuge, except this minor one, in consideration
      for her, of making it appear that my father, and not I, was in
      communication with her. My fit of laughter clung. I dressed chuckling. The
      margravine was not slow to notice and comment on my hilarious readiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Roy,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you have given your son spirit. One sees he has your
      blood when you have been with him an hour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The season has returned, if your Highness will let it be Spring,&rsquo; said my
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Far fetched!&mdash;from the Lower Danube!&rsquo; she ejaculated in mock scorn
      to excite his sprightliness, and they fell upon a duologue as good as wit
      for the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Hermann had gone. His departure was mentioned with the ordinary
      commonplaces of regret. Ottilia was unembarrassed, both in speaking of him
      and looking at me. We had the Court physician and his wife at table,
      Chancellor von Redwitz and his daughter, and General Happenwyll, chief of
      the prince&rsquo;s contingent, a Prussian at heart, said to be a good officer on
      the strength of a military book of some sort that he had full leisure to
      compose. The Chancellor&rsquo;s daughter and Baroness Turckems enclosed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was questioned by the baroness as to the cause of my father&rsquo;s unexpected
      return. &lsquo;He is generally opportune,&rsquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He goes with me to England,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! he goes,&rsquo; said she; and asked why we were honoured with the presence
      of Mr. Peterborough that evening. There had always been a smouldering
      hostility between her and my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my surprise, the baroness spoke of Ottilia by her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ottilia must have mountain air. These late hours destroy her complexion.
      Active exercise by day and proper fatigue by night time&mdash;that is my
      prescription.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The princess,&rsquo; I replied, envying Peterborough, who was placed on one
      side of her, &lsquo;will benefit, I am sure, from mountain air. Does she read
      excessively? The sea&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The sea I pronounce bad for her&mdash;unwholesome,&rsquo; returned the
      baroness. &lsquo;It is damp.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Damp,&rsquo; she reiterated. &lsquo;The vapours, I am convinced, affect mind and
      body. That excursion in the yacht did her infinite mischief. The mountains
      restored her. They will again, take my word for it. Now take you my word
      for it, they will again. She is not too strong in constitution, but in
      order to prescribe accurately one must find out whether there is seated
      malady. To ride out in the night instead of reposing! To drive on and on,
      and not reappear till the night of the next day&mdash;I ask you, is it
      sensible? Does it not approach mania?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The princess&mdash;?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ottilia has done that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Baroness, can I believe you?&mdash;and alone?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A marvellous twinkle of shuffle appeared in the small slate-coloured eyes
      I looked at under their roofing of thick black eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alone,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;That is, she was precautious to have her giant to
      protect her from violence. There you have a glimmering of reason in her;
      and all of it that I can see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old Schwartz is a very faithful servant,&rsquo; said I, thinking that she
      resembled the old Warhead in visage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A dog&rsquo;s obedience to the master&rsquo;s whims you call faithfulness! Hem!&rsquo; The
      baroness coughed dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I whispered: &lsquo;Does Prince Ernest&mdash;is he aware?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are aware,&rsquo; retorted the baroness, &lsquo;that what a man idolizes he won&rsquo;t
      see flaw in. Remember, I am something here, or I am nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The enigmatical remark was received by me decorously as a piece of merited
      chastisement. Nodding with gravity, I expressed regrets that the sea did
      not please her, otherwise I could have offered her a yacht for a cruise.
      She nodded stiffly. Her mouth shut up a smile, showing more of the door
      than the ray. The dinner, virtually a German supper, ended in general
      conversation on political affairs, preceded and supported by a discussion
      between the Prussian-hearted General and the Austrian-hearted margravine.
      Prince Ernest, true to his view that diplomacy was the weapon of minor
      sovereigns, held the balance, with now a foot in one scale, now in the
      other; a politic proceeding, so long as the rival powers passively consent
      to be weighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We trifled with music, made our bow to the ladies, and changed garments
      for the smoking-room. Prince Ernest smoked his one cigar among guests. The
      General, the Chancellor, and the doctor, knew the signal for retirement,
      and rose simultaneously with the discharge of his cigar-end in sparks on
      the unlit logwood pile. My father and Mr. Peterborough kept their chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, I felt with relief, no plot, for nothing had been definitely
      assented to by me. I received Prince Ernest&rsquo;s proffer of his hand, on
      making my adieux to him, with a passably clear conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went out to the library. A man came in for orders; I had none to give.
      He saw that the shutters were fixed and the curtains down, examined my
      hand-lamp, and placed lamps on the reading-desk and mantel-piece. Bronze
      busts of sages became my solitary companions. The room was long, low and
      dusky, voluminously and richly hung with draperies at the farther end,
      where a table stood for the prince to jot down memoranda, and a sofa to
      incline him to the relaxation of romance-reading. A door at this end led
      to the sleeping apartments of the West wing of the palace. Where I sat the
      student had ranges of classical volumes in prospect and classic heads; no
      other decoration to the walls. I paced to and fro and should have flung
      myself on the sofa but for a heap of books there covered from dust,
      perhaps concealed, that the yellow Parisian volumes, of which I caught
      sight of some new dozen, might not be an attraction to the eyes of
      chance-comers. At the lake-palace the prince frequently gave audience
      here. He had said to me, when I stated my wish to read in the library,
      &lsquo;You keep to the classical department?&rsquo; I thought it possible he might not
      like the coloured volumes to be inspected; I had no taste for a perusal of
      them. I picked up one that fell during my walk, and flung it back, and
      disturbed a heap under cover, for more fell, and there I let them lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ottilia did not keep me waiting.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV. THE SCENE IN THE LAKE-PALACE LIBRARY
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was humming the burden of Gothe&rsquo;s Zigeunerlied, a favourite one with me
      whenever I had too much to think of, or nothing. A low rush of sound from
      the hall-doorway swung me on my heel, and I saw her standing with a silver
      lamp raised in her right hand to the level of her head, as if she expected
      to meet obscurity. A thin blue Indian scarf mufed her throat and
      shoulders. Her hair was loosely knotted. The lamp&rsquo;s full glow illumined
      and shadowed her. She was like a statue of Twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went up to her quickly, and closed the door, saying, &lsquo;You have come&rsquo;; my
      voice was not much above a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked distrustfully down the length of the room; &lsquo;You were speaking
      to some one?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were speaking.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To myself, then, I suppose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I remembered and repeated the gipsy burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled faintly and said it was the hour for Anna and Ursel and Kith
      and Liese to be out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hands were gloved, a small matter to tell of.
    </p>
    <p>
      We heard the portico-sentinel challenged and relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Midnight,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied: &lsquo;You were not definite in your directions about the minutes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feared to name midnight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lest the appointment of midnight&mdash;I lose my knowledge of you!&mdash;should
      make you reflect, frighten you. You see, I am inventing a reason; I really
      cannot tell why, if it was not that I hoped to have just those few minutes
      more of you. And now they&rsquo;re gone. I would not have asked you but that I
      thought you free to act.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you come freely?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; belongs to every grant of freedom.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I understand: your judgement was against it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be comforted,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;it is your right to bid me come, if you think
      fit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the sofa-volumes fell. She caught her breath; and smiled at her
      foolish alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her that it was my intention to start for England in the morning;
      that this was the only moment I had, and would be the last interview: my
      rights, if I possessed any, and I was not aware that I did, I threw down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You throw down one end of the chain,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the name of heaven, then,&rsquo; cried I, &lsquo;release yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &lsquo;That is not my meaning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Note the predicament of a lover who has a piece of dishonesty lurking in
      him. My chilled self-love had certainly the right to demand the
      explanation of her coldness, and I could very well guess that a word or
      two drawn from the neighbourhood of the heart would fetch a warmer current
      to unlock the ice between us, but feeling the coldness I complained of to
      be probably a suspicion, I fixed on the suspicion as a new and deeper
      injury done to my loyal love for her, and armed against that I dared not
      take an initiative for fear of unexpectedly justifying it by betraying
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, supposing her inclination to have become diverted, I was ready
      frankly to release her with one squeeze of hands and take all the pain of
      she pain, and I said: &lsquo;Pray, do not speak of chains.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But they exist. Things cannot be undone for us two by words.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The tremble as of a strung wire in the strenuous pitch of her voice seemed
      to say she was not cold, though her gloved hand resting its finger-ends on
      the table, her restrained attitude, her very calm eyes, declared the
      reverse. This and that sensation beset me in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shrank oddly from uttering one another&rsquo;s Christian name. I was the
      first with it; my &lsquo;Ottilia!&rsquo; brought soon after &lsquo;Harry&rsquo; on her lips, and
      an atmosphere about us much less Arctic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ottilia, you have told me you wish me to go to England.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall be friends.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Harry; we cannot be quite divided; we have that knowledge for our
      present happiness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The happy knowledge that we may have our bone to gnaw when food&rsquo;s denied.
      It is something. One would like possibly, after expulsion out of Eden, to
      climb the gates to see how the trees grow there. What I cannot imagine is
      the forecasting of any joy in the privilege.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By nature or system, then, you are more impatient than I, for I can,&rsquo; 
      said Ottilia. She added: &lsquo;So much of your character I divined early. It
      was part of my reason for wishing you to work. You will find that hard
      work in England&mdash;but why should I preach to you Harry, you have
      called me here for some purpose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must have detained you already too long.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Time is not the offender. Since I have come, the evil&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Evil? Are not your actions free?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Patience, my friend. The freer my actions, the more am I bound to
      deliberate on them. I have the habit of thinking that my deliberations are
      not in my sex&rsquo;s fashion of taking counsel of the nerves and the blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, Harry, I should not have come but for my acknowledgement of your
      right to bid me come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know, princess, that in honouring me with your attachment, you
      imperil your sovereign rank?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What next?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Except that it is grievously in peril, nothing!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you known it all along?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dimly-scarcely. To some extent I knew it, but it did not stand out in
      broad daylight. I have been learning the world&rsquo;s wisdom recently. Would
      you have had me neglect it? Surely much is due to my father? My relatives
      have claims on me. Our princely Houses have. My country has.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, princess, if you are pleading&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you think that I am?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The splendour of her high nature burst on me with a shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could have fallen to kiss her feet, and I said indifferently: &lsquo;Not
      pleading, only it is evident the claims&mdash;I hate myself for bringing
      you in antagonism with them. Yes, and I have been learning some worldly
      wisdom; I wish for your sake it had not been so late. What made me
      overleap the proper estimate of your rank! I can&rsquo;t tell; but now that I
      know better the kind of creature&mdash;the man who won your esteem when
      you knew less of the world!&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush! I have an interest in him, and do not suffer him to be spurned,&rsquo; 
      Ottilia checked me. &lsquo;I, too, know him better, and still, if he is dragged
      down I am in the dust; if he is abused the shame is mine.&rsquo; Her face
      bloomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sweet warmth of colour was transfused through my veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall part in a few minutes. I have a mind to beg a gift of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Name it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That glove.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She made her hand bare and gave me, not the glove, but the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! but this I cannot keep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you have everything spoken?&rsquo; she said, in a tone that would have
      been reproachful had not tenderness melted it. &lsquo;There should be a spirit
      between us, Harry, to spare the task. You do keep it, if you choose. I
      have some little dread of being taken for a madwoman, and more&mdash;an
      actual horror of behaving ungratefully to my generous father. He has
      proved that he can be indulgent, most trusting and considerate for his
      daughter, though he is a prince; my duty is to show him that I do not
      forget I am a princess. I owe my rank allegiance when he forgets his on my
      behalf, my friend! You are young. None but an inexperienced girl
      hoodwinked by her tricks of intuition, would have dreamed you superior to
      the passions of other men. I was blind; I am regretful&mdash;take my word
      as you do my hand&mdash;for no one&rsquo;s sake but my father&rsquo;s. You and I are
      bound fast; only, help me that the blow may be lighter for him; if I
      descend from the place I was born to, let me tell him it is to occupy one
      I am fitted for, or should not at least feel my Family&rsquo;s deep blush in
      filling. To be in the midst of life in your foremost England is, in my
      imagination, very glorious. Harry, I remember picturing to myself when I
      reflected upon your country&rsquo;s history&mdash;perhaps a year after I had
      seen the two &ldquo;young English gentlemen,&rdquo; that you touch the morning and
      evening star, and wear them in your coronet, and walk with the sun West
      and East! Child&rsquo;s imagery; but the impression does not wear off. If I rail
      at England, it is the anger of love. I fancy I have good and great things
      to speak to the people through you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There she stopped. The fervour she repressed in speech threw a glow over
      her face, like that on a frosty bare autumn sky after sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pressed my lips to her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our silence another of the fatal yellow volumes thumped the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked into my eyes and asked,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have we been speaking before a witness?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So thoroughly had she renovated me, that I accused and reproved the
      lurking suspicion with a soft laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beloved! I wish we had been.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it might be,&rsquo; she said, divining me and musing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How? What do you ask?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The look on my face alarmed her. I was breathless and colourless, with the
      heart of a hawk eyeing his bird&mdash;a fox, would be the truer
      comparison, but the bird was noble, not one that cowered. Her beauty and
      courage lifted me into high air, in spite of myself, and it was a huge
      weight of greed that fell away from me when I said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would not urge it for an instant. Consider&mdash;if you had just
      plighted your hand in mine before a witness!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My hand is in yours; my word to you is enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Enough. My thanks to heaven for it! But consider&mdash;a pledge of
      fidelity that should be my secret angel about me in trouble and trial; my
      wedded soul! She cannot falter, she is mine for ever, she guides me, holds
      me to work, inspirits me!&mdash;she is secure from temptation, from
      threats, from everything&mdash;nothing can touch, nothing move her, she is
      mine! I mean, an attested word, a form, that is&mdash;a betrothal. For me
      to say&mdash;my beloved and my betrothed! You hear that? Beloved! is a
      lonely word:&mdash;betrothed! carries us joined up to death. Would you?&mdash;I
      do but ask to know that you would. To-morrow I am loose in the world, and
      there &lsquo;s a darkness in the thought of it almost too terrible. Would you?&mdash;one
      sworn word that gives me my bride, let men do what they may! I go then
      singing to battle&mdash;sure!&mdash;Remember, it is but the question
      whether you would.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harry, I would, and will,&rsquo; she said, her lips shuddering&mdash;&lsquo;wait&rsquo;&mdash;for
      a cry of joy escaped me&mdash;&lsquo;I will look you me in the eyes and tell me
      you have a doubt of me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked: she swam in a mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had our full draught of the divine self-oblivion which floated those
      ghosts of the two immortal lovers through the bounds of their purgatorial
      circle, and for us to whom the minutes were ages, as for them to whom all
      time was unmarked, the power of supreme love swept out circumstance. Such
      embraces cast the soul beyond happiness, into no known region of sadness,
      but we drew apart sadly, even as that involved pair of bleeding
      recollections looked on the life lost to them. I knew well what a height
      she dropped from when the senses took fire. She raised me to learn how
      little of fretful thirst and its reputed voracity remains with love when
      it has been met midway in air by a winged mate able to sustain, unable to
      descend farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was before a witness, though unviewed by us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farewell had come. Her voice was humbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never, I said, delighting in the now conscious bravery of her eyes
      engaging mine, shadowy with the struggle, I would never doubt her, and I
      renounced all pledges. To be clear in my own sight as well as in hers, I
      made mention of the half-formed conspiracy to obtain her plighted troth in
      a binding manner. It was not necessary for me to excuse myself; she did
      that, saying, &lsquo;Could there be a greater proof of my darling&rsquo;s unhappiness?
      I am to blame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We closed hands for parting. She hesitated and asked if my father was
      awake; then promptly to my answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will see him. I have treated you ill. I have exacted too much patience.
      The suspicion was owing to a warning I had this evening, Harry; a silly
      warning to beware of snares; and I had no fear of them, believe me, though
      for some moments, and without the slightest real desire to be guarded, I
      fancied Harry&rsquo;s father was overhearing me. He is your father, dearest:
      fetch him to me. My father will hear of this from my lips&mdash;why not
      he? Ah! did I suspect you ever so little? I will atone for it; not atone,
      I will make it my pleasure; it is my pride that has hurt you both. O my
      lover! my lover! Dear head, dear eyes! Delicate and noble that you are! my
      own stronger soul! Where was my heart? Is it sometimes dead, or sleeping?
      But you can touch it to life. Look at me&mdash;I am yours. I consent, I
      desire it; I will see him. I will be bound. The heavier the chains, oh!
      the better for me. What am I, to be proud of anything not yours, Harry?
      and I that have passed over to you! I will see him at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A third in the room cried out, &lsquo;No, not that&mdash;you do not!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The tongue was German and struck on us like a roll of unfriendly musketry
      before we perceived the enemy. &lsquo;Princess Ottilia! you remember your
      dignity or I defend you and it, think of me what you will!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Baroness Turckems, desperately entangled by the sofa-covering, rushed into
      the ray of the lamps and laid her hand on the bell-rope. In a minute we
      had an alarm sounding, my father was among us, there was a mad play of
      chatter, and we stood in the strangest nightmare-light that ever ended an
      interview of lovers.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI. HOMEWARD AND HOME AGAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      The room was in flames, Baroness Turckems plucking at the bell-rope, my
      father looking big and brilliant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold hand!&rsquo; he shouted to the frenzied baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She counter-shouted; both of them stamped feet; the portico sentinel
      struck the butt of his musket on the hall-doors; bell answered bell along
      the upper galleries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Foolish woman, be silent!&rsquo; cried my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Incendiary!&rsquo; she half-shrieked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the princess, begging her to retire, but she stared at him,
      and I too, after having seen him deliberately apply the flame of her lamp
      to the curtains, deemed him mad. He was perfectly self-possessed, and
      said, &lsquo;This will explain the bell!&rsquo; and fetched a deep breath, and again
      urged the princess to retire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peterborough was the only one present who bethought him of doing fireman&rsquo;s
      duty. The risk looked greater than it was. He had but to tear the lighted
      curtains down and trample on them. Suddenly the baroness called out, &lsquo;The
      man is right! Come with me, princess; escape, your Highness, escape! And
      you,&rsquo; she addressed me&mdash;&lsquo;you rang the bell, you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To repair your error, baroness,&rsquo; said my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have my conscience pure; have you?&rsquo; she retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed and said, &lsquo;The fire will also excuse your presence on the spot,
      baroness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thank my God I am not so cool as you,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your warmth&rsquo;&mdash;he bent to her&mdash;&lsquo;shall always be your apology,
      baroness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the curtains extinguished, Ottilia withdrew. She gave me no glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this occurred before the night-porter, who was going his rounds, could
      reach the library. Lacqueys and maids were soon at his heels. My father
      met Prince Ernest with a florid story of a reckless student, either asleep
      or too anxious to secure a particular volume, and showed his usual
      consideration by not asking me to verify the narrative. With that, and
      with high praise of Peterborough, as to whose gallantry I heard him
      deliver a very circumstantial account, he, I suppose, satisfied the
      prince&rsquo;s curiosity, and appeased him, the damage being small compared with
      the uproar. Prince Ernest questioned two or three times, &lsquo;What set him
      ringing so furiously?&rsquo; My father made some reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ottilia&rsquo;s cloud-pale windows were the sole greeting I had from her on my
      departure early next morning, far wretcheder than if I had encountered a
      misfortune. It was impossible for me to deny that my father had shielded
      the princess: she would never have run for a menace. As he remarked, the
      ringing of the bell would not of itself have forced her to retreat, and
      the nature of the baroness&rsquo;s alarm demanded nothing less than a
      conflagration to account for it to the household. But I felt humiliated on
      Ottilia&rsquo;s behalf, and enraged on my own. And I had, I must confess, a
      touch of fear of a man who could unhesitatingly go to extremities, as he
      had done, by summoning fire to the rescue. He assured me that moments such
      as those inspired him and were the pride of his life, and he was convinced
      that, upon reflection, &lsquo;I should rise to his pitch.&rsquo; He deluded himself
      with the idea of his having foiled Baroness Turckems, nor did I choose to
      contest it, though it struck me that she was too conclusively the foiler.
      She must have intercepted the letter for the princess. I remembered acting
      carelessly in handing it to my father for him to consign it to one of the
      domestics, and he passed it on with a flourish. Her place of concealment
      was singularly well selected under the sofa-cover, and the little heaps of
      paper-bound volumes. I do not fancy she meant to rouse the household; her
      notion probably was to terrorize the princess, that she might compel her
      to quit my presence. In rushing to the bell-rope, her impetuosity sent her
      stumbling on it with force, and while threatening to ring, and meaning
      merely to threaten, she rang; and as it was not a retractable act, she
      continued ringing, and the more violently upon my father&rsquo;s appearance.
      Catching sight of Peterborough at his heels, she screamed a word
      equivalent to a clergyman. She had lost her discretion, but not her wits.
    </p>
    <p>
      For any one save a lover&mdash;thwarted as I was, and perturbed by the
      shadow falling on the princess&mdash;my father&rsquo;s Aplomb and promptness in
      conjuring a check to what he assumed to be a premeditated piece of villany
      on the part of Baroness Turckems, might have seemed tolerably worthy of
      admiration. Me the whole scene affected as if it had burnt my skin. I
      loathed that picture of him, constantly present to me, of his shivering
      the glass of Ottilia&rsquo;s semi-classical night-lamp, gravely asking her
      pardon, and stretching the flame to the curtain, with large eyes blazing
      on the baroness. The stupid burlesque majesty of it was unendurable to
      thought. Nevertheless, I had to thank him for shielding Ottilia, and I had
      to brood on the fact that I had drawn her into a situation requiring such
      a shield. He, meanwhile, according to his habit, was engaged in reviewing
      the triumphs to come. &lsquo;We have won a princess!&rsquo; And what England would
      say, how England would look, when, on a further journey, I brought my
      princess home, entirely occupied his imagination, to my excessive torture&mdash;a
      state of mind for which it was impossible to ask his mercy. His sole link
      with the past appeared to be this notion that he had planned all the good
      things in store for us. Consequently I was condemned to hear of the
      success of the plot, until&mdash;for I had not the best of consciences&mdash;I
      felt my hand would be spell-bound in the attempt to write to the princess;
      and with that sense of incapacity I seemed to be cut loose from her,
      drifting back into the desolate days before I saw her wheeled in her
      invalid chair along the sands and my life knew sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      But whatever the mood of our affections, so it is with us island
      wanderers: we cannot gaze over at England, knowing the old country to be
      close under the sea-line, and not hail it, and partly forget ourselves in
      the time that was. The smell of sea-air made me long for the white cliffs,
      the sight of the white cliffs revived pleasant thoughts of Riversley, and
      thoughts of Riversley thoughts of Janet, which were singularly and
      refreshingly free from self-accusations. Some love for my home, similar to
      what one may have for Winter, came across me, and some appreciation of
      Janet as well, in whose society was sure to be at least myself, a creature
      much reduced in altitude, but without the cramped sensations of a man on a
      monument. My hearty Janet! I thanked her then for seeing me of my natural
      height.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hours after parting with my father in London, I lay down to sleep in
      my old home, feeling as if I had thrown off a coat of armour. I awoke with
      a sailor&rsquo;s song on my lips. Looking out of window at the well-known
      features of the heaths and dark firs, and waning oak copses, and the
      shadowy line of the downs stretching their long whale backs South to West,
      it struck me that I had been barely alive of late. Indeed one who consents
      to live as I had done, in a hope and a retrospect, will find his life
      slipping between the two, like the ships under the striding Colossus. I
      shook myself, braced myself, and saluted every one at the breakfast table
      with the frankness of Harry Richmond. Congratulated on my splendid
      spirits, I was confirmed in the idea that I enjoyed them, though I knew of
      something hollow which sent an echo through me at intervals. Janet had
      become a fixed inmate of the house. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve bought her, and I shall keep
      her; she&rsquo;s the apple of my eye,&rsquo; said the squire, adding with
      characteristic scrupulousness, &lsquo;if apple&rsquo;s female.&rsquo; I asked her whether
      she had heard from Temple latterly. &lsquo;No; dear little fellow!&rsquo; cried she,
      and I saw in a twinkling what it was that the squire liked in her, and
      liked it too. I caught sight of myself, as through a rift of cloud,
      trotting home from the hunt to a glad, frank, unpretending mate, with just
      enough of understanding to look up to mine. For a second or so it was
      pleasing, as a glance out of his library across hill and dale will be to a
      strained student. Our familiarity sanctioned a comment on the growth of
      her daughter-of-the-regiment moustache, the faintest conceivable
      suggestion of a shadow on her soft upper lip, which a poet might have
      feigned to have fallen from her dark thick eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t mean to say, Hal, it&rsquo;s not to your taste?&rsquo; said the
      squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I, turning an eye on my aunt Dorothy, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve loved it all my
      life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire stared at me to make sure of this, muttered that it was to his
      mind a beauty, and that it was nothing more on Janet&rsquo;s lip than down on a
      flower, bloom on a plum. The poetical comparisons had the effect of
      causing me to examine her critically. She did not raise a spark of
      poetical sentiment in my bosom. She had grown a tall young woman, firmly
      built, light of motion, graceful perhaps; but it was not the grace of
      grace: the grace of simplicity, rather. She talked vivaciously and
      frankly, and gave (to friends) her whole eyes and a fine animation in
      talking; and her voice was a delight to friends; there was always the full
      ring of Janet in it, and music also. She still lifted her lip when she
      expressed contempt or dislike of persons; nor was she cured of her trick
      of frowning. She was as ready as ever to be flattered; that was evident.
      My grandfather&rsquo;s praise of her she received with a rewarding look back of
      kindness; she was not discomposed by flattery, and threw herself into no
      postures, nor blushed very deeply. &lsquo;Thank you for perceiving my merits,&rsquo; 
      she seemed to say; and to be just I should add that one could fancy her
      saying, you see them because you love me. She wore her hair in a plain
      knot, peculiarly neatly rounded away from the temples, which sometimes
      gave to a face not aquiline a look of swiftness. The face was mobile,
      various, not at all suggestive of bad temper, in spite of her frowns. The
      profile of it was less assuring than the front, because of the dark
      eyebrows&rsquo; extension and the occasional frown, but that was not shared by
      the mouth, which was, I admitted to myself, a charming bow, running to a
      length at the corners like her eyebrows, quick with smiles. The corners of
      the mouth would often be in movement, setting dimples at work in her
      cheek, while the brows remained fixed, and thus at times a tender
      meditative air was given her that I could not think her own. Upon what
      could she possibly reflect? She had not a care, she had no education, she
      could hardly boast an idea&mdash;two at a time I was sure she never had
      entertained. The sort of wife for a fox-hunting lord, I summed up, and
      hoped he would be a good fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peterborough was plied by the squire for a description of German women.
      Blushing and shooting a timid look from under his pendulous eyelids at my
      aunt, indicating that he was prepared to go the way of tutors at
      Riversley, he said he really had not much observed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re a whitey-brown sort of women, aren&rsquo;t they?&rsquo; the squire questioned
      him, &lsquo;with tow hair and fish eyes, high o&rsquo; the shoulder, bony, and a towel
      skin and gone teeth, so I&rsquo;ve heard tell. I&rsquo;ve heard that&rsquo;s why the men
      have all taken to their beastly smoking.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Peterborough ejaculated: &lsquo;Indeed! sir, really!&rsquo; He assured my aunt that
      German ladies were most agreeable, cultivated persons, extremely
      domesticated, retiring; the encomiums of the Roman historian were as well
      deserved by them in the present day as they had been in the past;
      decidedly, on the whole, Peterborough would call them a virtuous race.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do they let the men smoke, then?&rsquo; said the squire. &lsquo;A pretty style o&rsquo; 
      courtship. Come, sit by my hearth, ma&rsquo;am; I &lsquo;ll be your chimney&mdash;faugh!
      dirty rascals!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet said: &lsquo;I rather like the smell of cigars.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like what you please, my dear&mdash;he&rsquo;ll be a lucky dog,&rsquo; the squire
      approved her promptly, and asked me if I smoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not a stranger to the act, I confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well&rsquo;&mdash;he took refuge in practical philosophy&mdash;&lsquo;a man must
      bring some dirt home from every journey: only don&rsquo;t smoke me out, mercy&rsquo;s
      sake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a hint of Janet&rsquo;s influence with him, and of what he expected
      from my return to Riversley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peterborough informed me that he suffered persecution over the last
      glasses of Port in the evening, through the squire&rsquo;s persistent inquiries
      as to whether a woman had anything to do with my staying so long abroad.
      &lsquo;A lady, sir?&rsquo; quoth Peterborough. &lsquo;Lady, if you like,&rsquo; rejoined the
      squire. &lsquo;You parsons and petticoats must always mince the meat to hash the
      fact.&rsquo; Peterborough defended his young friend Harry&rsquo;s moral reputation,
      and was amazed to hear that the squire did not think highly of a man&rsquo;s
      chastity. The squire acutely chagrined the sensitive gentleman by drawling
      the word after him, and declaring that he tossed that kind of thing into
      the women&rsquo;s wash-basket. Peterborough, not without signs of indignation,
      protesting, the squire asked him point-blank if he supposed that Old
      England had been raised to the head of the world by such as he. In fine,
      he favoured Peterborough with a lesson in worldly views. &lsquo;But these,&rsquo; 
      Peterborough said to me, &lsquo;are not the views, dear Harry&mdash;if they are
      the views of ladies of any description, which I take leave to doubt&mdash;not
      the views of the ladies you and I would esteem. For instance, the ladies
      of this household.&rsquo; My aunt Dorothy&rsquo;s fate was plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply to my grandfather&rsquo;s renewed demand to know whether any one of
      those High-Dutch women had got hold of me, Peterborough said: &lsquo;Mr.
      Beltham, the only lady of whom it could be suspected that my friend Harry
      regarded her with more than ordinary admiration was Hereditary-Princess of
      one of the ancient princely Houses of Germany.&rsquo; My grandfather thereupon
      said, &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; pushed the wine, and was stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peterborough chuckled over this &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; and the stoppage of further
      questions, while acknowledging that the luxury of a pipe would help to
      make him more charitable. He enjoyed the Port of his native land, but he
      did, likewise, feel the want of one whiff or so of the less restrictive
      foreigner&rsquo;s pipe; and he begged me to note the curiosity of our worship of
      aristocracy and royalty; and we, who were such slaves to rank, and such
      tyrants in our own households,&mdash;we Britons were the great sticklers
      for freedom! His conclusion was, that we were not logical. We would have a
      Throne, which we would not allow the liberty to do anything to make it
      worthy of rational veneration: we would have a peerage, of which we were
      so jealous that it formed almost an assembly of automatons; we would have
      virtuous women, only for them to be pursued by immoral men. Peterborough
      feared, he must say, that we were an inconsequent people. His residence
      abroad had so far unhinged him; but a pipe would have stopped his
      complainings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moved, perhaps, by generous wine, in concert with his longing for tobacco,
      he dropped an observation of unwonted shrewdness; he said: &lsquo;The squire, my
      dear Harry, a most honourable and straightforward country gentleman, and
      one of our very wealthiest, is still, I would venture to suggest, an
      example of old blood that requires&mdash;I study race&mdash;varying,
      modifying, one might venture to say, correcting; and really, a friend with
      more privileges than I possess, would or should throw him a hint that no
      harm has been done to the family by an intermixture... old blood does
      occasionally need it&mdash;you know I study blood&mdash;it becomes too
      coarse, or, in some cases, too fine. The study of the mixture of blood is
      probably one of our great physical problems.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Peterborough commended me to gratitude for the imaginative and chivalrous
      element bestowed on me by a father that was other than a country squire;
      one who could be tolerant of innocent habits, and not of guilty ones&mdash;a
      further glance at the interdicted pipe. I left him almost whimpering for
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contemplation of the curious littleness of the lives of men and women
      lived in this England of ours, made me feel as if I looked at them out of
      a palace balcony-window; for no one appeared to hope very much or to fear;
      people trotted in their different kinds of harness; and I was amused to
      think of my heart going regularly in imitation of those about me. I was in
      a princely state of mind indeed, not disinclined for a time to follow the
      general course of life, while despising it. An existence without colour,
      without anxious throbbing, without salient matter for thought, challenged
      contempt. But it was exceedingly funny. My aunt Dorothy, the squire, and
      Janet submitted to my transparent inward laughter at them, patiently
      waiting for me to share their contentment, in the deluded belief that the
      hour would come. The principal items of news embraced the death of Squire
      Gregory Bulsted, the marriage of this and that young lady, a legal
      contention between my grandfather and Lady Maria Higginson, the wife of a
      rich manufacturer newly located among us, on account of a right of
      encampment on Durstan heath, my grandfather taking side with the gipsies,
      and beating her ladyship&mdash;a friend of Heriot&rsquo;s, by the way.
      Concerning Heriot, my aunt Dorothy was in trouble. She could not, she
      said, approve his behaviour in coming to this neighbourhood at all, and
      she hinted that I might induce him to keep away. I mentioned Julia
      Bulsted&rsquo;s being in mourning, merely to bring in her name tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, mourning&rsquo;s her outer rig, never doubt,&rsquo; said the squire. &lsquo;Flick your
      whip at her, she &lsquo;s a charitable soul, Judy Bulsted! She knits stockings
      for the poor. She&rsquo;d down and kiss the stump of a sailor on a stick o&rsquo; 
      timber. All the same, she oughtn&rsquo;t to be alone. Pity she hasn&rsquo;t a baby.
      You and I&rsquo;ll talk it over by-and-by, Harry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Kiomi was spoken of, and Lady Maria Higginson, and then Heriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;M-m-m-m rascal!&rsquo; hummed the squire. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s three, and that&rsquo;s not enough
      for him. Six months back a man comes over from Surreywards, a farm he
      calls Dipwell, and asks after you, Harry; rigmaroles about a handsome lass
      gone off... some scoundrel! You and I&rsquo;ll talk it over by-and-by, Harry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet raised and let fall her eyebrows. The fiction, that so much having
      been said, an immediate show of reserve on such topics preserved her in
      ignorance of them, was one she subscribed to merely to humour the squire.
      I was half in doubt whether I disliked or admired her want of decent
      hypocrisy. She allowed him to suppose that she did not hear, but spoke as
      a party to the conversation. My aunt Dorothy blamed Julia. The squire
      thundered at Heriot; Janet, liking both, contented herself with impartial
      comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I always think in these cases that the women must be the fools,&rsquo; she
      said. Her affectation was to assume a knowledge of the world and all
      things in it. We rode over to Julia&rsquo;s cottage, on the outskirts of the
      estate now devolved upon her husband. Irish eyes are certainly bewitching
      lights. I thought, for my part, I could not do as the captain was doing,
      serving his country in foreign parts, while such as these were shining
      without a captain at home. Janet approved his conduct, and was right.
      &lsquo;What can a wife think the man worth who sits down to guard his
      house-door?&rsquo; she answered my slight innuendo. She compared the man to a
      kennel-dog. &lsquo;This,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;comes of made-up matches,&rsquo; whereat she was
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia took her own view of her position. She asked me whether it was not
      dismal for one who was called a grass widow, and was in reality a
      salt-water one, to keep fresh, with a lapdog, a cook, and a maid-servant,
      and a postman that passed the gate twenty times for twice that he opened
      it, and nothing to look for but this disappointing creature day after day!
      At first she was shy, stole out a coy line of fingers to be shaken, and
      lisped; and out of that mood came right-about-face, with an exclamation of
      regret that she supposed she must not kiss me now. I projected, she drew
      back. &lsquo;Shall Janet go?&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;Then if nobody&rsquo;s present I &lsquo;ll be talked
      of,&rsquo; said she, moaning queerly. The tendency of her hair to creep loose of
      its bands gave her handsome face an aspect deliriously wild. I
      complimented her on her keeping so fresh, in spite of her salt-water
      widowhood. She turned the tables on me for looking so powerful, though I
      was dying for a foreign princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! but that&rsquo;ll blow over,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;anything blows over as long as you
      don&rsquo;t go up to the altar&rsquo;; and she eyed her ringed finger, woebegone, and
      flashed the pleasantest of smiles with the name of her William. Heriot,
      whom she always called Walter Heriot, was, she informed me, staying at
      Durstan Hall, the new great house, built on a plot of ground that the
      Lancashire millionaire had caught up, while the squire and the other
      landowners of the neighbourhood were sleeping. &lsquo;And if you get Walter
      Heriot to come to you, Harry Richmond, it&rsquo;ll be better for him, I&rsquo;m sure,&rsquo; 
      she added, and naively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I &lsquo;d like to meet him up at the Grange.&rsquo; Temple, she said, had left the
      Navy and was reading in London for the Bar&mdash;good news to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have not told us anything about your princess, Harry,&rsquo; Janet observed
      on the ride home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you take her for a real person, Janet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One thinks of her as a snow-mountain you&rsquo;ve been admiring.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well; so let her be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is she kind and good?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does she ride well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She rides remarkably well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She &lsquo;s fair, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Janet, if I saw you married to Temple, it would be the second great wish
      of my heart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harry, you&rsquo;re a bit too cruel, as Julia would say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you noticed she gets more and more Irish?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps she finds it is liked. Some women can adapt themselves... they
      &lsquo;re the happiest. All I meant to ask you is, whether your princess is like
      the rest of us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; said I, unconscious of hurting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind. Don&rsquo;t be hard on Julia. She has the making of a good woman&mdash;a
      girl can see that; only she can&rsquo;t bear loneliness, and doesn&rsquo;t understand
      yet what it is to be loved by a true gentleman. Persons of that class
      can&rsquo;t learn it all at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was pained to see her in tears. Her figure was straight, and she spoke
      without a quaver of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heriot&rsquo;s an excellent fellow,&rsquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is. I can&rsquo;t think ill of my friends,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear girl, is it these two who make you unhappy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; but dear old grandada!...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The course of her mind was obvious. I would rather have had her less
      abrupt and more personal in revealing it. I stammered something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heriot does not know you as I do,&rsquo; she said, strangling a whimper. &lsquo;I was
      sure it was serious, though one&rsquo;s accustomed to associate princesses with
      young men&rsquo;s dreams. I fear, Harry, it will half break our dear old
      grandada&rsquo;s heart. He is rough, and you have often been against him, for
      one unfortunate reason. If you knew him as I do you would pity him
      sincerely. He hardly grumbled at all at your terribly long absence. Poor
      old man! he hopes on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s incurably unjust to my father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your father has been with you all the time, Harry? I guessed it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It generally bodes no good to the Grange. Do pardon me for saying that. I
      know nothing of him; I know only that the squire is generous, and THAT I
      stand for with all my might. Forgive me for what I said.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Forgive you&mdash;with all my heart. I like you all the better. You &lsquo;re a
      brave partisan. I don&rsquo;t expect women to be philosophers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Harry, I would take your side as firmly as anybody&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do, then; tell the squire how I am situated.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; she half sighed, &lsquo;I knew this was coming.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How could it other than come? You can do what you like with the squire.
      I&rsquo;m dependent on him, and I am betrothed to the Princess Ottilia. God
      knows how much she has to trample down on her part. She casts off&mdash;to
      speak plainly, she puts herself out of the line of succession, and for
      whom? for me. In her father&rsquo;s lifetime she will hardly yield me her hand;
      but I must immediately be in a position to offer mine. She may: who can
      tell? she is above all women in power and firmness. You talk of
      generosity; could there be a higher example of it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I daresay; I know nothing of princesses,&rsquo; Janet murmured. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t quite
      comprehend what she has done. The point is, what am I to do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Prepare him for it. Soothe him in advance. Why, dear Janet, you can
      reconcile him to anything in a minute.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lie to him downright?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now what on earth is the meaning of that, and why can&rsquo;t you speak
      mildly?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose I speak as I feel. I&rsquo;m a plain speaker, a plain person. You
      don&rsquo;t give me an easy task, friend Harry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you believe in his generosity, Janet, should you be afraid to put it
      to proof?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grandada&rsquo;s generosity, Harry? I do believe in it as I believe in my own
      life. It happens to be the very thing I must keep myself from rousing in
      him, to be of any service to you. Look at the old house!&rsquo; She changed her
      tone. &lsquo;Looking on old Riversley with the eyes of my head even, I think I&rsquo;m
      looking at something far away in the memory. Perhaps the deep red brick
      causes it. There never was a house with so many beautiful creepers. Bright
      as they are, you notice the roses on the wall. There&rsquo;s a face for me
      forever from every window; and good-bye, Riversley! Harry, I&rsquo;ll obey your
      wishes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she headed me, trotting down the heath-track.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII. JANET RENOUNCES ME
    </h2>
    <p>
      An illness of old Sewis, the butler,&mdash;amazingly resembling a sick
      monkey in his bed,&mdash;kept me from paying a visit to Temple and seeing
      my father for several weeks, during which time Janet loyally accustomed
      the squire to hear of the German princess, and she did it with a decent
      and agreeable cheerfulness that I quite approved of. I should have been
      enraged at a martyr-like appearance on her part, for I demanded a
      sprightly devotion to my interests, considering love so holy a thing, that
      where it existed, all surrounding persons were bound to do it homage and
      service. We were thrown together a great deal in attending on poor old
      Sewis, who would lie on his pillows recounting for hours my father&rsquo;s
      midnight summons of the inhabitants of Riversley, and his little Harry&rsquo;s
      infant expedition into the world. Temple and Heriot came to stay at the
      Grange, and assisted in some rough scene-painting&mdash;torrid colours
      representing the island of Jamaica. We hung it at the foot of old Sewis&rsquo;s
      bed. He awoke and contemplated it, and went downstairs the same day,
      cured, he declared: the fact being that the unfortunate picture testified
      too strongly to the reversal of all he was used to in life, in having
      those he served to wait on him. The squire celebrated his recovery by
      giving a servants&rsquo; ball. Sewis danced with the handsomest lass, swung her
      to supper, and delivered an extraordinary speech, entirely concerning me,
      and rather to my discomposure, particularly so when it was my fate to hear
      that the old man had made me the heir of his savings. Such was his
      announcement, in a very excited voice, but incidentally upon a solemn
      adjuration to the squire to beware of his temper&mdash;govern his temper
      and not be a turncoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were present at the head of the supper-table to hear our healths drunk.
      Sewis spoke like a half-caste oblivious of his training, and of the
      subjects he was at liberty to touch on as well. Evidently there was a
      weight of foreboding on his mind. He knew his master well. The squire
      excused him under the ejaculation, &lsquo;Drunk, by the Lord!&rsquo; Sewis went so far
      as to mention my father &lsquo;He no disgrace, sar, he no disgrace, I say! but
      he pull one way, old house pull other way, and &lsquo;tween &lsquo;em my little Harry
      torn apieces, squire. He set out in the night &ldquo;You not enter it any more!&rdquo;
       Very well. I go my lawyer next day. You see my Will, squire. Years ago,
      and little Harry so high. Old Sewis not the man to change. He no turncoat,
      squire. God bless you, my master; you recollect, and ladies tell you if
      you forget, old Sewis no turncoat. You hate turncoat. You taught old
      Sewis, and God bless you, and Mr. Harry, and British Constitution, all
      Amen!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he bounded to bed. He was dead next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire was humorous over my legacy. It amounted to about seventeen
      hundred pounds invested in Government Stock, and he asked me what I meant
      to do with it; proposed a Charity to be established on behalf of decayed
      half-castes, insisting that servants&rsquo; money could never be appropriated to
      the uses of gentlemen. All the while he was muttering, &lsquo;Turncoat! eh?
      turncoat?&rsquo;&mdash;proof that the word had struck where it was aimed. For
      me, after thinking on it, I had a superstitious respect for the legacy, so
      I determined, in spite of the squire&rsquo;s laughter over &lsquo;Sixty pounds per
      annum!&rsquo; to let it rest in my name: I saw for the first time the
      possibility that I might not have my grandfather&rsquo;s wealth to depend upon.
      He warned me of growing miserly. With my father in London, living freely
      on my property, I had not much fear of that. However, I said discreetly,
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind spending when I see my way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! see your way,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Better a niggard than a chuckfist. Only,
      there &lsquo;s my girl: she &lsquo;s good at accounts. One &lsquo;ll do for them, Harry?&mdash;ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
      been long enough at home yet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Few were the occasions when our conversation did not diverge to this sort
      of interrogation. Temple and Heriot, with whom I took counsel, advised me
      to wait until the idea of the princess had worn its way into his
      understanding, and leave the work to Janet. &lsquo;Though,&rsquo; said Heriot to me
      aside, &lsquo;upon my soul, it&rsquo;s slaughter.&rsquo; He believed that Janet felt keenly.
      But then, she admired him, and so they repaid one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      I won my grandfather&rsquo;s confidence in practical matters on a trip we took
      into Wales. But it was not enough for me to be a man of business, he
      affirmed; he wanted me to have some ambition; why not stand for our county
      at the next general election? He offered me his Welsh borough if I thought
      fit to decline a contest. This was to speak as mightily as a German
      prince. Virtually, in wealth and power, he was a prince; but of how queer
      a kind! He was immensely gratified by my refraining to look out for my
      father on our return journey through London, and remarked, that I had not
      seen him for some time, he supposed. To which I said, no, I had not, He
      advised me to let the fellow run his length. Suggesting that he held it
      likely I contributed to &lsquo;the fellow&rsquo;s&rsquo; support: he said generously, &lsquo;Keep
      clear of him, Hal: I add you a thousand a year to your allowance,&rsquo; and
      damned me for being so thoughtful over it. I found myself shuddering at a
      breath of anger from him. Could he not with a word dash my hopes for ever?
      The warning I had taken from old Sewis transformed me to something like a
      hypocrite, and I dare say I gave the squire to understand, that I had not
      seen my father for a very long period and knew nothing of his recent
      doings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Been infernally quiet these last two or three years,&rsquo; the squire muttered
      of the object of his aversion. &lsquo;I heard of a City widow last, sick as a
      Dover packet-boat &lsquo;bout the fellow! Well, the women are ninnies, but
      you&rsquo;re a man, Harry; you&rsquo;re not to be taken in any longer, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I replied that I knew my father better now, and was asked how the deuce I
      knew him better; it was the world I knew better after my stay on the
      Continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      I contained myself enough to say, &lsquo;Very well, the world, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Flirted with one of their princesses?&rsquo; He winked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On that subject I will talk to you some other time,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Got to pay an indemnity? or what?&rsquo; He professed alarm, and pushed for
      explanations, with the air of a man of business ready to help me if need
      were. &lsquo;Make a clean breast of it, Harry. You &lsquo;re not the son of Tom Fool
      the Bastard for nothing, I&rsquo;ll swear. All the same you&rsquo;re Beltham; you&rsquo;re
      my grandson and heir, and I&rsquo;ll stand by you. Out with &lsquo;t! She&rsquo;s a
      princess, is she?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The necessity for correcting his impressions taught me to think the moment
      favourable. I said, &lsquo;I am engaged to her, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned promptly: &lsquo;Then you&rsquo;ll break it off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you can&rsquo;t jilt my girl at home!&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you find a princess objectionable, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Objectionable? She&rsquo;s a foreigner. I don&rsquo;t know her. I never saw her.
      Here&rsquo;s my Janet I&rsquo;ve brought up for you, under my own eyes, out of the way
      of every damned soft-sawderer, safe and plump as a melon under a glass,
      and you fight shy of her, and go and engage yourself to a foreigner I
      don&rsquo;t know and never saw! By George, Harry, I&rsquo;ll call in a parson to
      settle you soon as ever we sight Riversley. I&rsquo;ll couple you, by George, I
      will! &lsquo;fore either of you know whether you&rsquo;re on your legs or your backs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We were in the streets of London, so he was obliged to moderate his
      vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you consulted Janet?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Consulted her? ever since she was a chick with half a feather on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A chick with half a feather on,&rsquo; I remarked, &lsquo;is not always of the same
      mind as a piece of poultry of full plumage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hang your sneering and your talk of a fine girl, like my Janet, as a
      piece of poultry, you young rooster! You toss your head up like a cock too
      conceited to crow. I &lsquo;ll swear the girl &lsquo;s in love with you. She does you
      the honour to be fond of you. She &lsquo;s one in a million. A handsome girl,
      straight-backed, honest, just a dash, and not too much, of our blood in
      her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Consult her again, sir,&rsquo; I broke in. &lsquo;You will discover she is not of
      your way of thinking.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean to say she&rsquo;s given you a left-hander, Harry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have only to say that I have not given her the option.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He groaned going up the steps of his hotel, faced me once or twice, and
      almost gained my sympathy by observing, &lsquo;When we&rsquo;re boys, the old ones
      worry us; when we&rsquo;re old ones, the boys begin to tug!&rsquo; He rarely spoke so
      humanely,&mdash;rarely, at least, to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a wonder, he let the matter drop: possibly because he found me
      temperate. I tried the system on him with good effect during our stay in
      London; that is, I took upon myself to be always cool, always courteous,
      deliberate in my replies, and not uncordial, though I was for representing
      the reserved young man. I obtained some praise for my style and bearing
      among his acquaintances. To one lady passing an encomium on me, he said,
      &lsquo;Oh, some foreign princess has been training him,&rsquo; which seemed to me of
      good augury.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friends Temple and Heriot were among the Riversley guests at Christmas.
      We rode over to John Thresher&rsquo;s, of whom we heard that the pretty Mabel
      Sweetwinter had disappeared, and understood that suspicion had fallen upon
      one of us gentlemen. Bob, her brother, had gone the way of the bravest
      English fellows of his class-to America. We called on the miller, a soured
      old man. Bob&rsquo;s evasion affected him more than Mabel&rsquo;s, Martha Thresher
      said, in derision of our sex. I was pained to hear from her that Bob
      supposed me the misleader of his sister; and that he had, as she believed,
      left England, to avoid the misery of ever meeting me again, because he
      liked me so much. She had been seen walking down the lanes with some one
      resembling me in figure. Heriot took the miller&rsquo;s view, counting the loss
      of one stout young Englishman to his country of far greater importance
      than the escapades of dozens of girls, for which simple creatures he had
      no compassion: he held the expression of it a sham. He had grown
      coxcombical. Without talking of his conquests, he talked largely of the
      ladies who were possibly in the situation of victims to his grace of
      person, though he did not do so with any unctuous boasting. On the
      contrary, there was a rather taking undertone of regret that his enfeebled
      over-fat country would give her military son no worthier occupation. He
      laughed at the mention of Julia Bulsted&rsquo;s name. &lsquo;She proves, Richie,
      marriage is the best of all receipts for women, just as it&rsquo;s the worst for
      men. Poor Billy Bulsted, for instance, a first-rate seaman, and his
      heart&rsquo;s only half in his profession since he and Julia swore their oath;
      and no wonder,&mdash;he made something his own that won&rsquo;t go under lock
      and key. No military or naval man ought ever to marry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop,&rsquo; said Temple, &lsquo;is the poor old country&mdash;How about continuing
      the race of heroes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Heriot commended him to rectories, vicarages, and curates&rsquo; lodgings for
      breeding grounds, and coming round to Julia related one of the racy
      dialogues of her married life. &lsquo;The saltwater widow&rsquo;s delicious. Billy
      rushes home from his ship in a hurry. What&rsquo;s this Greg writes me?&mdash;That
      he &lsquo;s got a friend of his to drink with him, d&rsquo; ye mean, William?&mdash;A
      friend of yours, ma&rsquo;am.&mdash;And will you say a friend of mine is not a
      friend of yours, William?&mdash;Julia, you&rsquo;re driving me mad!&mdash;And is
      that far from crazy, where you said I drove you at first sight of me,
      William? Back to his ship goes Billy with a song of love and constancy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I said nothing of my chagrin at the behaviour of the pair who had
      furnished my first idea of the romantic beauty of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why does she talk twice as Irish as she used to, Heriot?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just to coax the world to let her be as nonsensical as she likes. She&rsquo;s
      awfully dull; she has only her nonsense to amuse her. I repeat: soldiers
      and sailors oughtn&rsquo;t to marry. I&rsquo;m her best friend. I am, on my honour:
      for I &lsquo;m going to make Billy give up the service, since he can&rsquo;t give her
      up. There she is!&rsquo; he cried out, and waved his hat to a lady on horseback
      some way down the slope of a road leading to the view of our heathland:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the only girl living fit to marry a man and swear she &lsquo;ll stick
      to him through life and death.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He started at a gallop. Temple would have gone too at any possible speed,
      for he knew as well as I did that Janet was the girl alone capable of
      winning a respectful word from Heriot; but I detained him to talk of
      Ottilia and my dismal prospect of persuading the squire to consent to my
      proposal for her, and to dower her in a manner worthy a princess. He doled
      out his yes and no to me vacantly. Janet and Heriot came at a walking pace
      to meet us, he questioning her, she replying, but a little differently
      from her usual habit of turning her full face to the speaker. He was
      evidently startled, and, to judge from his posture, repeated his question,
      as one would say, &lsquo;You did this?&rsquo; She nodded, and then uttered some rapid
      words, glanced at him, laughed shyly, and sank her features into repose as
      we drew near. She had a deep blush on her face. I thought it might be,
      that Janet and her loud champion had come to particular terms, a
      supposition that touched me with regrets for Temple&rsquo;s sake. But Heriot was
      not looking pleased. It happened that whatever Janet uttered struck a
      chord of opposition in me. She liked the Winter and the Winter sunsets,
      had hopes of a frost for skating, liked our climate, thought our way of
      keeping Christmas venerable, rejoiced in dispensing the squire&rsquo;s bounties&mdash;called
      them bounties, joined Heriot in abusing foreign countries to the
      exaltation of her own: all this with &lsquo;Well, Harry, I&rsquo;m sorry you don&rsquo;t
      think as we do. And we do, don&rsquo;t we?&rsquo; she addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I reserve a point,&rsquo; he said, and not playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      She appeared distressed, and courted a change of expression in his
      features, and I have to confess that never having seen her gaze upon any
      one save myself in that fashion, which was with her very winning,
      especially where some of her contralto tones of remonstrance or entreaty
      aided it, I felt as a man does at a neighbour&rsquo;s shadow cast over his
      rights of property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heriot dropped to the rear: I was glad to leave her with Temple, and glad
      to see them canter ahead together on the sand of tie heaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has done it,&rsquo; Heriot burst out abruptly. &lsquo;She has done it!&rsquo; he said
      again. &lsquo;Upon my soul, I never wished in my life before that I was a
      marrying man: I might have a chance of ending worth something. She has won
      the squire round with a thundering fib, and you&rsquo;re to have the German if
      you can get her. Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry. The squire &lsquo;ll speak to you
      to-night: but think over it. Will you? Think what a girl this is. I
      believe on my honour no man ever had such an offer of a true woman. Come,
      don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s Heriot speaking&mdash;I&rsquo;ve always liked her, of course.
      But I have always respected her, and that&rsquo;s not of course. Depend upon it,
      a woman who can be a friend of men is the right sort of woman to make a
      match with. Do you suppose she couldn&rsquo;t have a dozen fellows round her at
      the lift of her finger? the pick of the land! I&rsquo;d trust her with an army.
      I tell you, Janet Ilchester &lsquo;s the only girl alive who&rsquo;ll double the man
      she marries. I don&rsquo;t know another who wouldn&rsquo;t make the name of wife laugh
      the poor devil out of house and company. She&rsquo;s firm as a rock; and sweet
      as a flower on it! Will that touch you? Bah! Richie, let&rsquo;s talk like men.
      I feel for her because she&rsquo;s fond of you, and I know what it is when a
      girl like that sets her heart on a fellow. There,&rsquo; he concluded, &lsquo;I &lsquo;d ask
      you to go down on your knees and pray before you decide against her!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Heriot succeeded in raising a certain dull indistinct image in my mind of
      a well-meaning girl, to whom I was bound to feel thankful, and felt so. I
      thanked Heriot, too, for his friendly intentions. He had never seen the
      Princess Ottilia. And at night I thanked my grandfather. He bore himself,
      on the whole, like the good and kindly old gentleman Janet loved to
      consider him. He would not stand in my light, he said, recurring to that
      sheet-anchor of a tolerant sentence whenever his forehead began to gather
      clouds. He regretted that Janet was no better than her sex in her
      preference for rakes, and wished me to the deuce for bringing Heriot into
      the house, and not knowing when I was lucky. &lsquo;German grandchildren, eh!&rsquo; 
      he muttered. No Beltham had ever married a foreigner. What was the time
      fixed between us for the marriage? He wanted to see his line safe before
      he died. &lsquo;How do I know this foreign woman&rsquo;ll bear?&rsquo; he asked, expecting
      an answer. His hand was on the back of a chair, grasping and rocking it;
      his eyes bent stormily on the carpet; they were set blinking rapidly after
      a glance at me. Altogether his self-command was creditable to Janet&rsquo;s
      tuition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet met me next day, saying with some insolence (so it struck me from
      her liveliness): &lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all right, Harry? Now you&rsquo;ll be happy, I
      hope. I did not shine in my reply. Her amiable part appeared to be to let
      me see how brilliant and gracious the commonplace could be made to look.
      She kept Heriot at the Grange, against the squire&rsquo;s remonstrance and her
      mother&rsquo;s. &lsquo;It &lsquo;s to keep him out of harm&rsquo;s way: the women he knows are not
      of the best kind for him,&rsquo; she said, with astounding fatuity. He
      submitted, and seemed to like it. She must be teaching Temple to skate
      figures in the frost, with a great display of good-humoured patience, and
      her voice at musical pitches. But her principal affectation was to talk on
      matters of business with Mr. Burgin and Mr. Trewint, the squire&rsquo;s lawyer
      and bailiff, on mines and interest, on money and economical questions; not
      shrinking from politics either, until the squire cries out to the males
      assisting in the performance, &lsquo;Gad, she &lsquo;s a head as good as our
      half-dozen put together,&rsquo; and they servilely joined their fragmentary
      capitals in agreement. She went so far as to retain Peterborough to teach
      her Latin. He was idling in the expectation of a living in the squire&rsquo;s
      gift.
    </p>
    <p>
      The annoyance for me was that I could not detach myself from a
      contemplation of these various scenes, by reverting to my life in Germany.
      The preposterous closing of my interview with Ottilia blocked the way, and
      I was unable to write to her&mdash;unable to address her even in
      imagination, without pangs of shame at the review of the petty conspiracy
      I had sanctioned to entrap her to plight her hand to me, and without
      perpetually multiplying excuses for my conduct. So to escape them I was
      reduced to study Janet, forming one of her satellites. She could say to me
      impudently, with all the air of a friendly comrade, &lsquo;Had your letter from
      Germany yet, Harry?&rsquo; She flew&mdash;she was always on the chase. I saw her
      permit Heriot to kiss her hand, and then the squire appeared, and Heriot
      and she burst into laughter, and the squire, with a puzzled face, would
      have the game explained to him, but understood not a bit of it, only
      growled at me; upon which Janet became serious and chid him. I was told by
      my aunt Dorothy to admire this behaviour of hers. One day she certainly
      did me a service: a paragraph in one of the newspapers spoke of my father,
      not flatteringly: &lsquo;Richmond is in the field again,&rsquo; it commenced. The
      squire was waiting for her to hand the paper to him. None of us could
      comprehend why she played him off and denied him his right to the first
      perusal of the news; she was voluble, almost witty, full of sprightly
      Roxalana petulance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This paper,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;deserves to be burnt,&rsquo; and she was allowed to
      burn it&mdash;money article, mining column as well&mdash;on the pretext of
      an infamous anti-Tory leader, of which she herself composed the first
      sentence to shock the squire completely. I had sight of that paper some
      time afterwards. Richmond was in the field again, it stated, with mock
      flourishes. But that was not the worst. My grandfather&rsquo;s name was down
      there, and mine, and Princess Ottilia&rsquo;s. My father&rsquo;s connection with the
      court of Eppenwelzen-Sarkeld was alluded to as the latest, and next to his
      winning the heiress of Riversley, the most successful of his ventures,
      inasmuch as his son, if rumour was to be trusted, had obtained the promise
      of the hand of the princess. The paragraph was an excerpt from a gossiping
      weekly journal, perhaps less malevolent than I thought it. There was some
      fun to be got out of a man who, the journal in question was informed, had
      joined the arms of England and a petty German principality stamped on his
      plate and furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      My gratitude to Janet was fervent enough when I saw what she had saved me
      from. I pressed her hand and held it. I talked stupidly, but I made my
      cruel position intelligible to her, and she had the delicacy, on this
      occasion, to keep her sentiments regarding my father unuttered. We sat
      hardly less than an hour side by side&mdash;I know not how long hand in
      hand. The end was an extraordinary trembling in the limb abandoned to me.
      It seized her frame. I would have detained her, but it was plain she
      suffered both in her heart and her pride. Her voice was under fair
      command-more than mine was. She counselled me to go to London, at once. &lsquo;I
      would be off to London if I were you, Harry,&rsquo;&mdash;for the purpose of
      checking my father&rsquo;s extravagances,&mdash;would have been the further
      wording, which she spared me; and I thanked her, wishing, at the same
      time, that she would get the habit of using choicer phrases whenever there
      might, by chance, be a stress of emotion between us. Her trembling, and
      her &lsquo;I&rsquo;d be off,&rsquo; came into unpleasant collision in the recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      I acknowledge to myself that she was a true and hearty friend. She
      listened with interest to my discourse on the necessity of my being in
      Parliament before I could venture to propose formally for the hand of the
      princess, and undertook to bear the burden of all consequent negotiations
      with my grandfather. If she would but have allowed me to speak of Temple,
      instead of saying, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, Harry, I like him so much!&rsquo; at the very mention
      of his name, I should have sincerely felt my indebtedness to her, and some
      admiration of her fine spirit and figure besides. I could not even agree
      with my aunt Dorothy that Janet was handsome. When I had to grant her a
      pardon I appreciated her better.

      CHAPTER XXXVIII. MY BANKERS&rsquo; BOOK
    </h2>
    <p>
      The squire again did honour to Janet&rsquo;s eulogy and good management of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And where,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;would you find a Radical to behave so generously,
      Harry, when it touches him so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He accorded me his permission to select my side in politics, merely
      insisting that I was never to change it, and this he requested me to swear
      to, for (he called the ghost of old Sewis to witness) he abhorred a
      turncoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re to be a Whig, or a sneaking half-and-half, I can&rsquo;t help you
      much,&rsquo; he remarked. &lsquo;I can pop a young Tory in for my borough, maybe; but
      I can&rsquo;t insult a number of independent Englishmen by asking them to vote
      for the opposite crew; that&rsquo;s reasonable, eh? And I can&rsquo;t promise you
      plumpers for the county neither. You can date your Address from Riversley.
      You&rsquo;ll have your house in town. Tell me this princess of yours is ready
      with her hand, and,&rsquo; he threw in roughly, &lsquo;is a respectable young woman,
      I&rsquo;ll commence building. You&rsquo;ll have a house fit for a prince in town and
      country, both.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple had produced an effect on him by informing him that &lsquo;this princess
      of mine&rsquo; was entitled to be considered a fit and proper person, in rank
      and blood, for an alliance with the proudest royal Houses of Europe, and
      my grandfather was not quite destitute of consolation in the prospect I
      presented to him. He was a curious study to me, of the Tory mind, in its
      attachment to solidity, fixity, certainty, its unmatched generosity within
      a limit, its devotion to the family, and its family eye for the country.
      An immediate introduction to Ottilia would have won him to enjoy the idea
      of his grandson&rsquo;s marriage; but not having seen her, he could not realize
      her dignity, nor even the womanliness of a &lsquo;foreign woman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank God for one thing,&rsquo; he said: &lsquo;we shan&rsquo;t have that fellow bothering&mdash;shan&rsquo;t
      have the other half of your family messing the business. You&rsquo;ll have to
      account for him to your wife as you best can. I &lsquo;ve nothing to do with
      him, mind that. He came to my house, stole my daughter, crazed her wits,
      dragged us all...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The excuse to turn away from the hearing of abuse of my father was too
      good to be neglected, though it was horribly humiliating that I should
      have to take advantage of it&mdash;vexatious that I should seem chargeable
      with tacit lying in allowing the squire to suppose the man he hated to be
      a stranger to the princess. Not feeling sure whether it might be common
      prudence to delude him even passively, I thought of asking Janet for her
      opinion, but refrained. A stout deceiver has his merits, but a feeble
      hypocrite applying to friends to fortify him in his shifts and
      tergiversations must provoke contempt. I desired that Janet might continue
      to think well of me. I was beginning to drop in my own esteem, which was
      the mirror of my conception of Ottilia&rsquo;s view of her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, had I consulted Janet, I believe the course of my history would have
      been different, for she would not then, I may imagine, have been guilty of
      her fatal slip of the tongue that threw us into heavy seas when we thought
      ourselves floating on canal waters. A canal barge (an image to me of the
      most perfect attainable peace), suddenly, on its passage through our long
      fir-woods, with their scented reeds and flowing rushes, wild balsam and
      silky cotton-grass beds, sluiced out to sea and storm, would be somewhat
      in my likeness soon after a single luckless observation had passed at our
      Riversley breakfast-table one Sunday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt Dorothy and Mr. Peterborough were conversing upon the varieties of
      Christian sects, and particularly such as approached nearest to
      Anglicanism, together with the strange, saddening fact that the Christian
      religion appeared to be more divided than, Peterborough regretted to say,
      the forms of idolatry established by the Buddha, Mahomet, and other
      impostors. He claimed the audacious merit for us, that we did not discard
      the reason of man we admitted man&rsquo;s finite reason to our school of faith,
      and it was found refractory. Hence our many divisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Roman Catholics admit reason?&rsquo; said Janet, who had too strong a turn
      for showing her keenness in little encounters with Peterborough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;the Protestants.&rsquo; And, anxious to elude her, he pressed on
      to enchain my aunt Dorothy&rsquo;s attention. Janet plagued him meanwhile; and I
      helped her. We ran him and his schoolboy, the finite refractory, up and
      down, until Peterborough was glad to abandon him, and Janet said, &lsquo;Did you
      preach to the Germans much?&rsquo; He had officiated in Prince Ernest&rsquo;s private
      chapel: not, he added in his egregious modesty, not that he personally
      wished to officiate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was Harry&rsquo;s wish?&rsquo; Janet said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My post of tutor,&rsquo; Peterborough hastened to explain, &lsquo;was almost entirely
      supernumerary. The circumstances being so, I the more readily acquiesced
      in the title of private chaplain, prepared to fulfil such duties as
      devolved upon me in that capacity, and acting thereon I proffered my
      occasional services. Lutheranism and Anglicanism are not, doubtless you
      are aware, divided on the broader bases. We are common Protestants. The
      Papacy, I can assure you, finds as little favour with one as with the
      other. Yes, I held forth, as you would say, from time to time. My
      assumption of the title of private chaplain, it was thought, improved the
      family dignity&mdash;that is, on our side.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thought by Harry?&rsquo; said Janet; and my aunt Dorothy said, &lsquo;You and Harry
      had a consultation about it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wanted to appear as grand as they could,&rsquo; quoth the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peterborough signified an assent, designed to modify the implication. &lsquo;Not
      beyond due bounds, I trust, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! now I understand,&rsquo; Janet broke out in the falsetto notes of a puzzle
      solved in the mind. &lsquo;It was his father! Harry proclaiming his private
      chaplain!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Harry&rsquo;s father did first suggest&mdash;&rsquo; said Peterborough, but her
      quickly-altered features caused him to draw in his breath, as she had done
      after one short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather turned a round side-eye on me, hard as a cock&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet immediately started topics to fill Peterborough&rsquo;s mouth: the
      weather, the walk to church, the probable preacher. &lsquo;And, grandada,&rsquo; said
      she to the squire, who was muttering ominously with a grim under-jaw, &lsquo;His
      private chaplain!&rsquo; and for this once would not hear her, &lsquo;Grandada, I
      shall drive you over to see papa this afternoon.&rsquo; She talked as if nothing
      had gone wrong. Peterborough, criminal red, attacked a jam-pot for a
      diversion. &lsquo;Such sweets are rare indeed on the Continent,&rsquo; he observed to
      my aunt Dorothy. &lsquo;Our homemade dainties are matchless.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Private chaplain!&rsquo; the squire growled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s you that preach this afternoon,&rsquo; Janet said to Peterborough. &lsquo;Do you
      give us an extempore sermon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You remind me, Miss Ilchester, I must look to it; I have a little
      trimming to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Peterborough thought he might escape, but the squire arrested him. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll
      give me five minutes before you&rsquo;re out of the house, please. D&rsquo; ye smoke
      on Sundays?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not on Sundays, sir,&rsquo; said Peterborough, openly and cordially, as to
      signify that they were of one mind regarding the perniciousness of Sunday
      smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See you don&rsquo;t set fire to my ricks with your foreign chaplain&rsquo;s tricks. I
      spied you puffing behind one t&rsquo; other day. There,&rsquo; the squire dispersed
      Peterborough&rsquo;s unnecessary air of abstruse recollection, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t look as
      though you were trying to hit on a pin&rsquo;s head in a bushel of oats. Don&rsquo;t
      set my ricks on fire&mdash;that &lsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Peterborough,&rsquo; my aunt Dorothy interposed her voice to soften this
      rough treatment of him with the offer of some hot-house flowers for his
      sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I thank you!&rsquo; I heard the garlanded victim lowing as I left him to
      the squire&rsquo;s mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet followed me out. &lsquo;It was my fault, Harry. You won&rsquo;t blame him, I
      know. But will he fib? I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s capable of it, and I&rsquo;m sure he
      can&rsquo;t run and double. Grandada will have him fast before a minute is
      over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her to lose no time in going and extracting the squire&rsquo;s promise
      that Peterborough should have his living,&mdash;so much it seemed possible
      to save.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flew back, and in Peterborough&rsquo;s momentary absence, did her work.
      Nothing could save the unhappy gentleman from a distracting scene and much
      archaic English. The squire&rsquo;s power of vituperation was notorious: he
      could be more than a match for roadside navvies and predatory tramps in
      cogency of epithet. Peterborough came to me drenched, and wailing that he
      had never heard such language,&mdash;never dreamed of it. And to find
      himself the object of it!&mdash;and, worse, to be unable to
      conscientiously defend himself! The pain to him was in the conscience,&mdash;which
      is, like the spleen, a function whose uses are only to be understood in
      its derangement. He had eased his conscience to every question right out,
      and he rejoiced to me at the immense relief it gave him. Conscientiously,
      he could not deny that he knew the squire&rsquo;s objection to my being in my
      father&rsquo;s society; and he had connived at it &lsquo;for reasons, my dearest
      Harry, I can justify to God and man, but not&mdash;I had to confess as
      much&mdash;not, I grieve to say, to your grandfather. I attempted to do
      justice to the amiable qualities of the absent. In a moment I was assailed
      with epithets that... and not a word is to be got in when he is so
      violent. One has to make up one&rsquo;s mind to act Andromeda, and let him be
      the sea-monster, as somebody has said; I forget the exact origin of the
      remark.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire certainly had a whole ocean at command. I strung myself to pass
      through the same performance. To my astonishment I went unchallenged.
      Janet vehemently asserted that she had mollified the angry old man, who,
      however, was dark of visage, though his tongue kept silence. He was gruff
      over his wine-glass the blandishments of his favourite did not brighten
      him. From his point of view he had been treated vilely, and he was
      apparently inclined to nurse his rancour and keep my fortunes trembling in
      the balance. Under these circumstances it was impossible for me to
      despatch a letter to Ottilia, though I found that I could write one now,
      and I sat in my room writing all day,&mdash;most eloquent stuff it was.
      The shadow of misfortune restored the sense of my heroical situation,
      which my father had extinguished, and this unlocked the powers of speech.
      I wrote so admirably that my wretchedness could enjoy the fine millinery I
      decorated it in. Then to tear the noble composition to pieces was a bitter
      gratification. Ottilia&rsquo;s station repelled and attracted me mysteriously. I
      could not separate her from it, nor keep my love of her from the
      contentions into which it threw me. In vain I raved, &lsquo;What is rank?&rsquo; There
      was a magnet in it that could at least set me quivering and twisting,
      behaving like a man spellbound, as madly as any hero of the ballads under
      a wizard&rsquo;s charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the squire relieved us. He fixed that side-cast cock&rsquo;s eye of his
      on me, and said, &lsquo;Where &lsquo;s your bankers&rsquo; book, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I presumed that it was with my bankers, but did not suggest the
      possibility that my father might have it in his custody; for he had a
      cheque-book of his own, and regulated our accounts. Why not? I thought,
      and flushed somewhat defiantly. The money was mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any objection to my seeing that book?&rsquo; said the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None whatever, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. I made it a point of honour to write for the book to be sent
      down to me immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book arrived, and the squire handed it to me to break the cover,
      insisting, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re sure you wouldn&rsquo;t rather not have me look at it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite,&rsquo; I replied. The question of money was to me perfectly unimportant.
      I did not see a glimpse of danger in his perusing the list of my expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&lsquo;Cause I give you my word I know nothing about it now,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I complimented him on his frank method of dealing, and told him to look at
      the book if he pleased, but with prudence sufficiently awake to check the
      declaration that I had not once looked at it myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened it. We had just assembled in the hall, where breakfast was laid
      during Winter, before a huge wood fire. Janet had her teeth on her lower
      lip, watching the old man&rsquo;s face. I did not condescend to be curious; but
      when I turned my head to him he was puffing through thin lips, and then
      his mouth crumpled in a knob. He had seen sights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By George, I must have breakfast &lsquo;fore I go into this!&rsquo; he exclaimed, and
      stared as if he had come out of an oven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy Beltham reminded him that Prayers had not been read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Prayers!&rsquo; He was about to objurgate, but affirmatived her motion to ring
      the bell for the servants, and addressed Peterborough: &lsquo;You read &lsquo;em
      abroad every morning?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Peterborough&rsquo;s conscience started off on its inevitable jog-trot at a
      touch of the whip. &lsquo;A-yes; that is&mdash;oh, it was my office.&rsquo; He had to
      recollect with exactitude:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should specify exceptions; there were intervals...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please, open your Bible,&rsquo; the squire cut him short; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want a
      damned fine edge on everything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Partly for an admonition to him, or in pure nervousness, Peterborough blew
      his nose monstrously: an unlucky note; nothing went well after it. &lsquo;A
      slight cold,&rsquo; he murmured and resumed the note, and threw himself
      maniacally into it. The unexpected figure of Captain Bulsted on tiptoe,
      wearing the ceremonial depressed air of intruders on these occasions,
      distracted our attention for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fresh from ship, William?&rsquo; the squire called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain ejaculated a big word, to judge of it from the aperture, but
      it was mute as his footing on the carpet, and he sat and gazed devoutly
      toward Peterborough, who had waited to see him take his seat, and must
      now, in his hurry to perform his duty, sweep the peccant little redbound
      book to the floor. &lsquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll have that,&rsquo; said the squire. &lsquo;Allow me,
      sir,&rsquo; said Peterborough; and they sprang into a collision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you jump out of your pulpit to pick up an old woman&rsquo;s umbrella?&rsquo; 
      the squire asked him in wrath, and muttered of requiring none of his
      clerical legerdemain with books of business. Tears were in Peterborough&rsquo;s
      eyes. My aunt Dorothy&rsquo;s eyes dwelt kindly on him to encourage him, but the
      man&rsquo;s irritable nose was again his enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Bulsted chanced to say in the musical voice of inquiry: &lsquo;Prayers
      are not yet over, are they?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, nor never will be with a parson blowing his horn at this rate,&rsquo; the
      squire rejoined. &lsquo;And mind you,&rsquo; he said to Peterborough, after dismissing
      the servants, to whom my aunt Dorothy read the morning lessons apart, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d
      not have had this happen, sir, for money in lumps. I&rsquo;ve always known I
      should hang the day when my house wasn&rsquo;t blessed in the morning by prayer.
      So did my father, and his before him. Fiddle! sir, you can&rsquo;t expect young
      people to wear decent faces when the parson&rsquo;s hopping over the floor like
      a flea, and trumpeting as if the organ-pipe wouldn&rsquo;t have the sermon at
      any price. You tried to juggle me out of this book here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On my!&mdash;indeed, sir, no!&rsquo; Peterborough proclaimed his innocence, and
      it was unlikely that the squire should have suspected him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Bulsted had come to us for his wife, whom he had not found at home
      on his arrival last midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God bless my soul,&rsquo; said the squire, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t mean to tell me she&rsquo;s
      gone off, William?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! dear, no, sir,&rsquo; said the captain, &lsquo;she&rsquo;s only cruising.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire recommended a draught of old ale. The captain accepted it. His
      comportment was cheerful in a sober fashion, notwithstanding the
      transparent perturbation of his spirit. He answered my aunt Dorothy&rsquo;s
      questions relating to Julia simply and manfully, as became a gallant
      seaman, cordially excusing his wife for not having been at home to welcome
      him, with the singular plea, based on his knowledge of the sex, that the
      nearer she knew him to be the less able was she to sit on her chair
      waiting like Patience. He drank his ale from the hands of Sillabin, our
      impassive new butler, who had succeeded Sewis, the squire told him, like a
      Whig Ministry the Tory; proof that things were not improving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought, sir, things were getting better,&rsquo; said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The damnedest mistake ever made, William. How about the Fall of Man,
      then? eh? You talk like a heathen Radical. It&rsquo;s Scripture says we&rsquo;re going
      from better to worse, and that&rsquo;s Tory doctrine. And stick to the good as
      long as you can! Why, William, you were a jolly bachelor once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir, and ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; the captain bowed to Dorothy Beltham, &lsquo;I have, thanks to
      you, never known happiness but in marriage, and all I want is my wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire fretted for Janet to depart. &lsquo;I &lsquo;m going, grandada,&rsquo; she said.
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll oblige me by not attending to any matter of business to-day. Give
      me that book of Harry&rsquo;s to keep for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How d&rsquo; ye mean, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It &lsquo;s bad work done on a Sunday, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it is. I&rsquo;ll lock up the book.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have your word for that, grandada,&rsquo; said Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies retired, taking Peterborough with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye to the frocks! and now, William, out with your troubles,&rsquo; said
      the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain&rsquo;s eyes were turned to the door my aunt Dorothy had passed
      through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You remember the old custom, sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, do I, William. Sorry for you then; infernally sorry for you now, that
      I am! But you&rsquo;ve run your head into the halter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I love her, sir; I love her to distraction. Let any man on earth say
      she&rsquo;s not an angel, I flatten him dead as his lie. By the way, sir, I am
      bound in duty to inform you I am speaking of my wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure you are, William, and a trim schooner-yacht she is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She &lsquo;s off, sir; she&rsquo;s off!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought it time to throw in a word. &lsquo;Captain Bulsted, I should hold any
      man but you accountable to me for hinting such things of my friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harry, your hand,&rsquo; he cried, sparkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hum; his hand!&rsquo; growled the squire. &lsquo;His hand&rsquo;s been pretty lively on the
      Continent, William. Here, look at this book, William, and the bundle o&rsquo; 
      cheques! No, I promised my girl. We&rsquo;ll go into it to-morrow, he and I,
      early. The fellow has shot away thousands and thousands&mdash;been
      gallivanting among his foreign duchesses and countesses. There &lsquo;s a
      petticoat in that bank-book of his; and more than one, I wager. Now he&rsquo;s
      for marrying a foreign princess&mdash;got himself in a tangle there, it
      seems.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mightily well done, Harry!&rsquo; Captain Bulsted struck a terrific encomium on
      my shoulder, groaning, &lsquo;May she be true to you, my lad!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire asked him if he was going to church that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I go to my post, sir, by my fireside,&rsquo; the captain replied; nor could he
      be induced to leave his post vacant by the squire&rsquo;s promise to him of a
      sermon that would pickle his temper for a whole week&rsquo;s wear and tear. He
      regretted extremely that he could not enjoy so excellent a trial of his
      patience, but he felt himself bound to go to his post and wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked over to Bulsted with him, and heard on the way that it was Heriot
      who had called for her and driven her off. &lsquo;The man had been, I supposed,&rsquo; 
      Captain Bulsted said, &lsquo;deputed by some of you to fetch her over to
      Riversley. My servants mentioned his name. I thought it adviseable not to
      trouble the ladies with it to-day.&rsquo; He meditated. &lsquo;I hoped I should find
      her at the Grange in the morning, Harry. I slept on it, rather than
      startle the poor lamb in the night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I offered him to accompany him at once to Heriot&rsquo;s quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! and let my wife know I doubted her fidelity. My girl shall never
      accuse me of that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As it turned out, Julia had been taken by Heriot on a visit to Lady Maria
      Higginson, the wife of the intrusive millionaire, who particularly desired
      to know her more intimately. Thoughtless Julia, accepting the impudent
      invitation without scruple, had allowed herself to be driven away without
      stating the place of her destination. She and Heriot were in the
      Higginsons&rsquo; pew at church. Hearing from Janet of her husband&rsquo;s arrival,
      she rushed home, and there, instead of having to beg forgiveness, was
      summoned to grant pardon. Captain Bulsted had drawn largely on Squire
      Gregory&rsquo;s cellar to assist him in keeping his post.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pair appeared before us fondling ineffably next day, neither one of
      them capable of seeing that our domestic peace at the Grange was unseated.
      &lsquo;We &lsquo;re the two wretchedest creatures alive; haven&rsquo;t any of ye to spare a
      bit of sympathy for us?&rsquo; Julia began. &lsquo;We &lsquo;re like on a pitchfork. There&rsquo;s
      William&rsquo;s duty to his country, and there &lsquo;s his affection for me, and they
      won&rsquo;t go together, because Government, which is that horrid Admiralty,
      fears pitching and tossing for post-captains&rsquo; wives. And William away, I
      &lsquo;m distracted, and the Admiralty&rsquo;s hair&rsquo;s on end if he stops. And, &lsquo;deed,
      Miss Beltham, I&rsquo;m not more than married to just half a husband.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain echoed her, &lsquo;Half! but happy enough for twenty whole ones, if
      you&rsquo;ll be satisfied, my duck.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia piteously entreated me, for my future wife&rsquo;s sake, not to take
      service under Government. As for the Admiralty, she said, it had no
      characteristic but the abominable one, that it hated a woman. The squire
      laid two or three moderately coarse traps for the voluble frank creature,
      which she evaded with surprising neatness, showing herself more awake than
      one would have imagined her. Janet and I fancied she must have come with
      the intention to act uxorious husband and Irish wife for the distinct
      purpose of diverting the squire&rsquo;s wrath from me, for he greatly delighted
      in the sight of merry wedded pairs. But they were as simple as possible in
      their display of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced that they came opportunely. My bankers&rsquo; book had been the theme
      all the morning, and an astonishing one to me equally with my grandfather:
      Since our arrival in England, my father had drawn nine thousand pounds.
      The sums expended during our absence on the Continent reached the
      perplexing figures of forty-eight thousand. I knew it too likely, besides,
      that all debts were not paid. Self&mdash;self&mdash;self drew for
      thousands at a time; sometimes, as the squire&rsquo;s convulsive forefinger
      indicated, for many thousands within a week. It was incomprehensible to
      him until I, driven at bay by questions and insults, and perceiving that
      concealment could not long be practised, made a virtue of the situation by
      telling him (what he in fact must have seen) that my father possessed a
      cheque-book as well as I, and likewise drew upon the account. We had
      required the money; it was mine, and I had sold out Bank Stock and
      Consols,&mdash;which gave very poor interest, I remarked cursorily-and had
      kept the money at my bankers&rsquo;, to draw upon according to our necessities.
      I pitied the old man while speaking. His face was livid; language died
      from his lips. He asked to have little things explained to him&mdash;the
      two cheque-books, for instance,&mdash;and what I thought of doing when
      this money was all gone: for he supposed I did not expect the same amount
      to hand every two years; unless, he added, I had given him no more than a
      couple of years&rsquo; lease of life when I started for my tour. &lsquo;Then the
      money&rsquo;s gone!&rsquo; he summed up; and this was the signal for redemanding
      explanations. Had he not treated me fairly and frankly in handing over my
      own to me on the day of my majority? Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And like a fool, you think&mdash;eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no such thought in my head, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been keeping that fellow in his profligacy, and you &lsquo;re keeping
      him now. Why, you &lsquo;re all but a beggar!... Comes to my house, talks of his
      birth, carries off my daughter, makes her mad, lets her child grow up to
      lay hold of her money, and then grips him fast and pecks him, fleeces
      him!... You &lsquo;re beggared&mdash;d &lsquo;ye know that? He&rsquo;s had the two years of
      you, and sucked you dry. What were you about? What were you doing? Did you
      have your head on? You shared cheque-books? good!... The devil in hell
      never found such a fool as you! You had your house full of your foreign
      bonyrobers&mdash;eh? Out with it! How did you pass your time? Drunk and
      dancing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      By such degrees my grandfather worked himself up to the pitch for his
      style of eloquence. I have given a faint specimen of it. When I took the
      liberty to consider that I had heard enough, he followed me out of the
      library into the hall, where Janet stood. In her presence, he charged the
      princess and her family with being a pack of greedy adventurers,
      conspirators with &lsquo;that fellow&rsquo; to plunder me; and for a proof of it, he
      quoted my words, that my father&rsquo;s time had been spent in superintending
      the opening of a coal-mine on Prince Ernest&rsquo;s estate. &lsquo;That fellow
      pretending to manage a coal-mine!&rsquo; Could not a girl see it was a shuffle
      to hoodwink a greenhorn? And now he remembered it was Colonel Goodwin and
      his daughter who had told him of having seen &lsquo;the fellow&rsquo; engaged in
      playing Court-buffoon to a petty German prince, and performing his antics,
      cutting capers like a clown at a fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shame!&rsquo; said Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hear her!&rsquo; The squire turned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she cried: &lsquo;Oh! grandada, hear yourself! or don&rsquo;t, be silent. If Harry
      has offended you, speak like one gentleman to another. Don&rsquo;t rob me of my
      love for you: I haven&rsquo;t much besides that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, because of a scoundrel and his young idiot!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet frowned in earnest, and said: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t permit you to change the
      meaning of the words I speak.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He muttered a proverb of the stables. Reduced to behave temperately, he
      began the whole history of my bankers&rsquo; book anew&mdash;the same queries,
      the same explosions and imprecations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come for a walk with me, dear Harry,&rsquo; said Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      I declined to be protected in such a manner, absurdly on my dignity; and
      the refusal, together possibly with some air of contemptuous independence
      in the tone of it, brought the squire to a climax. &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t go out and
      walk with her? You shall go down on your knees to her and beg her to give
      you her arm for a walk. By God! you shall, now, here, on the spot, or off
      you go to your German princess, with your butler&rsquo;s legacy, and nothing
      more from me but good-bye and the door bolted. Now, down with you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He expected me to descend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if he did, he would never have my arm.&rsquo; Janet&rsquo;s eyes glittered hard
      on the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Before that rascal dies, my dear, he shall whine like a beggar out in the
      cold for the tips of your fingers!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not if he asks me first,&rsquo; said Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      This set him off again. He realized her prospective generosity, and
      contrasted it with my actual obtuseness. Janet changed her tactics. She
      assumed indifference. But she wanted experience, and a Heriot to help her
      in playing a part. She did it badly&mdash;overdid it; so that the old man,
      now imagining both of us to be against his scheme for uniting us, counted
      my iniquity as twofold. Her phrase, &lsquo;Harry and I will always be friends,&rsquo; 
      roused the loudest of his denunciations upon me, as though there never had
      been question of the princess, so inveterate was his mind&rsquo;s grasp of its
      original designs. Friends! Would our being friends give him heirs by law
      to his estate and name? And so forth. My aunt Dorothy came to moderate his
      invectives. In her room the heavily-burdened little book of figures was
      produced, and the items read aloud; and her task was to hear them without
      astonishment, but with a business-like desire to comprehend them
      accurately, a method that softened the squire&rsquo;s outbursts by degrees. She
      threw out hasty running commentaries: &lsquo;Yes, that was for a yacht&rsquo;; and
      &lsquo;They were living at the Court of a prince&rsquo;; such and such a sum was
      &lsquo;large, but Harry knew his grandfather did not wish him to make a poor
      appearance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, do you mean to swear to me, on your oath, Dorothy Beltham,&rsquo; said the
      squire, amazed at the small amazement he created &lsquo;you think these two
      fellows have been spending within the right margin? What&rsquo;ll be women&rsquo;s
      ideas next!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she answered demurely. &lsquo;I think Harry has been extravagant, and has
      had his lesson. And surely it is better now than later? But you are, not
      making allowances for his situation as the betrothed of a princess.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That &lsquo;s what turns your head,&rsquo; said he; and she allowed him to have the
      notion, and sneer at herself and her sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How about this money drawn since he came home?&rsquo; the squire persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt Dorothy reddened. He struck his finger on the line marking the
      sum, repeating his demand; and at this moment Captain Bulsted and Julia
      arrived. The ladies manoeuvred so that the captain and the squire were
      left alone together. Some time afterward the captain sent out word that he
      begged his wife&rsquo;s permission to stay to dinner at the Grange, and
      requested me to favour him by conducting his wife to Bulsted: proof, as
      Julia said, that the two were engaged in a pretty hot tussle. She was sure
      her William would not be the one to be beaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      I led her away, rather depressed by the automaton performance assigned to
      me; from which condition I awoke with a touch of horror to find myself
      paying her very warm compliments; for she had been coquettish and charming
      to cheer me, and her voice was sweet. We reached a point in our
      conversation I know not where, but I must have spoken with some warmth.
      &lsquo;Then guess,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;what William is suffering for your sake now,
      Harry&rsquo;; that is, &lsquo;suffering in remaining away from me on your account&rsquo;;
      and thus, in an instant, with a skill so intuitive as to be almost
      unconscious, she twirled me round to a right sense of my position, and set
      me reflecting, whether a love that clad me in such imperfect armour as to
      leave me penetrable to these feminine graces&mdash;a plump figure,
      swinging skirts, dewy dark eyelids, laughing red lips&mdash;could indeed
      be absolute love. And if it was not love of the immortal kind, what was I?
      I looked back on the thought like the ship on its furrow through the
      waters, and saw every mortal perplexity, and death under. My love of
      Ottilia delusion? Then life was delusion! I contemplated Julia in alarm,
      somewhat in the light fair witches were looked on when the faggots were
      piled for them. The sense of her unholy attractions abased and mortified
      me: and it set me thinking on the strangeness of my disregard of Mdlle.
      Jenny Chassediane when in Germany, who was far sprightlier, if not
      prettier, and, as I remembered, had done me the favour to make discreet
      play with her eyelids in our encounters, and long eyes in passing. I
      caught myself regretting my coldness of that period; for which regrets I
      could have swung the scourge upon my miserable flesh. Ottilia&rsquo;s features
      seemed dying out of my mind. &lsquo;Poor darling Harry!&rsquo; Julia sighed. &lsquo;And d&rsquo; 
      ye know, the sight of a young man far gone in love gives me the trembles?&rsquo; 
      I rallied her concerning the ladder scene in my old schooldays, and the
      tender things she had uttered to Heriot. She answered, &lsquo;Oh, I think I got
      them out of poets and chapters about lovemaking, or I felt it very much.
      And that&rsquo;s what I miss in William; he can&rsquo;t talk soft nice nonsense. I
      believe him, he would if he could, but he &lsquo;s like a lion of the desert&mdash;it
      &lsquo;s a roar!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I rejoiced when we heard the roar. Captain Bulsted returned to take
      command of his ship, not sooner than I wanted him, and told us of a fierce
      tussle with the squire. He had stuck to him all day, and up to 11 P.M. &lsquo;By
      George! Harry, he had to make humble excuses to dodge out of eyeshot a
      minute. Conquered him over the fourth bottle! And now all&rsquo;s right. He&rsquo;ll
      see your dad. &ldquo;In a barn?&rdquo; says the squire. &ldquo;Here &lsquo;s to your better
      health, sir,&rdquo; I bowed to him; &ldquo;gentlemen don&rsquo;t meet in barns; none but
      mice and traps make appointments there.&rdquo; To shorten my story, my lad, I
      have arranged for the squire and your excellent progenitor to meet at
      Bulsted: we may end by bringing them over a bottle of old Greg&rsquo;s best.
      &ldquo;See the boy&rsquo;s father,&rdquo; I kept on insisting. The point is, that this
      confounded book must be off your shoulders, my lad. A dirty dog may wash
      in a duck-pond. You see, Harry, the dear old squire may set up your
      account twenty times over, but he has a right to know how you twirl the
      coin. He says you don&rsquo;t supply the information. I suggest to him that your
      father can, and will. So we get them into a room together. I&rsquo;ll be
      answerable for the rest. And now top your boom, and to bed here: off in
      the morning and tug the big vessel into port here! And, Harry, three
      cheers, and another bottle to crown the victory, if you &lsquo;re the man for
      it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia interposed a decided negative to the proposal; an ordinarily unlucky
      thing to do with bibulous husbands, and the captain looked uncomfortably
      checked; but when he seemed to be collecting to assert himself, the humour
      of her remark, &lsquo;Now, no bravado, William,&rsquo; disarmed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bravado, my sweet chuck?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t another bottle be like flashing your sword after you&rsquo;ve won the
      day?&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slung his arm round her, and sent a tremendous whisper into my ear&mdash;&lsquo;A
      perfect angel!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I started for London next day, more troubled aesthetically regarding the
      effect produced on me by this order of perfect angels than practically
      anxious about material affairs, though it is true that when I came into
      proximity with my father, the thought of his all but purely mechanical
      power of making money spin, fly, and vanish, like sparks from a
      fire-engine, awakened a serious disposition in me to bring our monetary
      partnership to some definite settlement. He was living in splendour, next
      door but one to the grand establishment he had driven me to from Dipwell
      in the old days, with Mrs. Waddy for his housekeeper once more, Alphonse
      for his cook. Not living on the same scale, however, the troubled woman
      said. She signified that it was now the whirlwind. I could not help
      smiling to see how proud she was of him, nevertheless, as a god-like
      charioteer&mdash;in pace, at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Opera to-night,&rsquo; she answered my inquiries for him, admonishing me by her
      tone that I ought not to be behindhand in knowing his regal rules and
      habits. Praising his generosity, she informed me that he had spent one
      hundred pounds, and offered a reward of five times the sum, for the
      discovery of Mabel Sweetwinter. &lsquo;Your papa never does things by halves,
      Mr. Harry!&rsquo; Soon after she was whimpering, &lsquo;Oh, will it last?&rsquo; I was shown
      into the room called &lsquo;The princess&rsquo;s room,&rsquo; a miracle of furniture, not
      likely to be occupied by her, I thought, the very magnificence of the
      apartment striking down hope in my heart like cold on a nerve. Your papa
      says the whole house is to be for you, Mr. Harry, when the happy day
      comes.&rsquo; Could it possibly be that he had talked of the princess? I took a
      hasty meal and fortified myself with claret to have matters clear with him
      before the night was over.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX. I SEE MY FATHER TAKING THE TIDE AND AM CARRIED ON IT MYSELF
    </h2>
    <p>
      My father stood in the lobby of the Opera, holding a sort of open court,
      it appeared to me, for a cluster of gentlemen hung round him; and I had
      presently to bow to greetings which were rather of a kind to flatter me,
      leading me to presume that he was respected as well as marvelled at. The
      names of Mr. Serjeant Wedderburn, Mr. Jennings, Lord Alton, Sir Weeton
      Slater, Mr. Monterez Williams, Admiral Loftus, the Earl of Witlington,
      were among those which struck my ear, and struck me as good ones. I could
      not perceive anything of the air of cynical satellites in these gentlemen&mdash;on
      the contrary, they were cordially deferential. I felt that he was
      encompassed by undoubted gentlemen, and my warmer feelings to my father
      returned when I became sensible of the pleasant sway he held over the
      circle, both in speaking and listening. His sympathetic smile and
      semi-droop of attention; his readiness, when occasion demanded it, to hit
      the key of the subject and help it on with the right word; his air of
      unobtrusive appreciation; his sensibility to the moment when the run of
      conversation depended upon him&mdash;showed inimitable art coming of
      natural genius; and he did not lose a shade of his superior manner the
      while. Mr. Serjeant Wedderburn, professionally voluble, a lively talker,
      brimming with anecdote, but too sparkling, too prompt, too full of
      personal relish of his point, threw my father&rsquo;s urbane supremacy into
      marked relief; and so in another fashion did the Earl of Witlington, &lsquo;a
      youth in the season of guffaws,&rsquo; as Jorian DeWitt described him, whom a
      jest would seize by the throat, shaking his sapling frame. Jorian strolled
      up to us goutily. No efforts of my father&rsquo;s would induce him to illustrate
      his fame for repartee, so it remained established. &lsquo;Very pretty waxwork,&rsquo; 
      he said to me of our English beauties swimming by. &lsquo;Now, those women,
      young Richmond, if they were inflammable to the fiftieth degree, that is,
      if they had the fiftieth part of a Frenchwoman in them, would have
      canvassed society on the great man&rsquo;s account long before this, and sent
      him to the top like a bubble. He wastes his time on them. That fat woman
      he&rsquo;s bowing to is Viscountess Sedley, a porcine empress, widow of three,
      with a soupcon of bigamy to flavour them. She mounted from a grocer&rsquo;s
      shop, I am told. Constitution has done everything for that woman. So it
      will everywhere&mdash;it beats the world! Now he&rsquo;s on all-fours to Lady
      Rachel Stokes, our pure aristocracy; she walks as if she were going
      through a doorway, and couldn&rsquo;t risk an eyelid. I &lsquo;d like to see her
      tempting St. Anthony. That&rsquo;s little Wreckham&rsquo;s wife: she&rsquo;s had as many
      adventures as Gil Blas before he entered the Duke of Lerma&rsquo;s service.&rsquo; He
      reviewed several ladies, certainly not very witty when malignant, as I
      remembered my father to have said of him. &lsquo;The style of your Englishwoman
      is to keep the nose exactly at one elevation, to show you&rsquo;re born to it.
      They daren&rsquo;t run a gamut, these women. These Englishwomen are a fiction!
      The model of them is the nursery-miss, but they&rsquo;re like the names of true
      lovers cut on the bark of a tree&mdash;awfully stiff and longitudinal with
      the advance of time. We&rsquo;ve our Lady Jezebels, my boy! They&rsquo;re in the pay
      of the bishops, or the police, to make vice hideous. The rest do the same
      for virtue, and get their pay for it somewhere, I don&rsquo;t doubt; perhaps
      from the newspapers, to keep up the fiction. I tell you, these
      Englishwomen have either no life at all in them, or they&rsquo;re nothing but
      animal life. &lsquo;Gad, how they dizen themselves! They&rsquo;ve no other use for
      their fingers. The wealth of this country&rsquo;s frightful!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jorian seemed annoyed that he could not excite me to defend my
      countrywomen; but I had begun to see that there was no necessity for the
      sanguine to encounter the bilious on their behalf, and was myself inclined
      to be critical. Besides I was engaged in watching my father, whose bearing
      toward the ladies he accosted did not dissatisfy my critical taste, though
      I had repeated fears of seeing him overdo it. He summoned me to an
      introduction to the Countess Szezedy, a merry little Hungarian dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So,&rsquo; said she at once, speaking German, &lsquo;you are to marry the romantic
      head, the Princess Ottilia of Eppenwelzen! I know her well. I have met her
      in Vienna. Schone Seele, and bas bleu! It&rsquo;s just those that are won with a
      duel. I know Prince Otto too.&rsquo; She prattled away, and asked me whether the
      marriage was to take place in the Summer. I was too astounded to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No date is yet fixed,&rsquo; my father struck in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the talk of London,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I could demand explanations of my father with regard to this
      terrible rumour involving Ottilia, I found myself in the box of the City
      widow, Lady Sampleman, a grievous person, of the complexion of the
      autumnal bramble-leaf, whose first words were: &lsquo;Ah! the young suitor! And
      how is our German princess?&rsquo; I had to reply that the theme was more of
      German princes than princesses in England. &lsquo;Oh! but,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;you are
      having a&mdash;shall I call it&mdash;national revenge on them? &ldquo;I will
      take one of your princesses,&rdquo; says you; and as soon as said done! I&rsquo;m
      dying for a sight of her portrait. Captain DeWitt declares her heavenly&mdash;I
      mean, he says she is fair and nice, quite a lady-that of course! And never
      mind her not being rich. You can do the decoration to the match. H&rsquo;m,&rsquo; she
      perused my features; &lsquo;pale! Lovelorn? Excuse an old friend of your
      father&rsquo;s. One of his very oldest, I&rsquo;d say, if it didn&rsquo;t impugn. As such,
      proud of your alliance. I am. I speak of it everywhere&mdash;everywhere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she dramatized the circulation of the gossip. &lsquo;Have you heard the
      news? No, what? Fitz-George&rsquo;s son marries a princess of the German realm.
      Indeed! True as gospel. And how soon? In a month; and now you will see the
      dear, neglected man command the Court....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at my father: I felt stifling with confusion and rage. He leant
      over to her, imparting some ecstatic news about a great lady having
      determined to call on her to regulate the affairs of an approaching grand
      Ball, and under cover of this we escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it were not,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;for the Chassediane&mdash;you are aware,
      Richie, poor Jorian is lost to her?&mdash;he has fallen at her quicksilver
      feet. She is now in London. Half the poor fellow&rsquo;s income expended in
      bouquets! Her portrait, in the character of the widow Lefourbe, has become
      a part of his dressing apparatus; he shaves fronting her playbill. His
      first real affaire de coeur, and he is forty-five! So he is taken in the
      stomach. That is why love is such a dangerous malady for middle age. As I
      said, but for Jenny Chassediane, our Sampleman would be the fortune for
      Jorian. I have hinted it on both sides. Women, Richie, are cleverer than
      the illustrious Lord Nelson in not seeing what their inclinations decline
      to see, and Jorian would do me any service in the world except that one.
      You are restless, my son?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I begged permission to quit the house, and wait for him outside. He, in
      return, begged me most urgently to allow myself to be introduced to Lady
      Edbury, the stepmother of Lord Destrier, now Marquis of Edbury; and, using
      conversational pressure, he adjured me not to slight this lady, adding,
      with more significance than the words conveyed, &lsquo;I am taking the tide,
      Richie.&rsquo; The tide took me, and I bowed to a lady of impressive languor,
      pale and young, with pleasant manners, showing her character in outline,
      like a glove on the hand, but little of its quality. She accused my father
      of coming direct from &lsquo;that person&rsquo;s&rsquo; box. He replied that he never
      forsook old friends. &lsquo;You should,&rsquo; was her rejoinder. It suggested to me
      an image of one of the sister Fates cutting a thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart sank when, from Lady Edbury too, I heard the allusion to Germany
      and its princess. &lsquo;Some one told me she was dark?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Blonde,&rsquo; my father corrected the report.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Edbury &lsquo;thought it singular for a German woman of the Blood to be a
      brunette. They had not much dark mixture among them, particularly in the
      North. Her name? She had forgotten the name of the princess.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father repeated: &lsquo;The Princess Ottilia, Princess of
      Eppenwelzen-Sarkeld.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brunette, you say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The purest blonde.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A complexion?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A complexion to dazzle the righteous!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Edbury threw a flying glance in a mirror: &lsquo;The unrighteous you leave
      to us then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They bandied the weariful shuttlecock of gallantry. I bowed and fled. My
      excuse was that I had seen Anna Penrhys in an upper tier of boxes, and I
      made my way to her, doubting how I should be welcomed. &lsquo;The happy woman is
      a German princess, we hear!&rsquo; she set me shivering. Her welcome was
      perfectly unreserved and friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked the name of the lady whose box I had quitted, and after bending
      her opera-glass on it for a moment, said, with a certain air of
      satisfaction, &lsquo;She is young&rsquo;; which led me to guess that Lady Edbury was
      reputed to be Anna&rsquo;s successor; but why the latter should be flattered by
      the former&rsquo;s youth was one of the mysteries for me then. Her aunt was
      awakened from sleep by the mention of my name. &lsquo;Is the man here?&rsquo; she
      exclaimed, starting. Anna smiled, and talked to me of my father, saying,
      that she was glad to see me at his right hand, for he had a hard battle to
      fight. She spoke of him with affectionate interest in his fortunes; no
      better proof of his generosity as well as hers could have been given me. I
      promised her heartily I would not be guilty of letting our intimacy drop,
      and handed the ladies down to the crush-room, where I saw my father
      leading Lady Edbury to her carriage, much observed. Destrier, the young
      marquis, coming in to meet the procession from other haunts, linked his
      arm to his friend Witlington&rsquo;s, and said something in my hearing of old
      &lsquo;Duke Fitz,&rsquo; which provoked, I fancied, signs of amusement equivalent to
      tittering in a small ring of the select assembly. Lady Sampleman&rsquo;s
      carriage was called. &lsquo;Another victim,&rsquo; said a voice. Anna Penrhys walked
      straight out to find her footman and carriage for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood alone in the street, wondering, fretting, filled with a variety of
      ugly sensations, when my father joined me humming an air of the opera. &lsquo;I
      was looking for Jorian, Richie. He had our Sampleman under his charge. He
      is off to the Chassediane. Well! And well, Richie, you could not bear the
      absence from your dada? You find me in full sail on the tide. I am at
      home, if our fortunes demand it, in a little German principality, but
      there is,&rsquo; he threw out his chest, &lsquo;a breadth in London; nowhere else do I
      breathe with absolute freedom&mdash;so largely: and this is my
      battlefield. By the way, Lady Edbury accounts you complete; which is no
      more to say than that she is a woman of taste. The instance: she
      positively would not notice that you wear a dress-coat of a foreign cut.
      Correct it to-morrow; my tailor shall wait on you. I meant to point out to
      you that when a London woman has not taken note of that, the face and the
      man have made the right impression on her. Richie, dear boy, how shall I
      speak the delight I have in seeing you! My arm in yours, old Richie!
      strolling home from the Fashion: this seems to me what I dreamt of! All in
      sound health at the Grange? She too, the best of women?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have come on very particular business,&rsquo; I interposed briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied, &lsquo;I am alive to you, Richie; speak.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The squire has seen my bankers&rsquo; book. He thinks I&rsquo;ve been drawing rather
      wildly: no doubt he&rsquo;s right. He wants some sort of explanation. He
      consents to an interview with you. I have come to ask you to go down to
      him, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow morning, without an hour&rsquo;s delay, my dear boy. Very agreeable
      will be the sight of old Riversley. And in the daylight!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He prefers to meet you at Bulsted. Captain Bulsted offers his house for
      the purpose. I have to warn you, sir, that we stand in a very exceptional
      position. The squire insists upon having a full account of the money
      rendered to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I invite him to London, Richie. I refer him to Dettermain and Newson. I
      request him to compute the value of a princess.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are aware that he will not come to your invitation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me, then, how is he to understand what I have established by the
      expenditure, my son? I refer him to Dettermain and Newson.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you must know that he sets his face against legal proceedings
      involving exposure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But surely, Richie, exposure is the very thing we court. The innocent,
      the unjustly treated, court it. We would be talked about; you shall hear
      of us! And into the bargain an hereditary princess. Upon my faith, Mr.
      Beltham, I think you have mighty little to complain of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My temper was beginning to chafe at the curb. &lsquo;As regards any feeling
      about the money, personally, sir, you know I have none. But I must speak
      of one thing. I have heard to-night, I confess with as much astonishment
      as grief, the name... I could not have guessed that I should hear the
      princess&rsquo;s name associated with mine, and quite openly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As a matter of course.&rsquo; He nodded, and struck out a hand in wavy motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir, if you can&rsquo;t feel for her or her family, be good enough to
      think of me, and remember that I object to it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For you all,&rsquo; said he, buoyantly; &lsquo;I feel for you all, and I will act for
      you all. I bring the princess to your arms, my dear boy. You have written
      me word that the squire gives her a royal dowry&mdash;have you not? My
      combinations permit of no escape to any one of you. Nay, &lsquo;tis done. I
      think for you&mdash;I feel for you&mdash;I act for you. By heaven, you
      shall be happy! Sigh, Richie, sigh; your destiny is now entrusted to me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I daresay I&rsquo;m wasting my breath, sir, but I protest against false
      pretences. You know well that you have made use of the princess&rsquo;s name for
      your own purposes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most indubitably, Richie, I have; and are they not yours? I must have
      social authority to succeed in our main enterprise. Possibly the
      princess&rsquo;s name serves for a temporary chandelier to cast light on us. She
      belongs to us. For her sake, we are bringing the house she enters into
      order. Thus, Richie, I could tell Mr. Beltham: you and he supply the
      money, the princess the name, and I the energy, the skilfulness, and the
      estimable cause. I pay the princess for the use of her name with the
      dowry, which is royal; I pay you with the princess, who is royal too; and
      I, Richie, am paid by your happiness most royally. Together, it is past
      contest that we win.&mdash;Here, my little one,&rsquo; he said to a woman, and
      dropped a piece of gold into her hand, &lsquo;on condition that you go straight
      home.&rsquo; The woman thanked him and promised. &lsquo;As I was observing, we are in
      the very tide of success. Curious! I have a slight inclination to
      melancholy. Success, quotha? Why, hundreds before us have paced the
      identical way homeward at night under these lamps between the mansions and
      the park. The bare thought makes them resemble a double line of
      undertakers. The tomb is down there at the end of them&mdash;costly or
      not. At the age of four, on my birthday, I was informed that my mother lay
      dead in her bed. I remember to this day my astonishment at her not moving.
      &ldquo;Her heart is broken,&rdquo; my old nurse said. To me she appeared intact. Her
      sister took possession of me, and of her papers, and the wedding-ring&mdash;now
      in the custody of Dettermain and Newson&mdash;together with the portraits
      of both my parents; and she, poor soul, to sustain me, as I verily believe&mdash;she
      had a great idea of my never asking unprofitably for anything in life&mdash;bartered
      the most corroborative of the testificatory documents, which would now
      make the establishment of my case a comparatively light task. Have I never
      spoken to you of my boyhood? My maternal uncle was a singing-master and
      master of elocution. I am indebted to him for the cultivation of my voice.
      He taught me an effective delivery of my sentences. The English of a book
      of his called The Speaker is still to my mind a model of elegance.
      Remittances of money came to him from an unknown quarter; and, with a
      break or two, have come ever since up to this period. My old nurse-heaven
      bless her&mdash;resumed the occupation of washing. I have stood by her
      tub, Richie, blowing bubbles and listening to her prophecies of my exalted
      fortune for hours. On my honour, I doubt, I seriously doubt, if I have
      ever been happier. I depend just now&mdash;I have to avow it to you&mdash;slightly
      upon stimulants... of a perfectly innocuous character. Mrs. Waddy will
      allow me a pint of champagne. The truth is, Richie&mdash;you see these two
      or three poor pensioners of mine, honi soit qui mal y pense&mdash;my
      mother has had hard names thrown at her. The stones of these streets cry
      out to me to have her vindicated. I am not tired; but I want my wine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He repeated several times before he reached his housedoor, that he wanted
      his wine, in a manner to be almost alarming. His unwonted effort of
      memory, the singular pictures of him which it had flashed before me, and a
      sort of impatient compassion, made me forget my wrath. I saw him take his
      restorative at one draught. He lay down on a sofa, and his valet drew his
      boots off and threw a cloak over him. Lying there, he wished me gaily
      good-night. Mrs. Waddy told me that he had adopted this system of sleeping
      for the last month. &lsquo;Bless you, as many people call on him at night now as
      in the day,&rsquo; she said; and I was induced to suppose he had some connection
      with the Press. She had implicit faith in his powers of constitution, and
      would affirm, that he had been the death of dozens whom the attraction had
      duped to imitate his habits. &lsquo;He is now a Field-Marshal on his campaign.&rsquo; 
      She betrayed a twinkle of humour. He must himself have favoured her with
      that remark. The report of the house-door frequently shutting in the night
      suggested the passage of his aides-de-camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the morning, I found him pacing through the open doors of the
      dining-room and the library dictating to a secretary at a desk, now and
      then tossing a word to Dettermain and Newson&rsquo;s chief clerk. The floor was
      strewn with journals. He wore Hessian boots; a voluminous black cloak hung
      loosely from his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am just settling the evening papers,&rsquo; he said after greeting me, with a
      show of formality in his warmth; and immediately added, &lsquo;That will do, Mr.
      Jopson. Put in a note&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Harry Lepel Richmond of Riversley and
      Twn-y-glas, my son, takes no step to official distinction in his native
      land save through the ordinary Parliamentary channels.&rdquo; Your pardon,
      Richie; presently. I am replying to a morning paper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s this? Why print my name?&rsquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Merely the correction of an error. I have to insist, my dear boy, that
      you claim no privileges: you are apart from them. Mr. Jopson, I beseech
      you, not a minute&rsquo;s delay in delivering that. Fetch me from the printer&rsquo;s
      my pamphlet this afternoon. Mr. Jacobs, my compliments to Dettermain and
      Newson: I request them to open proceedings instanter, and let the world
      know of it. Good-morning, gentlemen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, turning to me, my father fenced me with the whole weight of his
      sententious volubility, which was the force of a river. Why did my name
      appear in the papers? Because I was his son. But he assured me that he
      carefully separated me from public companionship with his fortunes, and
      placed me on the side of my grandfather, as a plain gentleman of England,
      the heir of the most colossal wealth possible in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dis-sociate you from me, Richie, do you see? I cause it to be declared
      that you need, on no account, lean on me. Jopson will bring you my
      pamphlet&mdash;my Declaration of Rights&mdash;to peruse. In the Press, in
      Literature, at Law, and on social ground, I meet the enemy, and I claim my
      own; by heaven, I do! And I will down to the squire for a distraction, if
      you esteem it necessary, certainly. Half-a-dozen words to him. Why, do you
      maintain him to be insensible to a title for you? No, no. And ask my
      friends. I refer him to any dozen of my friends to convince him I have the
      prize almost in my possession. Why, dear boy, I have witnesses, living
      witnesses, to the ceremony. Am I, tell me, to be deprived of money now,
      once again, for the eleventh time? Oh! And put aside my duty to you, I
      protest I am bound in duty to her who bore me&mdash;you have seen her
      miniature: how lovely that dear woman was! how gentle!&mdash;bound in duty
      to her to clear her good name. This does not affect you...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, but it does,&rsquo; he allowed me to plead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, through your love for your dada.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook me by both hands. I was touched with pity, and at the same time
      in doubt whether it was not an actor that swayed me; for I was
      discontented, and could not speak my discontent; I was overborne,
      overflowed. His evasion of the matter of my objections relating to the
      princess I felt to be a palpable piece of artfulness, but I had to
      acknowledge to myself that I knew what his argument would be, and how
      overwhelmingly his defence of it would spring forth. My cowardice shrank
      from provoking a recurrence to the theme. In fact, I submitted consciously
      to his masterful fluency and emotional power, and so I was carried on the
      tide with him, remaining in London several days to witness that I was not
      the only one. My father, admitting that money served him in his conquest
      of society, and defying any other man to do as much with it as he did,
      replied to a desperate insinuation of mine, &lsquo;This money I spend I am
      actually putting out to interest as much as, or more than, your grandad.&rsquo; 
      He murmured confidentially, &lsquo;I have alarmed the Government. Indeed, I have
      warrant for saying I am in communication with its agents. They are bribing
      me; they are positively bribing me, Richie. I receive my stipend annually.
      They are mighty discreet. So am I. But I push them hard. I take what they
      offer: I renounce none of my claims.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet wrote that it would be prudent for me to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am prepared,&rsquo; my father said. &lsquo;I have only to meet Mr. Beltham in a
      room&mdash;I stipulate that it shall be between square walls&mdash;to win
      him. The squire to back us, Richie, we have command of the entire world.
      His wealth, and my good cause, and your illustrious union&mdash;by the
      way, it is announced definitely in this morning&rsquo;s paper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dismayed, I asked what was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Read,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;This will be something to hand to Mr. Beltham at our
      meeting. I might trace it to one of the embassies, Imperial or Royal. No
      matter&mdash;there it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I read a paragraph in which Ottilia&rsquo;s name and titles were set down; then
      followed mine and my wealthy heirship, and&mdash;woe was me in the
      perusing of it!&mdash;a roundabout vindication of me as one not likely to
      be ranked as the first of English commoners who had gained the hand of an
      hereditary foreign princess, though it was undoubtedly in the light of a
      commoner that I was most open to the congratulations of my countrymen upon
      my unparalleled felicity. A display of historical erudition cited the
      noble inferiors by birth who had caught princesses to their arms&mdash;Charles,
      Humphrey, William, John. Under this list, a later Harry!
    </p>
    <p>
      The paragraph closed by fixing the nuptials to take place before the end
      of the Season.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at my father to try a struggle with him. The whole man was
      efflorescent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t it be stopped?&rsquo; I implored him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He signified the impossibility in a burst of gesticulations, motions of
      the mouth, smiling frowns; various patterns of an absolute negative
      beating down opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Things printed can never be stopped, Richie. Our Jorian compares them to
      babies baptized. They have a soul from that moment, and go on for ever!&mdash;an
      admirable word of Jorian&rsquo;s. And a word to you, Richie. Will you swear to
      me by the veracity of your lover&rsquo;s heart, that paragraph affords you no
      satisfaction? He cannot swear it!&rsquo; my father exclaimed, seeing me swing my
      shoulder round, and he made me feel that it would have been a false oath
      if I had sworn it. But I could have sworn, that I had rather we two were
      at the bottom of the sea than that it should come under the princess&rsquo;s
      eyes. I read it again. It was in print. It looked like reality. It was at
      least the realization of my dream. But this played traitor and accused me
      of being crowned with no more than a dream. The sole practical thing I
      could do was to insist on our starting for Riversley immediately, to make
      sure of my own position. &lsquo;Name your hour, Richie,&rsquo; my father said
      confidently: and we waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rather plainer view of my father&rsquo;s position, as I inclined to think, was
      afforded to me one morning at his breakfast-table, by a conversation
      between him and Jorian DeWitt, who brought me a twisted pink note from
      Mdlle. Chassediane, the which he delivered with the air of a dog made to
      disgorge a bone, and he was very cool to me indeed. The cutlets of
      Alphonse were subject to snappish criticism. &lsquo;I assume,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;the
      fellow knew I was coming?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He saw it in my handwriting of yesterday,&rsquo; replied my father. &lsquo;But be
      just to him, acknowledge that he is one of the few that perform their
      daily duties with a tender conscience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This English climate has bedevilled the fellow! He peppers his dishes
      like a mongrel Indian reared on mangoes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ring him up, ring him up, Jorian. All I beg of you is not to disgust him
      with life, for he quits any service in the world to come to me, and, in
      fact, he suits me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly so: you spoil him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father shrugged. &lsquo;The state of the case is, that your stomach is
      growing delicate, friend Jorian.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The actual state of the case being, that my palate was never keener, and
      consequently my stomach knows its business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You should have tried the cold turbot with oil and capers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your man had better stick to buttered eggs, in my opinion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say, porridge!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I think he&rsquo;s equal to a bowl of porridge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Careme might have confessed to the same!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With this difference,&rsquo; cried Jorian in a heat, &lsquo;that he would never have
      allowed the thought of any of your barbarous messes to occur to a man at
      table. Let me tell you, Roy, you astonish me: up till now I have never
      known you guilty of the bad taste of defending a bad dish on your own
      board.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you will the more readily pardon me, Jorian.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I pardon you,&rsquo; Jorian sneered, tripped to the carpet by such ignoble
      mildness. &lsquo;A breakfast is no great loss.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father assured him he would have a serious conversation with Alphonse,
      for whom he apologized by saying that Alphonse had not, to his knowledge,
      served as hospital cook anywhere, and was therefore quite possibly not
      sufficiently solicitous for appetites and digestions of invalids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jorian threw back his head as though to discharge a spiteful sarcasm with
      good aim; but turning to me, said, &lsquo;Harry, the thing must be done; your
      father must marry. Notoriety is the season for a pick and choice of the
      wealthiest and the loveliest. I refuse to act the part of warming-pan any
      longer; I refuse point blank. It&rsquo;s not a personal feeling on my part; my
      advice is that of a disinterested friend, and I tell you candidly, Roy,
      set aside the absurd exhibition of my dancing attendance on that last rose
      of Guildhall,&mdash;egad, the alderman went like Summer, and left us the
      very picture of a fruity Autumn,&mdash;I say you can&rsquo;t keep her hanging on
      the tree of fond expectation for ever. She&rsquo;ll drop.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Catch her, Jorian; you are on guard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upwards of three hundred thousand, if a penny, Roy Richmond! Who? I? I am
      not a fortune-hunter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor am I, friend Jorian.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it &lsquo;s because you&rsquo;re not thorough: you &lsquo;ll fall between the stools.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father remarked that he should visit this upon Mr. Alphonse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shook off that fine Welsh girl, and she was in your hand&mdash;the
      act of a madman!&rsquo; Jorian continued. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re getting older: the day will
      come when you&rsquo;re a flat excitement. You know the first Lady Edbury spoilt
      one of your best chances when you had the market. Now you&rsquo;re trifling with
      the second. She&rsquo;s the head of the Light Brigade, but you might fix her
      down, if she&rsquo;s not too much in debt. You &lsquo;re not at the end of your run, I
      dare say. Only, my good Roy, let me tell you, in life you mustn&rsquo;t wait for
      the prize of the race till you touch the goal&mdash;if you prefer
      metaphor. You generally come forward about every seven years or so. Add on
      another seven, and women&rsquo;ll begin to think. You can&rsquo;t beat Time, mon Roy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So,&rsquo; said my father, &lsquo;I touch the goal, and women begin to think, and I
      can&rsquo;t beat time to them. Jorian, your mind is in a state of confusion. I
      do not marry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, Roy Richmond, hear what a friend says...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not marry, Jorian, and you know my reasons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sentiments!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are a part of my life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just as I remarked, you are not thorough. You have genius and courage out
      of proportion, and you are a dead failure, Roy; because, no sooner have
      you got all Covent Garden before you for the fourth or fifth time, than in
      go your hands into your pockets, and you say&mdash;No, there&rsquo;s an apple I
      can&rsquo;t have, so I&rsquo;ll none of these; and, by the way, the apple must be
      tolerably withered by this time. And you know perfectly well (for you
      don&rsquo;t lack common sense at a shaking, Roy Richmond), that you&rsquo;re guilty of
      simple madness in refusing to make the best of your situation. You haven&rsquo;t
      to be taught what money means. With money&mdash;and a wife to take care of
      it, mind you&mdash;you are pre-eminently the man for which you want to be
      recognized. Without it&mdash;Harry &lsquo;ll excuse me, I must speak plainly&mdash;you&rsquo;re
      a sort of a spectacle of a bob-cherry, down on your luck, up on your luck,
      and getting dead stale and never bitten; a familiar curiosity&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jorian added, &lsquo;Oh, by Jove! it&rsquo;s not nice to think of.&rsquo; My father said:
      &lsquo;Harry, I am sure, will excuse you for talking, in your extreme
      friendliness, of matters that he and I have not&mdash;and they interest us
      deeply&mdash;yet thought fit to discuss. And you may take my word for it,
      Jorian, that I will give Alphonse his medical dose. I am quite of your
      opinion that the kings of cooks require it occasionally. Harry will inform
      us of Mdlle. Chassediane&rsquo;s commands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The contents of the letter permitted me to read it aloud. She desired to
      know how she could be amused on the Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will undertake it,&rsquo; said my father. &lsquo;I depute the arrangements to you,
      Jorian. Respect the prejudices, and avoid collisions, that is all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain DeWitt became by convenient stages cheerful, after the pink slip
      of paper had been made common property, and from a seriously-advising
      friend, in his state of spite, relapsed to the idle and shadow-like
      associate, when pleased. I had to thank him for the gift of fresh
      perceptions. Surely it would be as well if my father could get a woman of
      fortune to take care of him!
    </p>
    <p>
      We had at my request a consultation with Dettermain and Newson on the eve
      of the journey to Riversley, Temple and Jorian DeWitt assisting. Strange
      documentary evidence was unfolded and compared with the date of a royal
      decree: affidavits of persons now dead; a ring, the ring; fans, and lace,
      and handkerchiefs with notable initials; jewelry stamped &lsquo;To the Divine
      Anastasia&rsquo; from an adoring Christian name: old brown letters that shrieked
      &lsquo;wife&rsquo; when &lsquo;charmer&rsquo; seemed to have palled; oaths of fidelity ran through
      them like bass notes. Jorian held up the discoloured sheets of ancient
      paper saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here you behold the mummy of the villain Love.&rsquo; Such love as it was&mdash;the
      love of the privileged butcher for the lamb. The burden of the letters,
      put in epigram, was rattlesnake and bird. A narrative of Anastasia&rsquo;s
      sister, Elizabeth, signed and sealed, with names of witnesses appended,
      related in brief bald English the history of the events which had killed
      her. It warmed pathetically when dwelling on the writer&rsquo;s necessity to
      part with letters and papers of greater moment, that she might be enabled
      to sustain and educate her sister&rsquo;s child. She named the certificate; she
      swore to the tampering with witnesses. The number and exact indication of
      the house where the ceremony took place was stated&mdash;a house in Soho;&mdash;the
      date was given, and the incident on that night of the rape of the
      beautiful Miss Armett by mad Lord Beaumaris at the theatre doors, aided by
      masked ruffians, after Anastasia&rsquo;s performance of Zamira.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are witnesses I know to be still living, Mr. Temple,&rsquo; my father
      said, seeing the young student-at-law silent and observant. &lsquo;One of them I
      have under my hand; I feed him. Listen to this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He read two or three insufferable sentences from one of the love-epistles,
      and broke down. I was ushered aside by a member of the firm to inspect an
      instrument prepared to bind me as surety for the costs of the appeal. I
      signed it. We quitted the attorney&rsquo;s office convinced (I speak of Temple
      and myself) that we had seen the shadow of something.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL. MY FATHER&rsquo;S MEETING WITH MY GRANDFATHER
    </h2>
    <p>
      My father&rsquo;s pleasure on the day of our journey to Bulsted was to drive me
      out of London on a lofty open chariot, with which he made the circuit of
      the fashionable districts, and caused innumerable heads to turn. I would
      have preferred to go the way of other men, to be unnoticed, but I was
      subject to an occasional glowing of undefined satisfaction in the
      observance of the universally acknowledged harmony existing between his
      pretensions, his tastes and habits, and his person. He contrived by I know
      not what persuasiveness and simplicity of manner and speech to banish from
      me the idea that he was engaged in playing a high stake; and though I knew
      it, and he more than once admitted it, there was an ease and mastery about
      him that afforded me some degree of positive comfort still. I was still
      most securely attached to his fortunes. Supposing the ghost of dead Hector
      to have hung over his body when the inflamed son of Peleus whirled him at
      his chariot wheels round Troy, he would, with his natural passions sobered
      by Erebus, have had some of my reflections upon force and fate, and my
      partial sense of exhilaration in the tremendous speed of the course during
      the whole of the period my father termed his Grand Parade. I showed just
      such acquiescence or resistance as were superinduced by the variations of
      the ground. Otherwise I was spell-bound; and beyond interdicting any
      further public mention of my name or the princess&rsquo;s, I did nothing to
      thwart him. It would have been no light matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      We struck a station at a point half-way down to Bulsted, and found little
      Kiomi there, thunder in her brows, carrying a bundle, and purchasing a
      railway-ticket, not to travel in our direction. She gave me the singular
      answer that she could not tell me where her people were; nor would she
      tell me whither she was going, alone, and by rail. I chanced to speak of
      Heriot. One of her sheet-lightning flashes shot out. &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t be at
      Bulsted,&rsquo; she said, as if that had a significance. I let her know we were
      invited to Bulsted. &lsquo;Oh, she &lsquo;s at home&rsquo;; Kiomi blinked, and her features
      twitched like whip-cord. I saw that she was possessed by one of her
      furies. That girl&rsquo;s face had the art of making me forget beautiful women,
      and what beauty was by comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that the squire came across us as we were rounding the slope
      of larch and fir plantation near a part of the Riversley hollows, leading
      to the upper heath-land, where, behind a semicircle of birches, Bulsted
      lay. He was on horseback, and called hoarsely to the captain&rsquo;s coachman,
      who was driving us, to pull up. &lsquo;Here, Harry,&rsquo; he sang out to me, in the
      same rough voice, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we should bother Captain William. It&rsquo;s
      a bit of business, not pleasure. I&rsquo;ve got the book in my pocket. You ask&mdash;is
      it convenient to step into my bailiff&rsquo;s cottage hard by, and run through
      it? Ten minutes &lsquo;ll tell me all I want to know. I want it done with. Ask.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father stood up and bowed, bareheaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather struck his hat and bobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Beltham, I trust I see you well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Better, sir, when I&rsquo;ve got rid of a damned unpleasant bit o&rsquo; business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I offer you my hearty assistance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you? Then step down and come into my bailiff&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I come, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father alighted from the carriage. The squire cast his gouty leg to be
      quit of his horse, but not in time to check my father&rsquo;s advances and
      ejaculations of condolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gout, Mr. Beltham, is a little too much a proof to us of a long line of
      ancestry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand and arm were raised in the form of a splint to support the
      squire, who glared back over his cheekbone, horrified that he could not
      escape the contact, and in too great pain from arthritic throes to
      protest: he resembled a burglar surprised by justice. &lsquo;What infernal
      nonsense,... fellow talking now?&rsquo; I heard him mutter between his hoppings
      and dancings, with one foot in the stirrup and a toe to earth, the enemy
      at his heel, and his inclination half bent upon swinging to the saddle
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to relieve him. &lsquo;Damn!... Oh, it&rsquo;s you,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire directed Uberly, acting as his groom, to walk his horse up and
      down the turf fronting young Tom Eckerthy&rsquo;s cottage, and me to remain
      where I was; then hobbled up to the door, followed at a leisurely march by
      my father. The door opened. My father swept the old man in before him,
      with a bow and flourish that admitted of no contradiction, and the door
      closed on them. I caught a glimpse of Uberly screwing his wrinkles in a
      queer grimace, while he worked his left eye and thumb expressively at the
      cottage, by way of communicating his mind to Samuel, Captain Bulsted&rsquo;s
      coachman; and I became quite of his opinion as to the nature of the
      meeting, that it was comical and not likely to lead to much. I thought of
      the princess and of my hope of her depending upon such an interview as
      this. From that hour when I stepped on the sands of the Continent to the
      day of my quitting them, I had been folded in a dream: I had stretched my
      hands to the highest things of earth, and here now was the retributive
      material money-question, like a keen scythe-blade!
    </p>
    <p>
      The cottage-door continued shut. The heaths were darkening. I heard a
      noise of wheels, and presently the unmistakable voice of Janet saying,
      &lsquo;That must be Harry.&rsquo; She was driving my aunt Dorothy. Both of them hushed
      at hearing that the momentous duel was in progress. Janet&rsquo;s first thought
      was of the squire. &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t have him ride home in the dark,&rsquo; she said, and
      ordered Uberly to walk the horse home. The ladies had a ladies&rsquo; 
      altercation before Janet would permit my aunt to yield her place and
      proceed on foot, accompanied by me. Naturally the best driver of the two
      kept the whip. I told Samuel to go on to Bulsted, with word that we were
      coming: and Janet, nodding bluntly, agreed to direct my father as to where
      he might expect to find me on the Riversley road. My aunt Dorothy and I
      went ahead slowly: at her request I struck a pathway to avoid the
      pony-carriage, which was soon audible; and when Janet, chattering to the
      squire, had gone by, we turned back to intercept my father. He was
      speechless at the sight of Dorothy Beltham. At his solicitation, she
      consented to meet him next day; his account of the result of the interview
      was unintelligible to her as well as to me. Even after leaving her at the
      park-gates, I could get nothing definite from him, save that all was well,
      and that the squire was eminently practical; but he believed he had done
      an excellent evening&rsquo;s work. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said he, rubbing his hands,
      &lsquo;excellent! making due allowances for the emphatically commoner&rsquo;s mind we
      have to deal with.&rsquo; And then to change the subject he dilated on that
      strange story of the man who, an enormous number of years back in the date
      of the world&rsquo;s history, carried his little son on his shoulders one night
      when the winds were not so boisterous, though we were deeper in Winter,
      along the identical road we traversed, between the gorsemounds, across the
      heaths, with yonder remembered fir-tree clump in sight and the waste-water
      visible to footfarers rounding under the firs. At night-time he vowed,
      that as far as nature permitted it, he had satisfied the squire&mdash;&lsquo;completely
      satisfied him, I mean,&rsquo; he said, to give me sound sleep. &lsquo;No doubt of it;
      no doubt of it, Richie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He won Julia&rsquo;s heart straight off, and Captain Bulsted&rsquo;s profound
      admiration. &lsquo;Now I know the man I&rsquo;ve always been adoring since you were so
      high, Harry,&rsquo; said she. Captain Bulsted sighed: &lsquo;Your husband bows to your
      high good taste, my dear.&rsquo; They relished him sincerely, and between them
      and him I suffered myself to be dandled once more into a state of
      credulity, until I saw my aunt Dorothy in the afternoon subsequent to the
      appointed meeting. His deep respect and esteem for her had stayed him from
      answering any of her questions falsely. To that extent he had been
      veracious. It appeared, that driven hard by the squire, who would have no
      waving of flags and lighting of fireworks in a matter of business, and
      whose &lsquo;commoner&rsquo;s mind&rsquo; chafed sturdily at a hint of the necessity for
      lavish outlays where there was a princess to win, he had rallied on the
      fiction that many of the cheques, standing for the bulk of the sums
      expended, were moneys borrowed by him of me, which he designed to repay,
      and was prepared to repay instantly&mdash;could in fact, the squire
      demanding it, repay, as it were, on the spot; for behold, these borrowed
      moneys were not spent; they were moneys invested in undertakings, put out
      to high rates of interest; moneys that perhaps it would not be adviseable
      to call in without a season of delay; still, if Mr. Beltham, acting for
      his grandson and heir, insisted, it should be done. The moneys had been
      borrowed purely to invest them with profit on my behalf: a gentleman&rsquo;s
      word of honour was pledged to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire grimly gave him a couple of months to make it good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy Beltham and my father were together for about an hour at
      Eckerthy&rsquo;s farm. She let my father kiss her hand when he was bending to
      take his farewell of her, but held her face away. He was in manifest
      distress, hardly master of his voice, begged me to come to him soon, and
      bowing, with &lsquo;God bless you, madam, my friend on earth!&rsquo; turned his heel,
      bearing his elastic frame lamentably. A sad or a culprit air did not befit
      him: one reckoned up his foibles and errors when seeing him under a partly
      beaten aspect. At least, I did; not my dear aunt, who was compassionate of
      him, however thoroughly she condemned his ruinous extravagance, and the
      shifts and evasions it put him to. She feared, that instead of mending the
      difficulty, he had postponed merely to exaggerate it in the squire&rsquo;s mind;
      and she was now of opinion that the bringing him down to meet the squire
      was very bad policy, likely to result in danger to my happiness; for, if
      the money should not be forthcoming on the date named, all my father&rsquo;s
      faults would be transferred to me as his accomplice, both in the original
      wastefulness and the subterfuges invented to conceal it. I recollected
      that a sum of money had really been sunk in Prince Ernest&rsquo;s coal-mine. My
      aunt said she hoped for the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mounting the heaths, we looked back on the long yellow road, where the
      carriage conveying my father to the railway-station was visible, and
      talked of him, and of the elements of antique tragedy in his history,
      which were at that period, let me say, precisely what my incessant mental
      efforts were strained to expel from the idea of our human life. The
      individual&rsquo;s freedom was my tenet of faith; but pity pleaded for him that
      he was well-nigh irresponsible, was shamefully sinned against at his
      birth, one who could charge the Gods with vindictiveness, and complain of
      the persecution of natal Furies. My aunt Dorothy advised me to take him
      under my charge, and sell his house and furniture, make him live in
      bachelor chambers with his faithful waiting-woman and a single manservant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He will want money even to do that,&rsquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She murmured, &lsquo;Is there not some annual income paid to him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her quick delicacy made her redden in alluding so closely to his personal
      affairs, and I loved her for the nice feeling. &lsquo;It was not much,&rsquo; I said.
      The miserable attempt to repair the wrongs done to him with this small
      annuity angered me&mdash;and I remembered, little pleased, the foolish
      expectations he founded on this secret acknowledgement of the justice of
      his claims. &lsquo;We won&rsquo;t talk of it,&rsquo; I pursued. &lsquo;I wish he had never touched
      it. I shall interdict him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would let him pay his debts with it, Harry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not sure, aunty, that he does not incur a greater debt by accepting
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One&rsquo;s wish would be, that he might not ever be in need of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, or never be caring to find the key of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That must be waste of time,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I meant something else, but it was useless to tell her so.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI. COMMENCEMENT OF THE SPLENDOURS AND PERPLEXITIES OF MY
      FATHER&rsquo;S GRAND
    </h2>
    <p>
      PARADE
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet, in reply to our inquiries as to the condition of the squire&rsquo;s
      temper, pointed out in the newspaper a notification of a grand public Ball
      to be given by my father, the first of a series of three, and said that
      the squire had seen it and shrugged. She thought there was no positive
      cause for alarm, even though my father should fail of his word; but
      expressed her view decidedly, that it was an unfortunate move to bring him
      between the squire and me, and so she blamed Captain Bulsted. This was
      partly for the reason that the captain and his wife, charmed by my father,
      were for advocating his merits at the squire&rsquo;s table: our ingenuity was
      ludicrously taxed to mystify him on the subject of their extravagant
      eulogies. They told him they had been invited, and were going to the great
      London Balls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Subscription Balls?&rsquo; asked the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; rejoined the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tradesmen&rsquo;s Balls, d&rsquo; ye call &lsquo;em, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir; they are Balls given by a distinguished gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care it&rsquo;s not another name for tradesmen&rsquo;s Balls, William.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not attend tradesmen&rsquo;s Balls, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care o&rsquo; that, William.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain was very angry. &lsquo;What,&rsquo; said he, turning to us, &lsquo;what does the
      squire mean by telling an officer of the Royal Navy that he is conducting
      his wife to a tradesmen&rsquo;s Ball?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia threatened malicious doings for the insult. She and the squire had a
      controversy upon the explication of the word gentleman, she describing my
      father&rsquo;s appearance and manners to the life. &lsquo;Now listen to me, squire. A
      gentleman, I say, is one you&rsquo;d say, if he wasn&rsquo;t born a duke, he ought to
      have been, and more shame to the title! He turns the key of a lady&rsquo;s heart
      with a twinkle of his eye. He &lsquo;s never mean&mdash;what he has is yours.
      He&rsquo;s a true friend; and if he doesn&rsquo;t keep his word, you know in a jiffy
      it&rsquo;s the fault of affairs; and stands about five feet eleven: he&rsquo;s a
      full-blown man&rsquo;: and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire listened, and perspired at finding the object of his abhorrence
      crowned thus in the unassailable realms of the abstract. Julia might have
      done it more elegantly; but her husband was rapturous over her skill in
      portraiture, and he added: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a gentleman, squire; and that &lsquo;s a man
      pretty sure to be abused by half the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Three-quarters, William,&rsquo; said the squire; &lsquo;there&rsquo;s about the computation
      for your gentleman&rsquo;s creditors, I suspect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, sir; well,&rsquo; returned the captain, to whom this kind of fencing in the
      dark was an affliction, &lsquo;we make it up in quality&mdash;in quality.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I &lsquo;ll be bound you do,&rsquo; said the squire; &lsquo;and so you will so long as you
      &lsquo;re only asked to dance to the other poor devils&rsquo; fiddling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Bulsted bowed. &lsquo;The last word to you, squire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire nodded. &lsquo;I &lsquo;ll hand it to your wife, William.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia took it graciously. &lsquo;A perfect gentleman! perfect! confound his
      enemies!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am, you might keep from swearing,&rsquo; the squire bawled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;La! squire,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;why, don&rsquo;t you know the National Anthem?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;National Anthem, ma&rsquo;am! and a fellow, a velvet-tongued&mdash;confound
      him, if you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And where&rsquo;s my last word, if you please?&rsquo; Julia jumped up, and dropped a
      provoking curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You silly old grandada!&rsquo; said Janet, going round to him; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you see
      the cunning woman wants to dress you in our garments, and means to boast
      of it to us while you&rsquo;re finishing your wine?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man fondled her. I could have done the same, she bent over him
      with such homely sweetness. &lsquo;One comfort, you won&rsquo;t go to these
      gingerbread Balls,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not invited,&rsquo; she moaned comically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; nor shan&rsquo;t be, while I can keep you out of bad company.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, grandada, I do like dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dance away, my dear; I&rsquo;ve no objection.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But where&rsquo;s the music?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you can always have music.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But where are my partners?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire pointed at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t want more than one at a time, eh?&rsquo; He corrected his error: &lsquo;No,
      the fellow&rsquo;s engaged in another quadrille. Mind you, Miss Janet, he shall
      dance to your tune yet. D&rsquo; ye hear, sir?&rsquo; The irritation excited by
      Captain Bulsted and Julia broke out in fury. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that fellow danced
      when Rome was burning?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Emperor Nero,&rsquo; said Janet. &lsquo;He killed Harry&rsquo;s friend Seneca in the
      eighty-somethingth year of his age; an old man, and&mdash;hush, grandada!&rsquo; 
      She could not check him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hark you, Mr. Harry; dance your hardest up in town with your rips and
      reps, and the lot of ye; all very fine while the burning goes on: you
      won&rsquo;t see the fun of dancing on the ashes. A nice king of Rome Nero was
      next morning! By the Lord, if I couldn&rsquo;t swear you&rsquo;ll be down on your
      knees to an innocent fresh-hearted girl &lsquo;s worth five hundred of the crew
      you&rsquo;re for partnering now while you&rsquo;ve a penny for the piper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet shut his mouth, kissed him, and held his wine up. He drank, and
      thumped the table. &lsquo;We &lsquo;ll have parties here, too. The girl shall have her
      choice of partners: she shan&rsquo;t be kept in the background by a young
      donkey. Take any six of your own age, and six sensible men, to try you by
      your chances. By George, the whole dozen &lsquo;d bring you in non-compos.
      You&rsquo;ve only got the women on your side because of a smart face and
      figure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet exclaimed indignantly, &lsquo;Grandada, I&rsquo;m offended with you&rsquo;; and walked
      out on a high step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, if he has the women on his side,&rsquo; said Captain Bulsted, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll be able to go partnering and gallopading as long as his banker &lsquo;ll
      let him, William&mdash;like your gentleman! That&rsquo;s true. We shall soon
      see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I leave my character in your hands, sir,&rsquo; said I, rising. &lsquo;If you would
      scold me in private, I should prefer it, on behalf of your guests; but I
      am bound to submit to your pleasure, and under any circumstances I
      remember, what you appear to forget, that you are my grandfather.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, I followed the ladies. It was not the wisest of speeches, and
      happened, Captain Bulsted informed me, to be delivered in my father&rsquo;s
      manner, for the squire pronounced emphatically that he saw very little
      Beltham in me. The right course would have been for me to ask him then and
      there whether I had his consent to start for Germany. But I was the sport
      of resentments and apprehensions; and, indeed, I should not have gone. I
      could not go without some title beyond that of the heir of great riches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet kept out of my sight. I found myself strangely anxious to console
      her: less sympathetic, perhaps, than desirous to pour out my sympathy in
      her ear, which was of a very pretty shape, with a soft unpierced lobe. We
      danced together at the Riversley Ball, given by the squire on the night of
      my father&rsquo;s Ball in London. Janet complimented me upon having attained
      wisdom. &lsquo;Now we get on well,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Grandada only wants to see us
      friendly, and feel that I am not neglected.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man, a martyr to what he considered due to his favourite, endured
      the horror of the Ball until suppertime, and kept his eyes on us two. He
      forgot, or pretended to forget, my foreign engagement altogether, though
      the announcement in the newspapers was spoken of by Sir Roderick and Lady
      Echester and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you like that?&rsquo; he remarked to me, seeing her twirled away by one
      of the young Rubreys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She seems to like it, sir,&rsquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like it!&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;In my day you wouldn&rsquo;t have caught me letting the
      bloom be taken off the girl I cared for by a parcel o&rsquo; scampish young
      dogs. Right in their arms! Look at her build. She&rsquo;s strong; she&rsquo;s healthy;
      she goes round like a tower. If you want a girl to look like a princess!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His eulogies were not undeserved. But she danced as lightly and happily
      with Mr. Fred Rubrey as with Harry Richmond. I congratulated myself on her
      lack of sentiment. Later, when in London, where Mlle. Jenny Chassediane
      challenged me to perilous sarabandes, I wished that Janet had ever so
      small a grain of sentiment, for a preservative to me. Ottilia glowed high
      and distant; she sent me no message; her image did not step between me and
      disorder. The whole structure of my idea of my superior nature seemed to
      be crumbling to fragments; and beginning to feel in despair that I was
      wretchedly like other men, I lost by degrees the sense of my hold on her.
      It struck me that my worst fears of the effect produced on the princess&rsquo;s
      mind by that last scene in the lake-palace must be true, and I abandoned
      hope. Temple thought she tried me too cruelly. Under these circumstances I
      became less and less resolutely disposed to renew the forlorn conflict
      with my father concerning his prodigal way of living. &lsquo;Let it last as long
      as I have a penny to support him!&rsquo; I exclaimed. He said that Dettermain
      and Newson were now urging on his case with the utmost despatch in order
      to keep pace with him, but that the case relied for its life on his
      preserving a great appearance. He handed me his division of our twin
      cheque-books, telling me he preferred to depend on his son for supplies,
      and I was in the mood to think this a partial security.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you can take what there is,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the contrary, I will accept nothing but minor sums&mdash;so to speak,
      the fractional shillings; though I confess I am always bewildered by
      silver,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      I questioned him upon his means of carrying on his expenditure. His answer
      was to refer to the pavement of the city of London. By paving here and
      there he had, he informed me, made a concrete for the wheels to roll on.
      He calculated that he now had credit for the space of three new years&mdash;ample
      time for him to fight his fight and win his victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My tradesmen are not like the tradesmen of other persons,&rsquo; he broke out
      with a curious neigh of supreme satisfaction in that retinue. &lsquo;They
      believe in me. I have de facto harnessed them to my fortunes; and if you
      doubt me on the point of success, I refer you to Dettermain and Newson.
      All I stipulate for is to maintain my position in society to throw a
      lustre on my Case. So much I must do. My failures hitherto have been
      entirely owing to the fact that I had not my son to stand by me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you must have money, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then what can you mean by refusing mine?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I admit the necessity for it, my son. Say you hand me a cheque for a
      temporary thousand. Your credit and mine in conjunction can replace it
      before the expiration of the two months. Or,&rsquo; he meditated, &lsquo;it might be
      better to give a bond or so to a professional lender, and preserve the
      account at your bankers intact. The truth is, I have, in my interview with
      the squire, drawn in advance upon the material success I have a perfect
      justification to anticipate, and I cannot allow the old gentleman to
      suppose that I retrench for the purpose of giving a large array of figures
      to your bankers&rsquo; book. It would be sheer madness. I cannot do it. I cannot
      afford to do it. When you are on a runaway horse, I prefer to say a
      racehorse,&mdash;Richie, you must ride him. You dare not throw up the
      reins. Only last night Wedderburn, appealing to Loftus, a practical
      sailor, was approved when he offered&mdash;I forget the subject-matter&mdash;the
      illustration of a ship on a lee-shore; you are lost if you do not spread
      every inch of canvas to the gale. Retrenchment at this particular moment
      is perdition. Count our gains, Richie. We have won a princess...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I called to him not to name her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He persisted: &lsquo;Half a minute. She is won; she is ours. And let me, in
      passing,&mdash;bear with me one second&mdash;counsel you to write to
      Prince Ernest instanter, proposing formally for his daughter, and, in your
      grandfather&rsquo;s name, state her dowry at fifty thousand per annum.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you forget!&rsquo; I interjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Richie, I do not forget that you are off a leeshore; you are mounted
      on a skittish racehorse, with, if you like, a New Forest fly operating
      within an inch of his belly-girths. Our situation is so far ticklish, and
      prompts invention and audacity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must forget, sir, that in the present state of the squire&rsquo;s mind, I
      should be simply lying in writing to the prince that he offers a dowry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, for your grandfather has yielded consent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By implication, you know he withdraws it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if I satisfy him that you have not been extravagant?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must wait till he is satisfied.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The thing is done, Richie, done. I see it in advance&mdash;it is done!
      Whatever befalls me, you, my dear boy, in the space of two months, may
      grasp&mdash;your fortune. Besides, here is my hand. I swear by it, my son,
      that I shall satisfy the squire. I go farther; I say I shall have the
      means to refund to you&mdash;the means, the money. The marriage is
      announced in our prints for the Summer&mdash;say early June. And I
      undertake that you, the husband of the princess, shall be the first
      gentleman in England&mdash;that is, Europe. Oh! not ruling a coterie: not
      dazzling the world with entertainments.&rsquo; He thought himself in earnest
      when he said, &lsquo;I attach no mighty importance to these things, though there
      is no harm I can perceive in leading the fashion&mdash;none that I see in
      having a consummate style. I know your taste, and hers, Richie, the noble
      lady&rsquo;s. She shall govern the intellectual world&mdash;your poets, your
      painters, your men of science. They reflect a beautiful sovereign mistress
      more exquisitely than almost aristocracy does. But you head our
      aristocracy also. You are a centre of the political world. So I scheme it.
      Between you, I defy the Court to rival you. This I call distinction. It is
      no mean aim, by heaven! I protest, it is an aim with the mark in sight,
      and not out of range.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He whipped himself up to one of his oratorical frenzies, of which a cheque
      was the common fruit. The power of his persuasiveness in speech, backed by
      the spectacle of his social accomplishments, continued to subdue me, and I
      protested only inwardly even when I knew that he was gambling with
      fortune. I wrote out many cheques, and still it appeared to me that they
      were barely sufficient to meet the current expenses of his household.
      Temple and I calculated that his Grand Parade would try the income of a
      duke, and could but be a matter of months. Mention of it reached Riversley
      from various quarters, from Lady Maria Higginson, from Captain Bulsted and
      his wife, and from Sir Roderick Ilchester, who said to me, with fine
      accentuation, &lsquo;I have met your father.&rsquo; Sir Roderick, an Englishman
      reputed of good breeding, informed the son that he had actually met the
      father in lofty society, at Viscountess Sedley&rsquo;s, at Lady Dolchester&rsquo;s, at
      Bramham DeWitt&rsquo;s, and heard of him as a frequenter of the Prussian and
      Austrian Embassy entertainments; and also that he was admitted to the
      exclusive dinner-parties of the Countess de Strode, &lsquo;which are,&rsquo; he
      observed, in the moderated tone of an astonishment devoting itself to
      propagation, &lsquo;the cream of society.&rsquo; Indubitably, then, my father was an
      impostor: more Society proved it. The squire listened like one pelted by a
      storm, sure of his day to come at the close of the two months. I gained
      his commendation by shunning the metropolitan Balls, nor did my father
      press me to appear at them. It was tacitly understood between us that I
      should now and then support him at his dinner-table, and pass bowing among
      the most select of his great ladies. And this I did, and I felt at home
      with them, though I had to bear with roughnesses from one or two of the
      more venerable dames, which were not quite proper to good breeding. Old
      Lady Kane, great-aunt of the Marquis of Edbury, was particularly my
      tormentor, through her plain-spoken comments on my father&rsquo;s legal suit;
      for I had to listen to her without wincing, and agree in her general
      contempt of the Georges, and foil her queries coolly, when I should have
      liked to perform Jorian DeWitt&rsquo;s expressed wish to &lsquo;squeeze the acid out
      of her in one grip, and toss her to the Gods that collect exhausted
      lemons.&rsquo; She took extraordinary liberties with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not marry an Englishwoman? Rich young men ought to choose wives from
      their own people, out of their own sets. Foreign women never get on well
      in this country, unless they join the hounds to hunt the husband.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She cited naturalized ladies famous for the pastime. Her world and its
      outskirts she knew thoroughly, even to the fact of my grandfather&rsquo;s desire
      that I should marry Janet Ilchester. She named a duke&rsquo;s daughter, an
      earl&rsquo;s. Of course I should have to stop the scandal: otherwise the choice
      I had was unrestricted. My father she evidently disliked, but she just as
      much disliked an encounter with his invincible bonhomie and dexterous
      tongue. She hinted at family reasons for being shy of him, assuring me
      that I was not implicated in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Guelph pattern was never much to my taste,&rsquo; she said, and it consoled
      me with the thought that he was not ranked as an adventurer in the houses
      he entered. I learned that he was supposed to depend chiefly on my vast
      resources. Edbury acted the part of informant to the inquisitive harridan:
      &lsquo;Her poor dear good-for-nothing Edbury! whose only cure would be a nice,
      well-conducted girl, an heiress.&rsquo; She had cast her eye on Anna Penrhys,
      but considered her antecedents doubtful. Spotless innocence was the sole
      receipt for Edbury&rsquo;s malady. My father, in a fit of bold irony, proposed
      Lady Kane for President of his Tattle and Scandal Club,&mdash;a club of
      ladies dotted with select gentlemen, the idea of which Jorian DeWitt
      claimed the merit of starting, and my father surrendered it to him, with
      the reservation, that Jorian intended an association of backbiters pledged
      to reveal all they knew, whereas the Club, in its present form, was an
      engine of morality and decency, and a social safeguard, as well as an
      amusement. It comprised a Committee of Investigation, and a Court of
      Appeal; its object was to arraign slander. Lady Kane declined the honour.
      &lsquo;I am not a washerwoman,&rsquo; she said to me, and spoke of where dirty linen
      should be washed, and was distressingly broad in her innuendoes concerning
      Edbury&rsquo;s stepmother. This Club sat and became a terror for a month, adding
      something to my father&rsquo;s reputation. His inexhaustible conversational art
      and humour gave it such vitality as it had. Ladies of any age might apply
      for admission when well seconded: gentlemen under forty-five years were
      rigidly excluded, and the seniors must also have passed through the
      marriage ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside tattle and scandal declared, that the Club was originated to serve
      as a club for Lady Edbury, but I chose to have no opinion upon what I knew
      nothing of.
    </p>
    <p>
      These matters were all ephemeral, and freaks; they produced, however,
      somewhat of the same effect on me as on my father, in persuading me that
      he was born for the sphere he occupied, and rendering me rather callous as
      to the sources of ways and means. I put my name to a bond for several
      thousand pounds, in conjunction with Lord Edbury, thinking my father right
      in wishing to keep my cheque-book unworried, lest the squire should be
      seized with a spasm of curiosity before the two months were over. &lsquo;I
      promise you I surprise him,&rsquo; my father said repeatedly. He did not say
      how: I had the suspicion that he did not know. His confidence and my
      growing recklessness acted in unison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily the newspapers were quiet. I hoped consequently to find peace at
      Riversley; but there the rumours of the Grand Parade were fabulous, thanks
      to Captain Bulsted and Julia, among others. These two again provoked an
      outbreak of rage from the squire, and I, after hearing them, was almost
      disposed to side with him; they suggested an inexplicable magnificence,
      and created an image of a man portentously endowed with the capacity to
      throw dust in the eyes. No description of the Balls could have furnished
      me with such an insight of their brilliancy as the consuming ardour they
      awakened in the captain and his wife. He reviewed them: &lsquo;Princely
      entertainments! Arabian Nights!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She built them up piecemeal: &lsquo;The company! the dresses! the band! the
      supper!&rsquo; The host was a personage supernatural. &lsquo;Aladdin&rsquo;s magician, if
      you like,&rsquo; said Julia, &lsquo;only-good! A perfect gentleman! and I&rsquo;ll say
      again, confound his enemies.&rsquo; She presumed, as she was aware she might do,
      upon the squire&rsquo;s prepossession in her favour, without reckoning that I
      was always the victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heard o&rsquo; that new story &lsquo;bout a Dauphin?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A Dauphin?&rsquo; quoth Captain Bulsted. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know the fish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been in a pretty kettle of &lsquo;em lately, William. I heard of it
      yesterday on the Bench. Lord Shale, our new Lord-Lieutenant, brought it
      down. A trick they played the fellow &lsquo;bout a Dauphin. Serve him right. You
      heard anything &lsquo;bout it, Harry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I tell ye there is a Dauphin mixed up with him. A Dauphin and Mr. Ik
      Dine!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Ik Dine!&rsquo; exclaimed the captain, perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, that&rsquo;s German lingo, William, and you ought to know it if you&rsquo;re a
      loyal sailor&mdash;means &ldquo;I serve.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Beltham,&rsquo; said the captain, seriously, &lsquo;I give you my word of honour
      as a man and a British officer, I don&rsquo;t understand one syllable of what
      you&rsquo;re saying; but if it means any insinuation against the gentleman who
      condescends to extend his hospitalities to my wife and me, I must, with
      regret, quit the place where I have had the misfortune to hear it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You stop where you are, William,&rsquo; the squire motioned to him. &lsquo;Gad, I
      shall have to padlock my mouth, or I shan&rsquo;t have a friend left soon...
      confounded fellow... I tell you they call him Mr. Ik Dine in town. Ik Dine
      and a Dauphin! They made a regular clown and pantaloon o&rsquo; the pair, I&rsquo;m
      told. Couple o&rsquo; pretenders to Thrones invited to dine together and talk
      over their chances and show their private marks. Oho! by-and-by, William!
      You and I! Never a man made such a fool of in his life!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies retired. The squire continued, in a furious whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They got the two together, William. Who are you? I&rsquo;m a Dauphin; who are
      you? I&rsquo;m Ik Dine, bar sinister. Oh! says the other, then I take precedence
      of you! Devil a bit, says the other; I&rsquo;ve got more spots than you. Proof,
      says one. You first, t&rsquo; other. Count, one cries. T&rsquo; other sings out,
      Measles. Better than a dying Dauphin, roars t&rsquo; other; and swore both of &lsquo;m
      &lsquo;twas nothing but Port-wine stains and pimples. Ha! ha! And, William, will
      you believe it?&mdash;the couple went round begging the company to count
      spots&mdash;ha! ha! to prove their big birth! Oh, Lord, I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; paid a
      penny to be there! A Jack o&rsquo; Bedlam Ik Dine damned idiot!&mdash;makes name
      o&rsquo; Richmond stink.&rsquo; (Captain Bulsted shot a wild stare round the room to
      make sure that the ladies had gone.) &lsquo;I tell ye, William, I had it from
      Lord Shale himself only yesterday on the Bench. He brought it to us hot
      from town&mdash;didn&rsquo;t know I knew the fellow; says the fellow&rsquo;s charging
      and firing himself off all day and all night too-can&rsquo;t make him out. Says
      London&rsquo;s mad about him: lots o&rsquo; women, the fools! Ha, ha! a Dauphin!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, well, sir,&rsquo; Captain Bulsted supplicated feverishly, rubbing his brows
      and whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It &lsquo;s true, William. Fellow ought to be taken up and committed as a
      common vagabond, and would be anywhere but in London. I&rsquo;d jail him &lsquo;fore
      you cocked your eye twice. Fellow came here and talked me over to grant
      him a couple o&rsquo; months to prove he hasn&rsquo;t swindled his son of every scrap
      of his money. We shall soon see. Not many weeks to run! And pretends&mdash;fellow
      swears to me&mdash;can get him into Parliament; swears he&rsquo;ll get him in
      &lsquo;fore the two months are over! An infernal&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please to recollect, sir; the old hereditary shall excuse you&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gout, you mean, William? By&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are speaking in the presence of his son, sir, and you are trying the
      young gentleman&rsquo;s affection for you hard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh? &lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m his friend? Harry,&rsquo; my grandfather faced round on me,
      &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you know I &lsquo;m the friend you can trust? Hal, did I ever borrow a
      farthing of you? Didn&rsquo;t I, the day of your majority, hand you the whole of
      your inheritance from your poor broken-hearted mother, with interest, and
      treat you like a man? And never played spy, never made an inquiry, till I
      heard the scamp had been fastening on you like a blood-sucker, and singing
      hymns into the ears of that squeamish dolt of a pipe-smoking parson,
      Peterborough&mdash;never thought of doing it! Am I the man that dragged
      your grandmother&rsquo;s name through the streets and soiled yours?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I remarked that I was sensible of the debt of gratitude I owed to him, but
      would rather submit to the scourge, or to destitution, than listen to
      these attacks on my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cut yourself loose, Harry,&rsquo; he cried, a trifle mollified. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t season
      his stew&mdash;d&rsquo; ye hear? Stick to decent people. Why, you don&rsquo;t expect
      he&rsquo;ll be locked up in the Tower for a finish, eh? It&rsquo;ll be Newgate, or the
      Bench. He and his Dauphin&mdash;ha! ha! A rascal crow and a Jack Dauphin!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Bulsted reached me his hand. &lsquo;You have a great deal to bear,
      Harry. I commend you, my boy, for taking it manfully.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say no more,&rsquo; quoth the squire. &lsquo;But what I said was true. The fellow
      gives his little dinners and suppers to his marchionesses, countesses,
      duchesses, and plays clown and pantaloon among the men. He thinks a parcel
      o&rsquo; broidered petticoats &lsquo;ll float him. So they may till a tradesman sent
      stark mad pops a pin into him. Harry, I&rsquo;d as lief hang on to a fire-ship.
      Here&rsquo;s Ilchester tells me... and Ilchester speaks of him under his breath
      now as if he were sitting in a pew funking the parson. Confound the
      fellow! I say he&rsquo;s guilty of treason. Pooh! who cares! He cuts out the
      dandies of his day, does he? He&rsquo;s past sixty, if he&rsquo;s a month. It&rsquo;s all
      damned harlequinade. Let him twirl off one columbine or another, or a
      dozen, and then&mdash;the last of him! Fellow makes the world look like a
      farce. He &lsquo;s got about eight feet by five to caper on, and all London
      gaping at him&mdash;geese! Are you a gentleman and a man of sense, Harry
      Richmond, to let yourself be lugged about in public&mdash;by the Lord!
      like a pair of street-tumblers in spangled haunch-bags, father and boy, on
      a patch of carpet, and a drum banging, and tossed and turned inside out,
      and my God! the ass of a fellow strutting the ring with you on his
      shoulder! That&rsquo;s the spectacle. And you, Harry, now I &lsquo;ll ask you, do you
      mean your wife&mdash;egad, it&rsquo;d be a pretty scene, with your princess in
      hip-up petticoats, stiff as bottle-funnel top down&rsquo;ards, airing a whole
      leg, and knuckling a tambourine!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not crying, my dear lad?&rsquo; Captain Bulsted put his arm round me kindly,
      and tried to catch a glimpse of my face. I let him see I was not going
      through that process. &lsquo;Whew!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and enough to make any Christian
      sweat! You&rsquo;re in a bath, Harry. I wouldn&rsquo;t expect the man who murdered his
      godmother for one shilling and fivepence three-farthings the other day, to
      take such a slinging, and think he deserved it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My power of endurance had reached its limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You tell me, sir, you had this brutal story from the Lord-Lieutenant of
      the county?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, from Lord Shale. But I won&rsquo;t have you going to him and betraying our
      connection with a&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Halloo!&rsquo; Captain Bulsted sang out to his wife on the lawn. &lsquo;And now,
      squire, I have had my dose. And you will permit me to observe, that I find
      it emphatically what we used to call at school black-jack.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you were all the better for it afterwards, William.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We did not arrive at that opinion, sir. Harry, your arm. An hour with the
      ladies will do us both good. The squire,&rsquo; he murmured, wiping his forehead
      as he went out, &lsquo;has a knack of bringing us into close proximity with
      hell-fire when he pleases.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia screamed on beholding us, &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you two men as pale as death!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet came and looked. &lsquo;Merely a dose,&rsquo; said the captain. &lsquo;We are anxious
      to play battledore and shuttlecock madly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So he shall, the dear!&rsquo; Julia caressed him. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll all have a tournament
      in the wet-weather shed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet whispered to me, &lsquo;Was it&mdash;the Returning Thanks?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The what?&rsquo; said I, with the dread at my heart of something worse than I
      had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hailed Julia to run and fetch the battledores, and then told me she
      had been obliged to confiscate the newspapers that morning and cast the
      burden on post-office negligence. &lsquo;They reach grandada&rsquo;s hands by
      afternoon post, Harry, and he finds objectionable passages blotted or cut
      out; and as long as the scissors don&rsquo;t touch the business columns and the
      debates, he never asks me what I have been doing. He thinks I keep a
      scrap-book. I haven&rsquo;t often time in the morning to run an eye all over the
      paper. This morning it was the first thing I saw.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      What had she seen? She led me out of view of the windows and showed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father was accused of having stood up at a public dinner and returned
      thanks on behalf of an Estate of the Realm: it read monstrously. I ceased
      to think of the suffering inflicted on me by my grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet and I, side by side with the captain and Julia, carried on the game
      of battledore and shuttlecock, in a match to see whether the unmarried
      could keep the shuttle flying as long as the married, with varying
      fortunes. She gazed on me, to give me the comfort of her sympathy, too
      much, and I was too intent on the vision of my father either persecuted by
      lies or guilty of hideous follies, to allow the match to be a fair one. So
      Julia could inform the squire that she and William had given the unmarried
      pair a handsome beating, when he appeared peeping round one of the
      shed-pillars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course you beat &lsquo;em,&rsquo; said the squire. &lsquo;It &lsquo;s not my girl&rsquo;s fault.&rsquo; He
      said more, to the old tune, which drove Janet away.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remembered, when back in the London vortex, the curious soft beauty she
      won from casting up her eyes to watch the descending feathers, and the
      brilliant direct beam of those thick-browed, firm, clear eyes, with her
      frown, and her set lips and brave figure, when she was in the act of
      striking to keep up a regular quick fusilade. I had need of calm memories.
      The town was astir, and humming with one name.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLII. THE MARQUIS OF EDBURY AND HIS PUPPET
    </h2>
    <p>
      I passed from man to man, hearing hints and hesitations, alarming
      half-remarks, presumed to be addressed to one who could supply the
      remainder, and deduce consequences. There was a clearer atmosphere in the
      street of Clubs. Jennings was the first of my father&rsquo;s more intimate
      acquaintances to meet me frankly. He spoke, though not with great
      seriousness, of the rumour of a possible prosecution. Sir Weeton Slater
      tripped up to us with a mixed air of solicitude and restraint, asked
      whether I was well, and whether I had seen the newspapers that morning;
      and on my informing him that I had just come up from Riversley, on account
      of certain rumours, advised me to remain in town strictly for the present.
      He also hinted at rumours of prosecutions. &lsquo;The fact is&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; he
      began several times, rendered discreet, I suppose, by my juvenility,
      fierte, and reputed wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were joined by Admiral Loftus and Lord Alton. They queried and
      counterqueried as to passages between my father and the newspapers, my
      father and the committee of his Club, preserving sufficient consideration
      for me to avoid the serious matter in all but distant allusions; a point
      upon which the breeding of Mr. Serjeant Wedderburn was not so accurate a
      guide to him. An exciting public scandal soon gathers knots of gossips in
      Clubland. We saw Wedderburn break from a group some way down the pavement
      and pick up a fresh crumb of amusement at one of the doorsteps. &lsquo;Roy
      Richmond is having his benefit to-day!&rsquo; he said, and repeated this and
      that, half audible to me. For the rest, he pooh-poohed the idea of the Law
      intervening. His &lsquo;How d&rsquo; ye do, Mr. Richmond, how d&rsquo; ye do?&rsquo; was almost
      congratulatory. &lsquo;I think we meet at your father&rsquo;s table to-night? It won&rsquo;t
      be in the Tower, take my word for it. Oh! the papers! There&rsquo;s no Act to
      compel a man to deny what appears in the papers. No such luck as the
      Tower!&mdash;though Littlepitt (Mr. Wedderburn&rsquo;s nickname for our Premier)
      would be fool enough for that. He would. If he could turn attention from
      his Bill, he&rsquo;d do it. We should have to dine off Boleyn&rsquo;s block:&mdash;coquite
      horum obsonia he&rsquo;d say, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jennings espied my father&rsquo;s carriage, and stepped to speak a word to the
      footman. He returned, saying, with a puff of his cheeks: &lsquo;The Grand
      Monarque has been sending his state equipage to give the old backbiting
      cripple Brisby an airing. He is for horse exercise to-day they&rsquo;ve dropped
      him in Courtenay Square. There goes Brisby. He&rsquo;d take the good Samaritan&rsquo;s
      shilling to buy a flask of poison for him. He &lsquo;ll use Roy&rsquo;s carriage to
      fetch and carry for that venomous old woman Kane, I&rsquo;ll swear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a male in Scripture,&rsquo; said Wedderburn, and this reminded me of an
      anecdote that reminded him of another, and after telling them, he handed
      round his hat for the laugh, as my father would have phrased it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has her ladyship declared war?&rsquo; Sir Weeton Slater inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, that&rsquo;s not her preliminary to wageing it,&rsquo; Wedderburn replied. These
      high-pressure smart talkers had a moment of dulness, and he bethought him
      that he must run into the Club for letters, and was busy at Westminster,
      where, if anything fresh occurred between meridian and six o&rsquo;clock, he
      should be glad, he said, to have word of it by messenger, that he might
      not be behind his Age.

    <p>
      The form of humour to express the speed of the world was common, but it
      struck me as a terrible illustration of my father&rsquo;s. I had still a sense
      of pleasure in the thought that these intimates of his were gentlemen who
      relished and, perhaps, really liked him. They were not parasites; not the
      kind of men found hanging about vulgar profligates.
    </p>
    <p>
      I quitted them. Sir Weeton Slater walked half-a-dozen steps beside me.
      &lsquo;May I presume on a friendly acquaintance with your father, Mr. Richmond?&rsquo; 
      he said. &lsquo;The fact is&mdash;you will not be offended?&mdash;he is apt to
      lose his head, unless the Committee of Supply limits him very precisely. I
      am aware that there is no material necessity for any restriction.&rsquo; He
      nodded to me as to one of the marvellously endowed, as who should say, the
      Gods presided at your birth. The worthy baronet struggled to impart his
      meaning, which was, that he would have me define something like an
      allowance to my father, not so much for the purpose of curtailing his
      expenditure&mdash;he did not venture upon private ground&mdash;as to
      bridle my father&rsquo;s ideas of things possible for a private gentleman in
      this country. In that character none were like him. As to his suit, or
      appeal, he could assure me that Serjeant Wedderburn, and all who would or
      could speak on the subject, saw no prospect of success; not any. The worst
      of it was, that it caused my father to commit himself in sundry ways. It
      gave a handle to his enemies. It&mdash;he glanced at me indicatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thanked the well-meaning gentleman without encouraging him to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It led him to perform once more as a Statue of Bronze before the whole of
      gaping London!&rsquo; I could have added. That scene on the pine-promontory
      arose in my vision, followed by other scenes of the happy German days. I
      had no power to conjure up the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jorian DeWitt was the man I wanted to see. After applications at his Club
      and lodgings I found him dragging his Burgundy leg in the Park, on his
      road to pay a morning visit to his fair French enchantress. I impeached
      him, and he pleaded guilty, clearly not wishing to take me with him, nor
      would he give me Mlle. Jenny&rsquo;s address, which I had. By virtue of the
      threat that I would accompany him if he did not satisfy me, I managed to
      extract the story of the Dauphin, aghast at the discovery of its being
      true. The fatal after-dinner speech he believed to have been actually
      spoken, and he touched on that first. &lsquo;A trap was laid for him, Harry
      Richmond; and a deuced clever trap it was. They smuggled in special
      reporters. There wasn&rsquo;t a bit of necessity for the toast. But the old
      vixen has shown her hand, so now he must fight. He can beat her
      single-handed on settees. He&rsquo;ll find her a tartar at long bowls: she
      sticks at nothing. She blazes out, that he scandalizes her family. She has
      a dozen indictments against him. You must stop in town and keep watch.
      There&rsquo;s fire in my leg to explode a powder-magazine a mile off!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it the Margravine of Rippau?&rsquo; I inquired. I could think of no other
      waspish old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lady Dane,&rsquo; said Jorian. &lsquo;She set Edbury on to face him with the Dauphin.
      You don&rsquo;t fancy it came of the young dog &ldquo;all of himself,&rdquo; do you? Why, it
      was clever! He trots about a briefless little barrister, a scribbler,
      devilish clever and impudent, who does his farces for him. Tenby &lsquo;s the
      fellow&rsquo;s name, and it&rsquo;s the only thing I haven&rsquo;t heard him pun on. Puns
      are the smallpox of the language;&mdash;we&rsquo;re cursed with an epidemic. By
      gad, the next time I meet him I &lsquo;ll roar out for vaccine matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He described the dinner given by Edbury at a celebrated City tavern where
      my father and this so-called Dauphin were brought together. &lsquo;Dinner
      to-night,&rsquo; he nodded, as he limped away on his blissful visit of ceremony
      to sprightly Chassediane (a bouquet had gone in advance): he left me
      stupefied. The sense of ridicule enveloped me in suffocating folds,
      howling sentences of the squire&rsquo;s Boeotian burlesque by fits. I felt that
      I could not but take the world&rsquo;s part against the man who allowed himself
      to be made preposterous externally, when I knew him to be staking his
      frail chances and my fortune with such rashness. It was unpardonable for
      one in his position to incur ridicule. Nothing but a sense of duty kept me
      from rushing out of London, and I might have indulged the impulse
      advantageously. Delay threw me into the clutches of Lady Kane herself, on
      whom I looked with as composed a visage as I could command, while she
      leaned out of her carriage chattering at me, and sometimes over my head to
      passing gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wanted me to take a seat beside her, she had so much to say. Was there
      not some funny story abroad of a Pretender to the Throne of France? she
      asked, wrinkling her crow&rsquo;sfeet eyelids to peer at me, and wished to have
      the particulars. I had none to offer. &lsquo;Ah! well,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;you stay in
      London? Come and see me. I&rsquo;m sure you &lsquo;re sensible. You and I can put our
      heads together. He&rsquo;s too often in Courtenay Square, and he&rsquo;s ten years too
      young for that, still. He ought to have good advice. Tell me, how can a
      woman who can&rsquo;t guide herself help a man?&mdash;and the most difficult man
      alive! I&rsquo;m sure you understand me. I can&rsquo;t drive out in the afternoon for
      them. They make a crush here, and a clatter of tongues! ... That&rsquo;s my
      private grievance. But he&rsquo;s now keeping persons away who have the first
      social claim... I know they can&rsquo;t appear. Don&rsquo;t look confused; no one
      accuses you. Only I do say it &lsquo;s getting terribly hot in London for
      somebody. Call on me. Will you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She named her hours. I bowed as soon as I perceived my opportunity. Her
      allusions were to Lady Edbury, and to imputed usurpations of my father&rsquo;s.
      I walked down to the Chambers where Temple was reading Law, for a refuge
      from these annoyances. I was in love with the modest shadowed life Temple
      lived, diligently reading, and glancing on the world as through a dusky
      window, happy to let it run its course while he sharpened his weapons. A
      look at Temple&rsquo;s face told me he had heard quite as much as was known in
      the West. Dining-halls of lawyers are not Cistercian; he was able to give
      me three distinct versions of the story of the Dauphin. No one could be
      friendlier. Indeed Temple now urged me forcibly to prevent my father from
      spending money and wearing his heart out in vain, by stopping the case in
      Dettermain and Newson&rsquo;s hands. They were respectable lawyers, he said, in
      a lawyer&rsquo;s ordinary tone when including such of his species as are not
      black sheep. He thought it possible that my father&rsquo;s personal influence
      overbore their judgment. In fact, nothing bound them to refuse to work for
      him, and he believed that they had submitted their views for his
      consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do wish he&rsquo;d throw it up,&rsquo; Temple exclaimed. &lsquo;It makes him enemies. And
      just examining it, you see he could get no earthly good out of it: he
      might as well try to scale a perpendicular rock. But when I&rsquo;m with him,
      I&rsquo;m ready to fancy what he pleases&mdash;I acknowledge that. He has excess
      of phosphorus, or he&rsquo;s ultra-electrical; doctors could tell us better than
      lawyers.&rsquo; Temple spoke of the clever young barrister Tenby as the man whom
      his father had heard laughing over the trick played upon &lsquo;Roy Richmond.&rsquo; I
      conceived that I might furnish Mr. Tenby a livelier kind of amusement, and
      the thought that I had once been sur le terrain, and had bitterly
      regretted it, by no means deterred me from the idea of a second
      expedition, so black was my mood. A review of the circumstances, aided by
      what reached my ears before the night went over, convinced me that Edbury
      was my man. His subordinate helped him to the instrument, and possibly to
      the plot, but Edbury was the capital offender.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene of the prank was not in itself so bad as the stuff which a
      cunning anecdotist could make out of it. Edbury invited my father to a
      dinner at a celebrated City tavern. He kept his guests (Jennings, Jorian
      DeWitt, Alton, Wedderburn, were among the few I was acquainted with who
      were present) awaiting the arrival of a person for whom he professed
      extraordinary respect. The Dauphin of France was announced. A mild,
      flabby, amiable-looking old person, with shelving forehead and grey locks&mdash;excellently
      built for the object, Jorian said&mdash;entered. The Capet head and
      embonpoint were there. As far as a personal resemblance might go, his
      pretensions to be the long-lost Dauphin were grotesquely convincing, for,
      notwithstanding the accurate picture of the Family presented by him, the
      man was a pattern bourgeois:&mdash;a sturdy impostor, one would have
      thought, and I thought so when I heard of him; but I have been assured
      that he had actually grown old in the delusion that he, carrying on his
      business in the City of London, was the identical Dauphin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edbury played his part by leading his poor old victim half way to meet his
      other most honoured guest, hesitating then and craving counsel whether he
      was right in etiquette to advance the Dauphin so far. The Dauphin left him
      mildly to decide the point: he was eminently mild throughout, and seems to
      have thought himself in good faith surrounded by believers and adherents.
      Edbury&rsquo;s task soon grew too delicate for that coarse boy. In my father&rsquo;s
      dexterous hands he at once lost his assumption of the gallantry of manner
      which could alone help him to retain his advantage. When the wine was in
      him he began to bawl. I could imagine the sort of dialogue he raised. Bets
      on the Dauphin, bets on Roy: they were matched as on a racecourse. The
      Dauphin remembered incidents of his residence in the Temple, with a
      beautiful juvenile faintness: a conscientious angling for recollection,
      Wedderburn said. Roy was requested to remember something, to drink and
      refresh his memory infantine incidents were suggested. He fenced the
      treacherous host during dinner with superb complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dauphin was of an immoveable composure. He &lsquo;stated simple facts: he
      was the Dauphin of France, providentially rescued from the Temple in the
      days of the Terror.&rsquo; For this deliverance, somewhat to the consternation
      of the others, he offered up a short prayer of thanksgiving over his
      plate. He had, he said, encountered incredulity. He had his proofs. He who
      had never been on the soil of France since early boyhood, spoke French
      with a pure accent: he had the physical and moral constitution of the
      Family: owing to events attending his infant days, he was timid. Jorian
      imitated him:&mdash;&lsquo;I start at the opening of a door; I see dark faces in
      my sleep: it is a dungeon; I am at the knees of my Unfortunate Royal
      Father, with my Beautiful Mother.&rsquo; His French was quaint, but not absurd.
      He became loquacious, apostrophizing vacancy with uplifted hand and eye.
      The unwonted invitation to the society of noblemen made him conceive his
      Dauphinship to be on the high road to a recognition in England, and he was
      persuaded to drink and exhibit proofs: which were that he had the
      constitution of the Family, as aforesaid, in every particular; that he was
      peculiarly marked with testificatory spots; and that his mere aspect
      inspired all members and branch members of the Family with awe and
      stupefaction. One of the latter hearing of him, had appointed to meet him
      in a pastrycook&rsquo;s shop. He met him, and left the place with a cloud on his
      brow, showing tokens of respectful sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conceive a monomaniacal obese old English citizen, given to lift hand and
      eye and address the cornices, claiming to be an Illustrious Boy, and
      calling on a beautiful historic mother and unfortunate Royal sire to
      attest it! No wonder the table was shaken with laughter. He appealed to
      Tenby constantly, as to the one man he knew in the room. Tenby it was who
      made the discovery of him somewhere in the City, where he earned his
      livelihood either as a corn-merchant; or a stockbroker, or a
      chronometer-maker, or a drysalter, and was always willing to gratify a
      customer with the sight of his proofs of identity. Mr. Tenby made it his
      business to push his clamorous waggishness for the exhibition. I could
      readily believe that my father was more than his match in disposable
      sallies and weight of humour, and that he shielded the old creature
      successfully, so long as he had a tractable being to protect. But the
      Dauphin was plied with wine, and the marquis had his fun. Proof upon proof
      in verification of his claims was proffered by the now-tremulous son of
      St. Louis&mdash;so he called himself. With, Jorian admitted, a real
      courtly dignity, he stood up and proposed to lead the way to any
      neighbouring cabinet to show the spots on his person; living witnesses to
      the truth of his allegations, he declared them to be. The squire had
      authority for his broad farce, except in so far as he mixed up my father
      in the swinery of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew more and more convinced that my father never could have lost his
      presence of mind when he found himself in the net of a plot to cover him
      with ridicule. He was the only one who did not retire to the Dauphin&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;chamber of testification,&rsquo; to return convulsed with vinous laughter after
      gravely inspecting the evidence; for which abstention the Dauphin
      reproached him violently, in round terms of abuse, challengeing him to go
      through a similar process. This was the signal for Edbury, Tenby, and some
      of the rest. They formed a circle, one-half for the Dauphin, one for Roy.
      How long the boorish fun lasted, and what exactly came of it, I did not
      hear. Jorian DeWitt said my father lost his temper, a point contested by
      Wedderburn and Jennings, for it was unknown of him. Anyhow, he thundered
      to some effect, inasmuch as he detached those that had gentlemanly
      feelings from the wanton roysterers, and next day the latter pleaded wine.
      But they told the story, not without embellishments. The world followed
      their example.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dined and slept at Temple&rsquo;s house, not caring to meet my incarnate
      humiliation. I sent to hear that he was safe. A quiet evening with a
      scholarly man, and a man of strong practical ability and shrewdness, like
      Mr. Temple, did me good. I wished my father and I were on the same footing
      as he and his son, and I may add his daughters. They all talked sensibly;
      they were at feud with nobody; they reflected their condition. It was a
      simple orderly English household, of which the father was the pillar, the
      girls the ornaments, the son the hope, growing to take his father&rsquo;s place.
      My envy of such a home was acute, and I thought of Janet, and how well she
      was fashioned to build one resembling it, if only the mate allotted to her
      should not be a fantastical dreamer. Temple&rsquo;s character seemed to me to
      demand a wife like Janet on its merits; an idea that depressed me
      exceedingly. I had introduced Temple to Anna Penrhys, who was very kind to
      him; but these two were not framed to be other than friends. Janet, on the
      contrary, might some day perceive the sterling fellow Temple was,
      notwithstanding his moderate height. She might, I thought. I remembered
      that I had once wished that she would, and I was amazed at myself. But
      why? She was a girl sure to marry. I brushed these meditations away. They
      recurred all the time I was in Temple&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Temple waited for my invitation to touch on my father&rsquo;s Case, when he
      distinctly pronounced his opinion that it could end but in failure. Though
      a strict Constitutionalist, he had words of disgust for princes,
      acknowledging, however, that we were not practical in our use of them, and
      kept them for political purposes often to the perversion of our social
      laws and their natural dispositions. He spoke of his son&rsquo;s freak in
      joining the Navy. &lsquo;That was the princess&rsquo;s doing,&rsquo; said Temple. &lsquo;She
      talked of our naval heroes, till she made me feel I had only to wear the
      anchor buttons to be one myself. Don&rsquo;t tell her I was invalided from the
      service, Richie, for the truth is, I believe, I half-shammed. And the time
      won&rsquo;t be lost. You&rsquo;ll see I shall extract guineas from &ldquo;old ocean&rdquo; like
      salt. Precious few barristers understand maritime cases. The other day I
      was in Court, and prompted a great Q.C. in a case of collision. Didn&rsquo;t I,
      sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think there was a hoarse whisper audible up to the Judge&rsquo;s seat at
      intervals,&rsquo; said Mr. Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Bar cannot confess to obligations from those who don&rsquo;t wear the
      robe,&rsquo; Temple rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father advised me to read for the Bar, as a piece of very good
      training.
    </p>
    <p>
      I appealed to Temple, whether he thought it possible to read law-books in
      a cockboat in a gale of wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple grimaced and his father nodded. Still it struck me that I might one
      day have the felicity of quiet hours to sit down with Temple and read Law&mdash;far
      behind him in the race. And he envied me, in his friendly manner, I knew.
      My ambition had been blown to tatters.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new day dawned. The household rose and met at the breakfast-table,
      devoid of any dread of the morning newspapers. Their talk was like the
      chirrup of birds. Temple and his father walked away together to chambers,
      bent upon actual business&mdash;upon doing something! I reflected
      emphatically, and compared them to ships with rudders, while I was at the
      mercy of wind, tide, and wave. I called at Dettermain and Newson&rsquo;s, and
      heard there of a discovery of a witness essential to the case, either in
      North Wales or in New South. I did not, as I had intended, put a veto on
      their proceedings. The thing to do was to see my father, and cut the case
      at the fountain head. For this purpose, it was imperative that I should go
      to him, and prepare myself for the interview by looking at the newspapers
      first. I bought one, hastily running my eyes down the columns in the shop.
      His name was printed, but merely in a fashionable notification that
      carriages took up and set down for his costume Ball, according to certain
      regulations. The relief of comparative obscurity helped me to breathe
      freely: not to be laughed at, was a gain. I was rather inclined to laud
      his courage in entering assembly-rooms, where he must be aware that he
      would see the Dauphin on every face. Perhaps he was guilty of some new
      extravagance last night, too late for scandal to reinforce the reporters!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Waddy had a woeful visage when informing me that he was out, gone to
      Courtenay Square. She ventured a murmur of bills coming in. Like everybody
      else, she fancied he drew his supplies from my inexhaustible purse; she
      hoped the bills would be paid off immediately: the servants&rsquo; wages were
      overdue. &lsquo;Never can I get him to attend to small accounts,&rsquo; she whimpered,
      and was so ready to cry outright, that I said, &lsquo;Tusk,&rsquo; and with the one
      word gave her comfort. &lsquo;Of course, you, Mr. Harry, can settle them, I know
      that.&rsquo; We were drawing near to poor old Sewis&rsquo;s legacy, even for the
      settling of the small accounts!
    </p>
    <p>
      London is a narrow place to one not caring to be seen. I could not remain
      in this creditor-riddled house; I shunned the Parks, the Clubs, and the
      broad, brighter streets of the West. Musing on the refreshing change it
      would be to me to find myself suddenly on board Captain Jasper Welsh&rsquo;s
      barque Priscilla, borne away to strange climes and tongues, the world
      before me, I put on the striding pace which does not invite interruption,
      and no one but Edbury would have taken the liberty. I heard his shout.
      &lsquo;Halloa! Richmond.&rsquo; He was driving his friend Witlington in his cabriolet.
      &lsquo;Richmond, my hearty, where the deuce have you been? I wanted you to dine
      with me the other night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I replied, looking at him steadily, that I wished I had been there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Compendious larks!&rsquo; cried he, in the slang of his dog&rsquo;s day. &lsquo;I say;
      you&rsquo;re one at Duke Fitz&rsquo;s masquerade to-night? Tell us your toggery. Hang
      it, you might go for the Black Prince. I&rsquo;m Prince Hal. Got a headache?
      Come to my Club and try my mixture. Yoicks! it&rsquo;d make Methuselah and
      Melchisedec jump up and have a twirl and a fandango. I say, you&rsquo;re thick
      with that little French actress Chastedian jolly little woman! too much to
      say for herself to suit me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He described the style of woman that delighted him&mdash;an ideal English
      shepherdess of the print-shops, it appeared, and of extremely remote
      interest to me, I thought at the time. Eventually I appointed to walk
      round to his Club, and he touched his horse gently, and bobbed his
      diminutive henchman behind his smart cabriolet, the admiration of the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found him waiting for me on the steps of his Club, puffing a cigar with
      all his vigour, in the classic attitude of a trumpeter. My first words
      were: &lsquo;I think I have to accuse you of insulting me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Insulting you, Richmond!&rsquo; he cried, much surprised, holding his cigar in
      transit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you insult my father, I make you responsible to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Insult old Duke Fitz! I give you my word of honour, Richmond&mdash;why, I
      like him; I like the old boy. Wouldn&rsquo;t hurt him for the world and all
      Havannah.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the deuce have you got into your head? Come in and smoke.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The mention of his dinner and the Dauphin crazed him with laughter. He
      begged me as a man to imagine the scene: the old Bloated Bourbon of London
      Wall and Camberwell! an Illustrious Boy!&mdash;drank like a fish!&mdash;ready
      to show himself to the waiters! And then with &lsquo;Gee&rsquo; and &lsquo;Gaw,&rsquo; the marquis
      spouted out reminiscences of scene, the best ever witnessed! &lsquo;Up starts
      the Dauphin. &ldquo;Damn you, sir! and damn me, sir, if believe you have a spot
      on your whole body!&rdquo; And snuffles and puffs&mdash;you should have been
      there Richmond, I wrote to ask you: did, upon my life! wanted you there.
      Lord! why, you won&rsquo;t get such fun in a century. And old Roy! he behaved
      uncommonly finely: said capital things, by Jove! Never saw him shine so;
      old trump! Says Dauphin, &ldquo;My beautiful mother had a longing for
      strawberries out of season. I am marked with a strawberry, here.&rdquo; Says
      Roy: &ldquo;It is an admirable and roomy site, but as I am not your enemy, sir,
      I doubt if I shall often have the opportunity to behold it.&rdquo; Ha! ha!&mdash;gee!
      Richmond, you&rsquo;ve missed the deucedest good scene ever acted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      How could I, after having had an adversary like Prince Otto, call upon a
      fellow such as Edbury to give me reason for his conduct? He rollicked and
      laughed until my ungovernable impatience brought him to his senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dash it, you&rsquo;re a fire-eater, I know, Richmond. We can&rsquo;t fight in this
      country; ain&rsquo;t allowed. And fighting &lsquo;s infernal folly. By Jove! If you&rsquo;re
      going to tumble down every man who enjoys old Roy, you&rsquo;ve your work cut
      out for you. He&rsquo;s long chalks the best joke out. &lsquo;Twixt you and me, he did
      return thanks. What does it matter what old Duke Fitz does? I give him a
      lift on his ladder with all my heart. He keeps a capital table. And I&rsquo;ll
      be hanged if he hasn&rsquo;t got the secret of the women. How he does it old
      Roy! If the lords were ladies they&rsquo;d vote him premier peer, double quick.
      And I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Richmond, I&rsquo;m thought a devil of a good-tempered
      fellow for not keeping watch over Courtenay Square. I don&rsquo;t call it my
      business to be house dog for a pretty stepmother. But there&rsquo;s talking and
      nodding, and oh! leave all that: come in and smoke, and let me set you up;
      and I&rsquo;ll shake your hand. Halloa! I&rsquo;m hailed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A lady, grasping the veil across her face, beckoned her hand from a closed
      carriage below. Edbury ran down to her. I caught sight of ravishing golden
      locks, reminding me of Mabel Sweetwinter&rsquo;s hair, and pricking me with a
      sensation of spite at the sex for their deplorable madness in the choice
      of favourites. Edbury called me to come to the carriage window. I moved
      slowly, but the carriage wheeled about and rolled away. I could just see
      the outline of a head muffled in furs and lace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Queer fish, women!&rsquo; he delivered himself of the philosophical ejaculation
      cloudily. I was not on terms with him to offer any remark upon the one in
      question. His imperturbable good humour foiled me, and I left him, merely
      giving him a warning, to which his answer was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! come in and have a bottle of claret.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Claret or brandy had done its work on him by the time I encountered him
      some hours later, in the Park. Bramham DeWitt, whom I met in the same
      neighbourhood, offered me a mount after lunch, advising me to keep near my
      father as much as I conveniently could; and he being sure to appear in the
      Park, I went, and heard his name to the right and left of me. He was now,
      as he said to me once that he should become, &lsquo;the tongue of London.&rsquo; I
      could hardly expect to escape from curious scrutiny myself; I was looked
      at. Here and there I had to lift my hat and bow. The stultification of
      one&rsquo;s feelings and ideas in circumstances which divide and set them at
      variance is worse than positive pain. The looks shed on me were rather
      flattering, but I knew that in the background I was felt to be the son of
      the notorious. Edbury came trotting up to us like a shaken sack, calling,
      &lsquo;Neigh! any of you seen old Roy?&rsquo; Bramham DeWitt, a stiff, fashionable man
      of fifty, proud of his blood and quick as his cousin Jorian to resent an
      impertinence, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you the Marquis of Edbury, or a drunken groom, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gad, old gentleman, I&rsquo;ve half a mind to ride you down,&rsquo; said Edbury, and,
      espying me, challenged me to a race to run down the fogies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cavalcade of six abreast came cantering along. I saw my father listen to
      a word from Lady Edbury, and push his horse to intercept the marquis. They
      spoke. &lsquo;Presently, presently,&rsquo; my father said; &lsquo;ride to the rear, and keep
      at half a stone&rsquo;s throw-say, a groom&rsquo;s distance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Groom be hanged!&rsquo; Edbury retorted. &lsquo;I made a bet I&rsquo;d drive you out of the
      Park, old Roy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ride behind, then,&rsquo; said my father, and to my astonishment Edbury obeyed
      him, with laughter. Lady Edbury smiled to herself; and I experienced the
      esteem I perceived in her for a masterful manner. A few minutes later my
      father beckoned me to pay my respects to Graf Kesensky, an ambassador with
      strong English predilections and some influence among us. He asked me if
      he was right in supposing I wished to enter Parliament. I said he was,
      wondering at the interest a foreigner could find in it. The count stopped
      a quiet-pacing gentleman. Bramhaxri DeWitt joined them, and a group of
      friends. I was introduced to Mr. Beauchamp Hill, the Government whip, who
      begged me to call on him with reference to the candidature of a Sussex
      borough: &lsquo;that is,&rsquo; said he, turning to Graf Kesensky, &lsquo;if you&rsquo;re sure the
      place is open? I&rsquo;ve heard nothing of Falmouth&rsquo;s accident.&rsquo; The count
      replied that Falmouth was his intimate friend; he had received a special
      report that Falmouth was dying, just as he was on the point of mounting
      his horse. &lsquo;We shan&rsquo;t have lost time,&rsquo; said Mr. Hill. The Government
      wanted votes. I went down to the House of Commons at midnight to see him.
      He had then heard of Falmouth&rsquo;s hopeless condition, and after extracting
      my political views, which were for the nonce those of a happy
      subserviency, he expressed his belief that the new writ for the borough of
      Chippenden might be out, and myself seated on the Government benches,
      within a very short period. Nor would it be necessary, he thought, for the
      Government nominee to spend money: &lsquo;though that does not affect you, Mr.
      Richmond!&rsquo; My supposed wealth gave me currency even in political circles.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII. I BECOME ONE OF THE CHOSEN OF THE NATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      An entire revulsion in my feelings and my way of thinking was caused by
      this sudden change of prospect. A member of our Parliament, I could then
      write to Ottilia, and tell her that I had not wasted time. And it was due
      to my father, I confessed, when he returned from his ball at dawn, that I
      should thank him for speaking to Graf Kesensky. &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that was
      our luck, Richie. I have been speaking about you to hundreds for the last
      six months, and now we owe it to a foreigner!&rsquo; I thanked him again. He
      looked eminently handsome in his Henry III. costume, and was disposed to
      be as luxurious as his original. He had brought Count Lika, Secretary of
      Legation to the Austrian Embassy, dressed as an Albanian, with him. The
      two were stretched on couches, and discoursing of my father&rsquo;s
      reintroduction of the sedan chair to society. My father explained that he
      had ordered a couple of dozen of these chairs to be built on a pattern of
      his own. And he added, &lsquo;By the way, Richie, there will be sedaniers&mdash;porters
      to pay to-day. Poor men should be paid immediately.&rsquo; I agreed with the
      monarch. Contemplating him, I became insensible to the sting of ridicule
      which had been shooting through me, agonizing me for the last
      eight-and-forty hours. Still I thought: can I never escape from the
      fascination?&mdash;let me only get into Parliament! The idea in me was
      that Parliament lifted me nearer to Ottilia, and would prompt me to
      resolute action, out of his tangle of glittering cobwebs. I told him of my
      interview with Beauchamp Hill. &lsquo;I have never known Kesensky wrong yet,&rsquo; 
      said he; &lsquo;except in his backing of Falmouth&rsquo;s horses.&rsquo; Count Lika murmured
      that he hoped his Chief would be wrong in something else: he spoke
      significantly. My father raised his eyebrows. &lsquo;In his opinion,&rsquo; Lika
      accepted the invitation to pursue, &lsquo;Prince Ernest will not let that
      announcement stand uncontradicted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father&rsquo;s eyes dwelt on him. &lsquo;Are we accused of it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lika slipped from the question. &lsquo;Who is accused of a newspaper&rsquo;s doings?
      It is but the denial of a statement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare them to deny it!&mdash;and, Lika, my dear fellow, light me a
      cigarette,&rsquo; said my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said Lika, touching the flame delicately, &lsquo;you take the view that
      Kesensky is wrong in another thing besides horses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe he struck on the subject casually: there was nothing for him to
      gain or lose in it; and he had a liking for my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      After puffing the cigarette twice or thrice my father threw it down,
      resuming his conversation upon the sedan, the appropriate dresses of
      certain of the great masquerading ladies, and an incident that appeared to
      charge Jorian DeWitt with having misconducted himself. The moment Lika had
      gone upstairs for two or three hours&rsquo; sleep, he said to me: &lsquo;Richie, you
      and I have no time for that. We must have a man at Falmouth&rsquo;s house by
      eight o&rsquo;clock. If the scrubbing-maid on all fours-not an inelegant
      position, I have remarked&mdash;declares him dead, we are at Bartlett&rsquo;s
      (money-lender) by ten: and in Chippenden borough before two post meridian.
      As I am a tactician, there is mischief! but I will turn it to my uses, as
      I did our poor Jorian to-night; he smuggled in the Chassediane: I led her
      out on my arm. Of that by and by. The point is, that from your oath in
      Parliament you fly to Sarkeld. I implore you now, by your love for me and
      the princess, not to lose precious minutes. Richie, we will press things
      so that you shall be in Sarkeld by the end of the month. My son! my dear
      boy! how you loved me once!&mdash;you do still! then follow my directions.
      I have a head. Ay, you think it wild? &lsquo;Tis true, my mother was a poetess.
      But I will convince my son as I am convincing the world-tut, tut! To avoid
      swelling talk, I tell you, Richie, I have my hand on the world&rsquo;s wheel,
      and now is the time for you to spring from it and gain your altitude. If
      you fail, my success is emptiness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you avoid Edbury and his like, and protect yourself?&rsquo; was my form of
      stipulation, spoken to counteract his urgency.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave no answer beyond a wave of the hand suitable to his princely
      one-coloured costume of ruffled lavender silk, and the magnificent leg he
      turned to front me. My senses even up to that period were so
      impressionable as to be swayed by a rich dress and a grand manner when
      circumstances were not too unfavourable. Now they seemed very favourable,
      for they offered me an upward path to tread. His appearance propitiated me
      less after he had passed through the hands of his man Tollingby, but I had
      again surrendered the lead to him. As to the risk of proceedings being
      taken against him, he laughed scornfully at the suggestion. &lsquo;They dare
      not. The more I dare, the less dare they.&rsquo; Again I listened to his curious
      roundabout reasoning, which dragged humour at its heels like a comical
      cur, proclaiming itself imposingly, in spite of the mongrel&rsquo;s barking, to
      be prudence and common sense. Could I deny that I owed him gratitude for
      the things I cherished most?&mdash;for my acquaintance with Ottilia?&mdash;for
      his services in Germany?&mdash;for the prospect of my elevation in
      England? I could not; and I tried hard to be recklessly grateful. As to
      money, he reiterated that he could put his hand on it to satisfy the
      squire on the day of accounts: for the present, we must borrow. His
      argument upon borrowing&mdash;which I knew well, and wondered that I did
      not at the outset disperse with a breath of contempt&mdash;gained on me
      singularly when reviewed under the light of my immediate interests: it ran
      thus:&mdash;We have a rich or a barren future, just as we conceive it. The
      art of generalship in life consists in gathering your scattered supplies
      to suit a momentous occasion; and it is the future which is chiefly in
      debt to us, and adjures us for its sake to fight the fight and conquer.
      That man is vile and fit to be trampled on who cannot count his future in
      gold and victory. If, as we find, we are always in debt to the past, we
      should determine that the future is in our debt, and draw on it. Why let
      our future lie idle while we need succour? For instance, to-morrow I am to
      have what saves my reputation in the battle to-day; shall I not take it at
      once? The military commander who acts on that principle overcomes his
      adversary to a certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You, Richie, the member for this borough of Chippenden, have won solid
      ground. I guarantee it to you. And you go straight from the hustings, or
      the first taste of parliamentary benches, to Sarkeld: you take your
      grandad&rsquo;s proposition to Prince Ernest: you bring back the prince&rsquo;s
      acceptance to the squire. Can you hope to have a princess without a battle
      for her?&rsquo; More and much more in this strain, until&mdash;for he could read
      me and most human beings swiftly on the surface, notwithstanding the
      pressure of his fancifulness&mdash;he perceived that talking influenced me
      far less than activity, and so after a hurried breakfast and an innocuous
      glance at the damp morning papers, we started to the money-lender&rsquo;s, with
      Jennings to lend his name. We were in Chippenden close upon the hour my
      father had named, bringing to the startled electors the first news of
      their member&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the heat of the canvass for votes I received a kind letter from the
      squire in reply to one of mine, wherein he congratulated me on my
      prospects of success, and wound up: &lsquo;Glad to see it announced you are off
      with that princess of yours. Show them we are as proud as they are, Harry,
      and a fig for the whole foreign lot! Come to Riversley soon, and be
      happy.&rsquo; What did that mean? Heriot likewise said in a letter: &lsquo;So it&rsquo;s
      over? The proud prince kicks? You will not thank me for telling you now
      what you know I think about it.&rsquo; I appealed to my father. &lsquo;Canvass!
      canvass!&rsquo; cried he; and he persistently baffled me. It was from Temple I
      learnt that on the day of our starting for Chippenden, the newspapers
      contained a paragraph in large print flatly denying upon authority that
      there was any foundation for the report of an intended marriage between
      the Princess of Eppenwelzen-Sarkeld and an English gentleman. Then I
      remembered how that morning my father had flung the papers down,
      complaining of their dampness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would such denial have appeared without Ottilia&rsquo;s sanction?
    </p>
    <p>
      My father proved that I was harnessed to him; there was no stopping, no
      time for grieving. Pace was his specific. He dragged me the round of the
      voters; he gave dinners at the inn of true Liberals, and ate of them
      contentedly; he delivered speeches incessantly. The whole force of his.
      serio-comic genius was alive in its element at Chippenden. From balls and
      dinners, and a sharp contest to maintain his position in town, he was down
      among us by the first morning train, bright as Apollo, and quite the sun
      of the place, dazzling the independent electors and their wives, and even
      me somewhat; amazing me, certainly. Dettermain, his lawyer, who had never
      seen him in action, and supposed he would treat an election as he did his
      Case, with fits and starts of energy, was not less astonished, and tried
      to curb him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Dettermain, my dear sir, I apprehend it is the electoral maxim to woo
      the widowed borough with the tear in its eye, and I shall do so hotly, in
      a right masculine manner,&rsquo; my father said. &lsquo;We have the start; and if we
      beat the enemy by nothing else we will beat him by constitution. We are
      the first in the field, and not to reap it is to acknowledge oneself
      deficient in the very first instrument with which grass was cut.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Our difficulty all through the election was to contend with his humour.
      The many triumphs it won for him, both in speech and in action, turned at
      least the dialectics of the argument against us, and amusing, flattering,
      or bewildering, contributed to silence and hold us passive. Political
      convictions of his own, I think I may say with truth, he had none. He
      would have been just as powerful, after his fashion, on the Tory side,
      pleading for Mr. Normanton Hipperdon; more, perhaps: he would have been
      more in earnest. His store of political axioms was Tory; but he did
      remarkably well, and with no great difficulty, in confuting them to the
      wives of voters, to the voters themselves, and at public assemblies. Our
      adversary was redoubtable; a promising Opposition member, ousted from his
      seat in the North&mdash;a handsome man, too, which my father admitted, and
      wealthy, being junior partner in a City banking firm. Anna Penrhys knew
      him, and treacherously revealed some of the enemy&rsquo;s secrets, notably
      concerning what he termed our incorrigible turn for bribery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that means,&rsquo; my father said, &lsquo;that Mr. Hipperdon does not possess the
      art of talking to the ladies. I shall try him in repartee on the hustings.
      I must contrive to have our Jorian at my elbow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The task of getting Jorian to descend upon such a place as Chippenden
      worried my father more than electoral anxieties. Jorian wrote, &lsquo;My best
      wishes to you. Be careful of your heads. The habit of the Anglo-Saxon is
      to conclude his burlesques with a play of cudgels. It is his notion of
      freedom, and at once the exordium and peroration of his eloquence. Spare
      me the Sussex accent on your return.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father read out the sentences of this letter with admiring bursts of
      indignation at the sarcasms, and an evident idea that I inclined to
      jealousy of the force displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But we must have him,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I do not feel myself complete without
      Jorian.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So he made dispositions for a concert to be given in Chippenden town.
      Jenny Chassediane was invited down to sing, and Jorian came in her wake,
      of course. He came to suffer tortures. She was obliging enough to
      transform me into her weapon of chastisement upon the poor fellow for his
      behaviour to her at the Ball-atrocious, I was bound to confess. On this
      point she hesitated just long enough to imply a doubt whether, under any
      circumstances, the dues of men should be considered before those of her
      sex, and then struck her hands together with enthusiasm for my father, who
      was, she observed&mdash;critical in millinery in the height of her ecstasy&mdash;the
      most majestic, charming, handsome Henri III. imaginable, the pride and
      glory of the assembly, only one degree too rosy at night for the tone of
      the lavender, needing a touch of French hands, and the merest trifle in
      want of compression about the waistband. She related that a certain Prince
      Henri d&rsquo;Angleterre had buzzed at his ear annoyingly. &lsquo;Et Gascoigne, ou
      est-il?&rsquo; called the King, and the Judge stepped forth to correct the
      obstreperous youth. The Judge was Jennings, clearly prepared by my father
      to foil the Prince&mdash;no other than Edbury. It was incomprehensible to
      me that my father should tolerate the tatter&rsquo;s pranks; unless, indeed, he
      borrowed his name to bonds of which I heard nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Chassediane vowed that her own dress was ravishing. She went
      attired as a boudoir-shepherdess or demurely-coquettish Sevres-china
      Ninette, such of whom Louis Quinze would chuck the chin down the deadly
      introductory walks of Versailles. The reason of her desiring to go was the
      fatal sin of curiosity, and, therefore, her sex&rsquo;s burden, not hers. Jorian
      was a Mousquetaire, with plumes and ruffles prodigious, and a hen&rsquo;s heart
      beneath his cock&rsquo;s feathers. &lsquo;Pourtant j&rsquo;y allai. I saw your great ladies,
      how they carry themselves when they would amuse themselves, and, mon Dieu!
      Paris has done its utmost to grace their persons, and the length of their
      robes did the part of Providence in bestowing height upon them, parceque,
      vous savez, Monsieur, c&rsquo;est extraordinaire comme ils ont les jambes
      courtes, ces Anglaises!&rsquo; Our aristocracy, however, was not so bad in that
      respect as our bourgeoisie; yet it was easy to perceive that our female
      aristocracy, though they could ride, had never been drilled to walk: &lsquo;de
      belles femmes, oui; seulement, tenez, je n&rsquo;admire ni les yeux de vache, ni
      de souris, ni mime ceux de verre comme ornement feminin. Avec de
      l&rsquo;embonpoint elles font de l&rsquo;effet, mais maigre il n&rsquo;y a aucune illusion
      possible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This vindictive critic smarted, with cause, at the recollection of her
      walk out of her rooms. Jorian&rsquo;s audacity or infatuation quitted him
      immediately after he had gratified her whim. The stout Mousquetaire placed
      her in a corner, and enveloped her there, declaring that her petition had
      been that she might come to see, not to be seen,&mdash;as if, she cried
      out tearfully, the two wishes must not necessarily exist together, like
      the masculine and the feminine in this world! Prince Hal, acting the most
      profligate period of his career, espied her behind the Mousquetaire&rsquo;s
      moustache, and did not fail to make much of his discovery. In a perilous
      moment for the reputation of the Ball, my father handed him over to
      Gascoigne, and conducted Jenny in a leisurely walk on his arm out of the
      rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Il est comme les Romains,&rsquo; she said: &lsquo;he never despairs of himself. It is
      a Jupiter! If he must punish you he confers a dignity in doing it. Now I
      comprehend, that with such women as these grandes dames Anglaises I should
      have done him harm but for his greatness of soul.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Some harm, I fancied, must have been done, in spite of his boast to the
      contrary. He had to be in London every other night, and there were tales
      current of intrigues against him which had their sources from very lofty
      regions. But in Chippenden he threw off London, just as lightly as in
      London he discarded Chippenden. No symptom of personal discouragement, or
      of fatigue, was betrayed in his face. I spoke once of that paragraph
      purporting to emanate from Prince Ernest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It may,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Business! Richie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He set to counting the promises of votes, disdaining fears and
      reflections. Concerts, cricket-matches, Balls, dinner-parties, and the
      round of the canvass, and speech-making at our gatherings, occupied every
      minute of my time, except on Saturday evenings, when I rode over to
      Riversley with Temple to spend the Sunday. Temple, always willing to play
      second to me, and a trifle melancholy under his partial eclipse-which,
      perhaps, suggested the loss of Janet to him&mdash;would have it that this
      election was one of the realizations of our boyish dreams of greatness.
      The ladies were working rosettes for me. My aunt Dorothy talked very
      anxiously about the day appointed by my father to repay the large sum
      expended. All hung upon that day, she said, speaking from her knowledge of
      the squire. She was moved to an extreme distress by the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is confident, Harry; but where can he obtain the money? If your
      grandfather sees it invested in your name in Government securities, he
      will be satisfied, not otherwise: nothing less will satisfy him; and if
      that is not done, he will join you and your father together in his mind;
      and as he has hitherto treated one he will treat both. I know him. He is
      just, to the extent of his vision; but he will not be able to separate
      you. He is aware that your father has not restricted his expenses since
      they met; he will say you should have used your influence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She insisted on this, until the tears streamed from her eyes, telling me
      that my grandfather was the most upright and unsuspicious of men, and
      precisely on that account the severest when he thought he had been
      deceived. The fair chances of my election did not console her, as it did
      me, by dazzling me. She affirmed strongly that she was sure my father
      expected success at the election to be equivalent to the promised
      restitution of the money, and begged me to warn him that nothing short of
      the sum squandered would be deemed sufficient at Riversley. My dear aunt,
      good woman though she was, seemed to me to be waxing miserly. The squire
      had given her the name of Parsimony; she had vexed him, Janet told me, by
      subscribing a miserable sum to a sailors&rsquo; asylum that he patronized&mdash;a
      sum he was ashamed to see standing as the gift of a Beltham; and she had
      stopped the building of a wing of her village school-house, designed upon
      his plan. Altogether, she was fretful and distressful; she appeared to
      think that I could have kept my father in better order. Riversley was
      hearing new and strange reports of him. But how could I at Chippenden
      thwart his proceedings in London? Besides, he was serving me
      indefatigably.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can easily be imagined what description of banter he had to meet and
      foil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This gentleman is obliging enough to ask me, &ldquo;How about the Royal Arms?&rdquo;
       If in his extreme consideration he means to indicate my Arms, I will
      inform him that they are open to him; he shall find entertainment for man
      and beast; so he is doubly assured of a welcome.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Questioned whether he did not think he was entitled to be rated at the
      value of half-a-crown, he protested that whatever might be the sum of his
      worth, he was pure coin, of which neither party in Chippenden could accuse
      the silver of rubbing off; and he offered forthwith an impromptu apologue
      of a copper penny that passed itself off for a crown-piece, and deceived a
      portion of the country: that was why (with a wave of the arm over the
      Hipperdon faction) it had a certain number of backers; for everybody on
      whom the counterfeit had been foisted, praised it to keep it in the
      currency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, gentlemen, I apprehend that Chippenden is not the pocket-borough for
      Hipperdon coin. Back with him to the Mint! and, with your permission, we
      will confiscate the first syllable of his name, while we consign him to
      oblivion, with a hip, hip, hip, hurrah for Richmond!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The cheers responded thunderingly, and were as loud when he answered a
      &lsquo;How &lsquo;bout the Dauphin?&rsquo; by saying that it was the Tory hotel, of which he
      knew nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A cheer for old Roy!&rsquo; Edbury sang out.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father checked the roar, and turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Marquis of Edbury, come to the front!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Edbury declined to budge, but the fellows round him edged aside to show
      him a mark for my father&rsquo;s finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen, this is the young Marquis of Edbury, a member of the House of
      Lords by right of his birth, born to legislate for you and me. He,
      gentlemen, makes our laws. Examine him, hear him, meditate on him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused cruelly for Edbury to open his mouth. The young lord looked
      confounded, and from that moment behaved becomingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He might have been doing mischief to-morrow,&rsquo; my father said to me, and
      by letting me conceive his adroitness a matter of design, comforted me
      with proofs of intelligent power, and made me feel less the melancholy
      conjunction of a piece of mechanism and a piece of criticism, which I was
      fast growing to be in the contemplation of the agencies leading to honour
      in our land. Edbury whipped his four-in-hand to conduct our voters to the
      poll. We had to pull hard against Tory interest. It was a sharp, dubious,
      hot day&mdash;a day of outcries against undue influence and against
      bribery&mdash;a day of beer and cheers and the insanest of tricks to cheat
      the polling-booth. Old John Thresher of Dipwell, and Farmer Eckerthy drove
      over to Chippenden to afford me aid and countenance, disconcerting me by
      the sight of them, for I associated them with Janet rather than with
      Ottilia, and it was to Ottilia that I should have felt myself rising when
      the figures increased their pace in my favour, and the yeasty mob
      surrounding my father&rsquo;s superb four-horsed chariot responded to his
      orations by proclaiming me victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I congratulate you, Mr. Richmond,&rsquo; Dettermain said. &lsquo;Up to this day I
      have had my fears that we should haul more moonshine than fish in our net.
      Your father has accomplished prodigies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father, with the bloom of success on his face, led me aside soon after
      a safe majority of upwards of seventy had been officially announced. &lsquo;Now,
      Richie,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you are a Member. Now to the squire away! Thank the
      multitude and off, and as quick to Sarkeld as you well can, and tell the
      squire from me that I pardon his suspicions. I have landed you a Member&mdash;that
      will satisfy him. I am willing, tell him... you know me competent to
      direct mines... bailiff of his estates&mdash;whatever he pleases, to
      effect a reconciliation. I must be in London to-night&mdash;I am in the
      thick of the fray there. No matter: go, my son.&rsquo; He embraced me. It was
      not a moment for me to catechize him, though I could see that he was
      utterly deluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between moonlight and morning, riding with Temple and Captain Bulsted on
      either side of me, I drew rein under the red Grange windows, tired, and in
      love with its air of sleepy grandeur. Janet&rsquo;s window was open. I hailed
      her. &lsquo;Has he won?&rsquo; she sang out in the dark of her room, as though the cry
      of delight came upon the leap from bed. She was dressed. She had
      commissioned Farmer Eckerthy to bring her the news at any hour of the
      night. Seeing me, she clapped hands. &lsquo;Harry, I congratulate you a thousand
      times.&rsquo; She had wit to guess that I should never have thought of coming
      had I not been the winner. I could just discern the curve and roll of her
      famed thick brown hair in the happy shrug of her shoulder, and imagined
      the full stream of it as she leaned out of window to talk to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet herself, unfastened the hall-door bolts. She caressed the horses,
      feverishly exulting, with charming subdued laughter of victory and
      welcome, and amused us by leading my horse round to stables, and whistling
      for one of the lads, playing what may, now and then, be a pretty feature
      in a young woman of character&mdash;the fair tom-boy girl. She and her
      maid prepared coffee and toast for us, and entered the hall, one after the
      other, laden with dishes of cold meat; and not until the captain had eaten
      well did she tell him slyly that somebody, whom she had brought to
      Riversley yesterday, was abed and asleep upstairs. The slyness and its
      sisterly innocence lit up our eyes, and our hearts laughed. Her cheeks
      were deliciously overcoloured. We stole I know not what from the night and
      the day, and conventional circumstances, and rallied Captain Bulsted, and
      behaved as decorous people who treat the night properly, and live by rule,
      do not quite do. Never since Janet was a girl had I seen her so spirited
      and responsive: the womanly armour of half-reserve was put away. We
      chatted with a fresh-hearted natural young creature who forfeited not a
      particle of her ladyship while she made herself our comrade in talk and
      frolic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet and I walked part of the way to the station with Temple, who had to
      catch an early train, and returning&mdash;the song of skylarks covering us&mdash;joined
      hands, having our choice between nothing to say, and the excess; perilous
      both.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIV. MY FATHER IS MIRACULOUSLY RELIEVED BY FORTUNE
    </h2>
    <p>
      My grandfather had a gratification in my success, mingled with a
      transparent jealousy of the chief agent in procuring it. He warned me when
      I left him that he was not to be hoodwinked: he must see the money
      standing in my name on the day appointed. His doubts were evident, but he
      affected to be expectant. Not a word of Sarkeld could be spoken. My
      success appeared to be on a more visionary foundation the higher I
      climbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Jorian DeWitt had affirmed that the wealthy widow Lady Sampleman was
      to be had by my father for the asking. Placed as we were, I regarded the
      objections to his alliance with her in a mild light. She might lend me the
      money to appease the squire; that done, I would speedily repay it. I
      admitted, in a letter to my aunt Dorothy, the existing objections: but the
      lady had long been enamoured of him, I pleaded, and he was past the age
      for passionate affection, and would infallibly be courteous and kind. She
      was rich. We might count on her to watch over him carefully. Of course,
      with such a wife, he would sink to a secondary social sphere; was it to be
      regretted if he did? The letter was a plea for my own interests, barely
      veiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment of writing it, and moreover when I treated my father with
      especial coldness, my heart was far less warm in the contemplation of its
      pre-eminent aim than when I was suffering him to endanger it, almost
      without a protest. Janet and a peaceful Riversley, and a life of quiet
      English distinction, beckoned to me visibly, and not hatefully. The image
      of Ottilia conjured up pictures of a sea of shipwrecks, a scene of
      immeasurable hopelessness. Still, I strove toward that. My strivings were
      against my leanings, and imagining the latter, which involved no sacrifice
      of the finer sense of honour, to be in the direction of my lower nature, I
      repelled them to preserve a lofty aim that led me through questionable
      ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can it be you, Harry,&rsquo; my aunt Dorothy&rsquo;s reply ran (I had anticipated her
      line of reasoning, though not her warmth), &lsquo;who advise him to this
      marriage from a motive so inexplicably unworthy? That you will repay her
      the money, I do not require your promise to assure me. The money is
      nothing. It is the prospect of her life and fortune which you are
      consenting, if not urging him, to imperil for your own purposes. Are you
      really prepared to imitate in him, with less excuse for doing it, the
      things you most condemn? Let it be checked at the outset. It cannot be. A
      marriage of inclination on both sides, prudent in a worldly sense, we
      might wish for him, perhaps, if he could feel quite sure of himself. His
      wife might persuade him not to proceed in his law-case. There I have long
      seen his ruin. He builds such expectations on it! You speak of something
      worse than a mercenary marriage. I see this in your handwriting!&mdash;your
      approval of it! I have to check the whisper that tells me it reads like a
      conspiracy. Is she not a simpleton? Can you withhold your pity? and
      pitying, can you possibly allow her to be entrapped? Forgive my seeming
      harshness. I do not often speak to my Harry so. I do now because I must
      appeal to you, as the one chiefly responsible, on whose head the whole
      weight of a dreadful error will fall. Oh! my dearest, be guided by the
      purity of your feelings to shun doubtful means. I have hopes that after
      the first few weeks your grandfather will&mdash;I know he does not &lsquo;expect
      to find the engagement fulfilled&mdash;be the same to you that he was
      before he discovered the extravagance. You are in Parliament, and I am
      certain, that by keeping as much as possible to yourself, and living
      soberly, your career there will persuade him to meet your wishes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was of great length. In conclusion, she entreated me to
      despatch an answer by one of the early morning trains; entreating me once
      more to cause &lsquo;any actual deed&rsquo; to be at least postponed. The letter
      revealed what I had often conceived might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      My rejoinder to my aunt Dorothy laid stress on my father&rsquo;s pledge of his
      word of honour as a gentleman to satisfy the squire on a stated day. I
      shrank from the idea of the Riversley crow over him. As to the lady, I
      said we would see that her money was fastened to her securely before she
      committed herself to the deeps. The money to be advanced to me would lie
      at my bankers, in my name,&mdash;untouched: it would be repaid in the bulk
      after a season. This I dwelt on particularly, both to satisfy her and to
      appease my sense of the obligation. An airy pleasantry in the tone of this
      epistle amused me while writing it and vexed me when it had gone. But a
      letter sent, upon special request, by railway, should not, I thought, be
      couched in the ordinary strain. Besides one could not write seriously of a
      person like Lady Sampleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      I consulted my aunt Dorothy&rsquo;s scruples by stopping my father on his way to
      the lady. His carriage was at the door: I suggested money-lenders: he had
      tried them all. He begged me to permit him to start: but it was too
      ignominious to think of its being done under my very eyes, and I refused.
      He had tried the money-lenders yesterday. They required a mortgage solider
      than expectations for the sum we wanted. Dettermain and Newson had
      declined to undertake the hypothecation of his annuity. Providence pointed
      to Sampleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You change in a couple of nights, Richie,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Now I am always the
      identical man. I shall give happiness to one sincerely good soul. I have
      only to offer myself&mdash;let me say in becoming modesty, I believe so.
      Let me go to her and have it over, for with me a step taken is a thing
      sanctified. I have in fact held her in reserve. Not that I think Fortune
      has abandoned us: but a sagacious schemer will not leave everything to the
      worthy Dame. I should have driven to her yesterday, if I had not heard
      from Dettermain and Newson that there was a hint of a negotiation for a
      compromise. Government is fairly frightened.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He mused. &lsquo;However, I slept on it, and arrived at the conclusion this
      morning that my old Richie stood in imminent jeopardy of losing the fruit
      of all my toil. The good woman will advance the money to her husband. When
      I pledged my word to the squire I had reason to imagine the two months a
      sufficient time. We have still a couple of days. I have heard of men who
      lost heart at the eleventh hour, and if they had only hung on, with
      gallant faith in themselves, they would have been justified by the result.
      Faith works miracles. At least it allows time for them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His fertile ingenuity spared mine the task of persuading him to postpone
      the drive to Lady Sampleman. But that he would have been prompt to go, at
      a word from me, and was actually about to go when I entered his house, I
      could not question.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drove in manifest relief of mind to Dettermain and Newson&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had an appointment with Mr. Temple at a great political Club, to meet
      the gentlemen who were good enough to undertake the introduction of the
      infant member to the House of Commons. My incessantly twisting
      circumstances foiled the pleasure and pride due to me. From the Club I
      bent my steps to Temple&rsquo;s district, and met in the street young Eckart vom
      Hof, my champion and second on a memorable occasion, fresh upon London,
      and looking very Germanic in this drab forest of our city people. He could
      hardly speak of Deutschland for enthusiasm at the sight of the moving
      masses. His object in coming to England, he assured me honestly, was to
      study certain editions of Tibullus in the British Museum. When he deigned
      to speak of Sarkeld, it was to say that Prince Hermann was frequently
      there. I gave him no chance to be sly, though he pushed for it, at a
      question of the Princess Ottilia&rsquo;s health.
    </p>
    <p>
      The funeral pace of the block of cabs and omnibuses engrossed his
      attention. Suddenly the Englishman afforded him an example of the reserve
      of impetuosity we may contain. I had seen my aunt Dorothy in a middle line
      of cabs coming from the City, and was darting in a twinkling among wheels
      and shafts and nodding cab-horse noses to take her hand and know the
      meaning of her presence in London. She had family business to do: she said
      no more. I mentioned that I had checked my father for a day or two. She
      appeared grateful. Her anxiety was extreme that she might not miss the
      return train, so I relinquished her hand, commanded the cabman to hasten,
      and turned to rescue Eckart&mdash;too young and faithful a collegian not
      to follow his friend, though it were into the lion&rsquo;s den-from a terrific
      entanglement of horseflesh and vehicles brawled over by a splendid
      collision of tongues. Secure on the pavement again, Eckart humbly
      acknowledged that the English tongue could come out upon occasions. I did
      my best to amuse him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it amused him to see me take my seat in the House of Commons, and
      hear a debate in a foreign language, I cannot say; but the only pleasure
      of which I was conscious at that period lay in the thought that he or his
      father, Baron vom Hof, might some day relate the circumstance at Prince
      Ernest&rsquo;s table, and fix in Ottilia&rsquo;s mind the recognition of my having
      tried to perform my part of the contract. Beggared myself, and knowing
      Prince Hermann to be in Sarkeld, all I hoped for was to show her I had
      followed the path she traced. My state was lower: besides misfortune I now
      found myself exalted only to feel my profound insignificance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The standard for the House is a man&rsquo;s ability to do things,&rsquo; said Charles
      Etherell, my friendly introductor, by whom I was passingly, perhaps
      ironically, advised to preserve silence for two or three sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He counselled the study of Foreign Affairs for a present theme. I talked
      of our management of them, in the strain of Dr. Julius von Karsteg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s journalism, or clippings from a bilious essay; it won&rsquo;t do for the
      House,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Revile the House to the country, if you like, but not
      the country to the House.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When I begged him to excuse my absurdity, he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s full of promise, so long as you&rsquo;re silent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But to be silent was to be merely an obedient hound of the whip. And if
      the standard for the House was a man&rsquo;s ability to do things, I was in the
      seat of a better man. External sarcasms upon the House, flavoured with
      justness, came to my mind, but if these were my masters surrounding me,
      how indefinitely small must I be!
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the House on that first night of my sitting, I received Temple&rsquo;s
      congratulations outside, and, as though the sitting had exhausted every
      personal sentiment, I became filled with his; under totally new
      sensations, I enjoyed my distinction through the perception of my old
      comrade&rsquo;s friendly jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be there, too, some day,&rsquo; he said, moaning at the prospect of an
      extreme age before such honours would befall him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The society of Eckart prevented me from urging him to puff me up with his
      talk as I should have wished, and after I had sent the German to be taken
      care of by Mrs. Waddy, I had grown so accustomed to the worldly view of my
      position that I was fearing for its stability. Threats of a petition
      against me were abroad. Supposing the squire disinherited me, could I
      stand? An extraordinary appetite for wealth, a novel appreciation of it&mdash;which
      was, in truth, a voluntary enlistment into the army of mankind, and the
      adoption of its passions&mdash;pricked me with an intensity of hope and
      dread concerning my dependence on my grandfather. I lay sleepless all
      night, tossing from Riversley to Sarkeld, condemned, it seemed, to marry
      Janet and gain riches and power by renouncing my hope of the princess and
      the glory belonging to her, unless I should within a few hours obtain a
      show of figures at my bankers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had promised Etherell to breakfast with him. A note&mdash;a faint scream&mdash;despatched
      by Mrs. Waddy to Mr. Temple&rsquo;s house informed me that &lsquo;the men&rsquo; were upon
      them. If so, they were the forerunners of a horde, and my father was as
      good as extinguished. He staked everything on success; consequently, he
      forfeited pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good-bye to ambition, I thought, and ate heartily, considering robustly
      the while how far lower than the general level I might avoid falling. The
      report of the debates in morning papers&mdash;doubtless, more flowing and,
      perhaps, more grammatical than such as I gave ear to overnight&mdash;had
      the odd effect on me of relieving me from the fit of subserviency into
      which the speakers had sunk me.
    </p>
    <p>
      A conceit of towering superiority took its place, and as Etherell was kind
      enough to draw me out and compliment me, I was attacked by a tragic sense
      of contrast between my capacities and my probable fortunes. It was open to
      me to marry Janet. But this meant the loosening of myself with my own hand
      for ever from her who was my mentor and my glory, to gain whom I was in
      the very tideway. I could not submit to it, though the view was like that
      of a green field of the springs passed by a climber up the crags. I went
      to Anna Penrhys to hear a woman&rsquo;s voice, and partly told her of my
      troubles. She had heard Mr. Hipperdon express his confident opinion that
      he should oust me from my seat. Her indignation was at my service as a
      loan: it sprang up fiercely and spontaneously in allusions to something
      relating to my father, of which the Marquis of Edbury had been guilty.
      &lsquo;How you can bear it!&rsquo; she exclaimed, for I was not wordy. The
      exclamation, however, stung me to put pen to paper&mdash;the woman was not
      so remote in me as not to be roused by the woman. I wrote to Edbury, and
      to Heriot, bidding him call on the young nobleman. Late at night I was at
      my father&rsquo;s door to perform the act of duty of seeing him, and hearing how
      he had entertained Eckart, if he was still master of his liberty. I should
      have known him better: I expected silence and gloom. The windows were
      lighted brilliantly. As the hall-door opened, a band of stringed and wood
      instruments commenced an overture. Mrs. Waddy came to me in the hall; she
      was unintelligible. One thing had happened to him at one hour of the
      morning, and another at another hour. He was at one moment suffering the
      hands of the &lsquo;officers&rsquo; on his shoulder:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And behold you, Mr. Harry! a knock, a letter from a messenger, and he
      conquers Government!&rsquo; It struck me that the epitome of his life had been
      played in a day: I was quite incredulous of downright good fortune. He had
      been giving a dinner followed by a concert, and the deafening strains of
      the music clashed with my acerb spirit, irritating me excessively. &lsquo;Where
      are those men you spoke of?&rsquo; I asked her. &lsquo;Gone,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;gone long
      ago!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Paid?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was afraid to be precise, but repeated that they were long since gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I singled Jorian DeWitt from among the crowd of loungers on the stairs and
      landing between the drawing-rooms. &lsquo;Oh, yes, Government has struck its
      flag to him,&rsquo; Jorian said. &lsquo;Why weren&rsquo;t you here to dine? Alphonse will
      never beat his achievement of to-day. Jenny and Carigny gave us a
      quarter-of-an-hour before dinner&mdash;a capital idea!&mdash;&ldquo;VEUVE ET
      BACHELIER.&rdquo; As if by inspiration. No preparation for it, no formal taking
      of seats. It seized amazingly&mdash;floated small talk over the soup
      beautifully.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I questioned him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, dear, yes; there can&rsquo;t be a doubt about it,&rsquo; he answered, airily.
      &lsquo;Roy Richmond has won his game.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three urgent men round a great gentleman were extracting his
      affable approbation of the admirable nature of the experiment of the
      Chassediane before dinner. I saw that Eckart was comfortably seated, and
      telling Jorian to provide for him in the matter of tobacco, I went to my
      room, confused beyond power of thought by the sensible command of fortune
      my father, fortune&rsquo;s sport at times, seemed really to have.
    </p>
    <p>
      His statement of the circumstances bewildered me even more. He was in no
      hurry to explain them; when we met next morning he waited for me to
      question him, and said, &lsquo;Yes. I think we have beaten them so far!&rsquo; His
      mind was pre-occupied, he informed me, concerning the defence of a lady
      much intrigued against, and resuming the subject: &lsquo;Yes, we have beaten
      them up to a point, Richie. And that reminds me: would you have me go down
      to Riversley and show the squire the transfer paper? At any rate you can
      now start for Sarkeld, and you do, do you not? To-day: to-morrow at
      latest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I insisted: &lsquo;But how, and in what manner has this money been paid?&rsquo; The
      idea struck me that he had succeeded in borrowing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Transferred to me in the Bank, and intelligence of the fact sent to
      Dettermain and Newson, my lawyers,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;Beyond that, I know as
      little as you, Richie, though indubitably I hoped to intimidate them. If,&rsquo; 
      he added, with a countenance perfectly simple and frank, &lsquo;they expect me
      to take money for a sop, I am not responsible, as I by no means provoked
      it, for their mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I proceed. The money is useful to you, so I rejoice at it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Five and twenty thousand pounds was the amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No stipulation was attached to it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None. Of course a stipulation was implied: but of that I am not bound to
      be cognizant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Absurd!&rsquo; I cried: &lsquo;it can&rsquo;t have come from the quarter you suspect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where else?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought of the squire, Lady Edbury, my aunt, Lady Sampleman, Anna
      Penrhys, some one or other of his frantic female admirers. But the
      largeness of the amount, and the channel selected for the payment,
      precluded the notion that any single person had come to succour him in his
      imminent need, and, as it chanced, mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observing that my speculations wavered, he cited numerous instances in his
      life of the special action of Providence in his favour, and was bold
      enough to speak of a star, which his natural acuteness would have checked
      his doing before me, if his imagination had not been seriously struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You hand the money over to me, sir?&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Without a moment of hesitation, my dear boy,&rsquo; he melted me by answering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You believe you have received a bribe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is my entire belief&mdash;the sole conclusion I can arrive at. I
      will tell you, Richie: the old Marquis of Edbury once placed five thousand
      pounds to my account on a proviso that I should&mdash;neglect, is the
      better word, my Case. I inherited from him at his death; of course his
      demise cancelled the engagement. He had been the friend of personages
      implicated. He knew. I suspect he apprehended the unpleasant position of a
      witness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what was the stipulation you presume was implied?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something that passed between lawyers: I am not bound to be cognizant of
      it. Abandon my claims for a few thousands? Not for ten, not for ten
      hundred times the sum!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To be free from his boisterous influence, which made my judgement as
      unsteady as the weather-glass in a hurricane, I left my house and went
      straight to Dettermain and Newson, who astonished me quite as much by
      assuring me that the payment of the money was a fact. There was no mystery
      about it. The intelligence and transfer papers, they said, had not been
      communicated to them by the firm they were opposed to, but by a solicitor
      largely connected with the aristocracy; and his letter had briefly
      declared the unknown donator&rsquo;s request that legal proceedings should
      forthwith be stopped. They offered no opinion of their own. Suggestions of
      any kind, they seemed to think, had weight, and all of them an equal
      weight, to conclude from the value they assigned to every idea of mine.
      The name of the solicitor in question was Charles Adolphus Bannerbridge.
      It was, indeed, my old, one of my oldest friends; the same by whom I had
      been led to a feast and an evening of fun when a little fellow starting in
      the London streets. Sure of learning the whole truth from old Mr.
      Bannerbridge, I walked to his office and heard that he had suddenly been
      taken ill. I strode on to his house, and entered a house of mourning. The
      kind old man, remembered by me so vividly, had died overnight. Miss
      Bannerbridge perceived that I had come on an errand, and with her gentle
      good breeding led me to speak of it. She knew nothing whatever of the sum
      of money. She was, however, aware that an annuity had been regularly paid
      through the intervention of her father. I was referred by her to a Mr.
      Richards, his recently-established partner. This gentleman was ignorant of
      the whole transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the day I strove to combat the pressure of evidence in favour
      of the idea that an acknowledgement of special claims had been wrested
      from the enemy. Temple hardly helped me, though his solid sense was dead
      against the notions entertained by my father and Jorian DeWitt, and others
      besides, our elders. The payment of the sum through the same channel which
      supplied the annuity, pointed distinctly to an admission of a claim, he
      inclined to think, and should be supposed to come from a personage having
      cause either to fear him or to assist him. He set my speculations astray
      by hinting that the request for the stopping of the case might be a blind.
      A gift of money, he said shrewdly, was a singularly weak method of
      inducing a man to stop the suit of a life-time. I thought of Lady Edbury;
      but her income was limited, and her expenditure was not of Lady Sampleman,
      but it was notorious that she loved her purse as well as my aunt Dorothy,
      and was even more, in the squire&rsquo;s phrase, &lsquo;a petticoated parsimony.&rsquo; Anna
      Penrhys appeared the likelier, except for the fact that the commencement
      of the annuity was long before our acquaintance with her. I tried her on
      the subject. Her amazement was without a shadow of reserve. &lsquo;It &lsquo;s Welsh,
      it&rsquo;s not English,&rsquo; she remarked. I knew no Welshwoman save Anna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know the whole of his history?&rsquo; said she. Possibly one of the
      dozen unknown episodes in it might have furnished the clue, I agreed with
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of twenty-one thousand pounds placed to my credit in the Funds
      assuaged my restless spirit of investigation. Letters from the squire and
      my aunt Dorothy urged me to betake myself to Riversley, there finally to
      decide upon what my course should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now that you have the money, pray,&rsquo; St. Parsimony wrote,&mdash;&lsquo;pray be
      careful of it. Do not let it be encroached on. Remember it is to serve one
      purpose. It should be guarded strictly against every appeal for aid,&rsquo; 
      etc., with much underlining.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather returned the papers. His letter said &lsquo;I shall not break my
      word. Please to come and see me before you take steps right or left.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So here was the dawn again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could in a day or two start for Sarkeld. Meanwhile, to give my father a
      lesson, I discharged a number of bills, and paid off the bond to which
      Edbury&rsquo;s name was attached. My grandfather, I knew, was too sincerely and
      punctiliously a gentleman in practical conduct to demand a further
      inspection of my accounts. These things accomplished, I took the train for
      Riversley, and proceeded from the station to Durstan, where I knew Heriot
      to be staying. Had I gone straight to my grandfather, there would have
      been another story to tell.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLV. WITHIN AN INCH OF MY LIFE
    </h2>
    <p>
      A single tent stood in a gully running from one of the gravel-pits of the
      heath, near an iron-red rillet, and a girl of Kiomi&rsquo;s tribe leaned over
      the lazy water at half length, striking it with her handkerchief. At a
      distance of about twice a stone&rsquo;s-throw from the new carriage-road between
      Durstan and Bulsted, I fancied from old recollections she might be Kiomi
      herself. This was not the time for her people to be camping on Durstan.
      Besides, I feared it improbable that one would find her in any of the
      tracks of her people. The noise of the wheels brought the girl&rsquo;s face
      round to me. She was one of those who were babies in the tents when I was
      a boy. We were too far apart for me to read her features. I lay back in
      the carriage, thinking that it would have been better for my poor little
      wild friend if I had never crossed the shadow of her tents. A life caught
      out of its natural circle is as much in danger of being lost as a limb
      given to a wheel in spinning machinery; so it occurred to me, until I
      reflected that Prince Ernest might make the same remark, and deplore the
      damage done to the superior machinery likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      My movements appeared to interest the girl. She was up on a mound of the
      fast-purpling heath, shading her eyes to watch me, when I called at
      Bulsted lodge-gates to ask for a bed under Julia&rsquo;s roof that night. Her
      bare legs twinkled in a nimble pace on the way to Durstan Hall, as if she
      was determined to keep me in sight. I waved my hand to her. She stopped. A
      gipsy&rsquo;s girl&rsquo;s figure is often as good an index to her mind as her face,
      and I perceived that she had not taken my greeting favourably; nor would
      she advance a step to my repeated beckonings; I tried hat, handkerchief,
      purse, in vain. My driver observed that she was taken with a fit of the
      obstinacy of &lsquo;her lot.&rsquo; He shouted, &lsquo;Silver,&rsquo; and then &lsquo;Fortune.&rsquo; She
      stood looking. The fellow discoursed on the nature of gipsies. Foxes were
      kept for hunting, he said; there was reason in that. Why we kept gipsies
      none could tell. He once backed a gipsy prizefighter, who failed to keep
      his appointment. &lsquo;Heart sunk too low below his belt, sir. You can&rsquo;t reckon
      on them for performances. And that same man afterwards fought the gamest
      fight in the chronicles o&rsquo; the Ring! I knew he had it in him. But they&rsquo;re
      like nothing better than the weather; you can&rsquo;t put money on &lsquo;em and feel
      safe.&rsquo; Consequently he saw no good in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She sticks to her post,&rsquo; he said, as we turned into the Durstan grounds.
      The girl was like a flag-staff on the upper line of heathland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heriot was strolling, cigar in mouth, down one of the diminutive alleys of
      young fir in this upstart estate. He affected to be prepossessed by the
      case between me and Edbury, and would say nothing of his own affairs, save
      that he meant to try for service in one of the Continental armies; he
      whose susceptible love for his country was almost a malady. But he had
      given himself to women it was Cissy this, Trichy that, and the wiles of a
      Florence, the spites of an Agatha, duperies, innocent-seemings,
      witcheries, reptile-tricks of the fairest of women, all through his
      conversation. He had so saturated himself with the resources, evasions,
      and desperate cruising of these light creatures of wind, tide, and
      tempest, that, like one who has been gazing on the whirligoround, he saw
      the whole of women running or only waiting for a suitable partner to run
      the giddy ring to perdition and an atoning pathos.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cut short one of Heriot&rsquo;s narratives by telling him that this picking
      bones of the dish was not to my taste. He twitted me with turning parson.
      I spoke of Kiomi. Heriot flushed, muttering, &lsquo;The little devil!&rsquo; with his
      usual contemplative relish of devilry. We parted, feeling that severe
      tension of the old links keeping us together which indicates the lack of
      new ones: a point where simple affection must bear the strain of
      friendship if it can. Heriot had promised to walk half-way with me to
      Bulsted, in spite of Lady Maria&rsquo;s childish fears of some attack on him. He
      was now satisfied with a good-bye at the hall-doors, and he talked
      ostentatiously of a method that he had to bring Edbury up to the mark. I
      knew that same loud decreeing talk to be a method on his own behalf of
      concealing his sensitive resentment at the tone I had adopted: Lady
      Maria&rsquo;s carriage had gone to fetch her husband from a political dinner. My
      portmanteau advised me to wait for its return. Durstan and Riversley were
      at feud, however, owing to some powerful rude English used toward the
      proprietor of the former place by the squire; so I thought it better to
      let one of the grooms shoulder my luggage, and follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was dark; he chose the roadway, and I crossed the heath, meeting
      an exhilarating high wind that made my blood race: Egoism is not peculiar
      to any period of life; it is only especially curious in a young man
      beginning to match himself against his elders, for in him it suffuses the
      imagination; he is not merely selfishly sentient, or selfishly scheming:
      his very conceptions are selfish. I remember walking at my swiftest pace,
      blaming everybody I knew for insufficiency, for want of subordination to
      my interests, for poverty of nature, grossness, blindness to the fine
      lights shining in me; I blamed the Fates for harassing me, circumstances
      for not surrounding me with friends worthy of me. The central &lsquo;I&rsquo; 
      resembled the sun of this universe, with the difference that it shrieked
      for nourishment, instead of dispensing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My monstrous conceit of elevation will not suffer condensation into
      sentences. What I can testify to is, that for making you bless the legs
      you stand on, a knockdown blow is a specific. I had it before I knew that
      a hand was up. I should have fancied that I had run athwart a tree, but
      for the recollection, as I was reeling to the ground, of a hulk of a
      fellow suddenly fronting me, and he did not hesitate with his fist. I went
      over and over into a heathery hollow. The wind sang shrill through the
      furzes; nothing was visible but black clumps, black cloud. Astonished
      though I was, and shaken, it flashed through me that this was not the
      attack of a highwayman. He calls upon you to stand and deliver: it is a
      foe that hits without warning. The blow took me on the forehead, and might
      have been worse. Not seeing the enemy, curiosity was almost as strong in
      me as anger; but reflecting that I had injured no one I knew of, my nerves
      were quickly at the right pitch. Brushing some spikes of furze off my
      hands, I prepared for it. A cry rose. My impression seemed to be all
      backward, travelling up to me a moment or two behind time. I recognised a
      strange tongue in the cry, but too late that it was Romany to answer it.
      Instantly a voice was audible above the noisy wind: &lsquo;I spot him.&rsquo; Then
      began some good and fair fighting. I got my footing on grass, and liked
      the work. The fellow facing me was unmistakably gipsy-build. I, too, had
      length of arm, and a disposition to use it by hitting straight out, with
      footing firm, instead of dodging and capering, which told in my favour,
      and is decidedly the best display of the noble art on a dark night.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dancer went over as neatly as I had preceded him; and therewith I
      considered enough was done for vengeance. The thrill of a salmon on the
      gut is known to give a savage satisfaction to our original nature; it is
      but an extension and attenuation of the hearty contentment springing from
      a thorough delivery of the fist upon the prominent features of an
      assailant that yields to it perforce. Even when you receive such perfect
      blows you are half satisfied. Feeling conqueror, my wrath was soothed; I
      bent to have a look at my ruffian, and ask him what cause of complaint
      gipsies camping on Durstan could find against Riversley. A sharp stroke on
      the side of my neck sent me across his body. He bit viciously. In pain and
      desperation I flew at another of the tawny devils. They multiplied. I took
      to my heels; but this was the vainest of stratagems, they beat me in
      nimbleness. Four of them were round me when I wheeled breathless to take
      my chance at fighting the odds. Fiery men have not much notion of
      chivalry: gipsies the least of all. They yelled disdain of my summons to
      them to come on one by one: &lsquo;Now they had caught me, now they would pay
      me, now they would pound me; and, standing at four corners, they commended
      me to think of becoming a jelly. Four though they were, they kept their
      positions; they left it to me to rush in for a close; the hinder ones held
      out of arms&rsquo; reach so long as I was disengaged. I had perpetually to shift
      my front, thinking&mdash;Oh, for a stick! any stout bit of timber! My
      fists ached, and a repetition of nasty dull knocks on back and neck,
      slogging thumps dealt by men getting to make sure of me, shattered my
      breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cried out for a pause, offered to take a couple of them at a time: I
      challenged three-the fourth to bide. I was now the dancer: left, right,
      and roundabout I had to swing, half-stunned, half-strangled with gorge.
      Those terrible blows in the back did the mischief. Sickness threatened to
      undermine me. Boxers have breathing-time: I had none. Stiff and sick, I
      tried to run; I tottered, I stood to be knocked down, I dropped like a
      log-careless of life. But I smelt earth keenly, and the damp grass and the
      devil&rsquo;s play of their feet on my chin, chest, and thighs, revived a fit of
      wrath enough to set me staggering on my legs again. They permitted it, for
      the purpose of battering me further. I passed from down to up
      mechanically, and enjoyed the chestful of air given me in the interval of
      rising: thought of Germany and my father, and Janet at her window,
      complacently; raised a child&rsquo;s voice in my throat for mercy, quite
      inaudible, and accepted my punishment. One idea I had was, that I could
      not possibly fail as a speaker after this&mdash;I wanted but a minute&rsquo;s
      grace to fetch breath for an oration, beginning, &lsquo;You fools!&rsquo; for I
      guessed that they had fallen upon the wrong man. Not a second was allowed.
      Soon the shrewd physical bracing, acting momentarily on my brain, relaxed;
      the fitful illumination ceased: all ideas faded out-clung about my beaten
      body-fled. The body might have been tossed into its grave, for aught I
      knew.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVI. AMONG GIPSY WOMEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      I cannot say how long it was after my senses had gone when I began to
      grope for them on the warmest of heaving soft pillows, and lost the slight
      hold I had on them with the effort. Then came a series of climbings and
      fallings, risings to the surface and sinkings fathoms below. Any attempt
      to speculate pitched me back into darkness. Gifted with a pair of enormous
      eyes, which threw surrounding objects to a distance of a mile away, I
      could not induce the diminutive things to approach; and shutting eyes led
      to such a rolling of mountains in my brain, that, terrified by the
      gigantic revolution, I lay determinedly staring; clothed, it seemed
      positive, in a tight-fitting suit of sheet-lead; but why? I wondered why,
      and immediately received an extinguishing blow. My pillow was heavenly; I
      was constantly being cooled on it, and grew used to hear a croon no more
      musical than the unstopped reed above my head; a sound as of a breeze
      about a cavern&rsquo;s mouth, more soothing than a melody. Conjecture of my
      state, after hovering timidly in dread of relapses, settled and assured me
      I was lying baked, half-buried in an old river-bed; moss at my cheek, my
      body inextricable; water now and then feebly striving to float me out,
      with horrid pain, with infinite refreshingness. A shady light, like the
      light through leafage, I could see; the water I felt. Why did it keep
      trying to move me? I questioned and sank to the depths again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The excruciated patient was having his wet bandages folded across his
      bruises, and could not bear a motion of the mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mind&rsquo;s total apathy was the sign of recovering health. Kind nature put
      that district to sleep while she operated on the disquieted lower
      functions. I looked on my later self as one observes the mossy bearded
      substances travelling blind along the undercurrent of the stream, clinging
      to this and that, twirling absurdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where was I? Not in a house. But for my condition of absolute calm, owing
      to skilful treatment, open air, and physical robustness, the scene would
      have been of a kind to scatter the busy little workmen setting up the
      fabric of my wits. A lighted oil-cup stood on a tripod in the middle of a
      tent-roof, and over it the creased neck and chin of a tall old woman,
      splendid in age, reddened vividly; her black eyes and grey brows, and
      greyishblack hair fell away in a dusk of their own. I thought her
      marvellous. Something she held in her hands that sent a thin steam between
      her and the light. Outside, in the A cutting of the tent&rsquo;s threshold, a
      heavy-coloured sunset hung upon dark land. My pillow meantime lifted me
      gently at a regular measure, and it was with untroubled wonder that I came
      to the knowledge of a human heart beating within it. So soft could only be
      feminine; so firm still young. The bosom was Kiomi&rsquo;s. A girl sidled at the
      opening of the tent, peeping in, and from a mufed rattle of subpectoral
      thunder discharged at her in quick heated snaps, I knew Kiomi&rsquo;s voice.
      After an altercation of their monotonous gipsy undertones, the girl
      dropped and crouched outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was morning when I woke next, stronger, and aching worse. I was lying
      in the air, and she who served for nurse, pillow, parasol, and bank of
      herbage, had her arms round beneath mine cherishingly, all the fingers
      outspread and flat on me, just as they had been when I went to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kiomi!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, you be quiet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can I stand up a minute or two?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, and you won&rsquo;t talk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I submitted. This was our duel all day: she slipped from me only twice,
      and when she did the girl took her place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to think of Bulsted and Riversley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kiomi, how long have I been here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You &lsquo;ll be twice as long as you&rsquo;ve been.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A couple of days?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More like a dozen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just tell me what happened.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ghm-m-m,&rsquo; she growled admonishingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reflecting on it, I felt sure there must have been searching parties over
      the heath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kiomi, I say, how was it they missed me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She struck at once on my thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re fools.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did you cheat them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t tie a handkercher across their eyes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You half smothered me once, in the combe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You go to sleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you been doctor?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The growling tigerish &lsquo;Ghm-m-m&rsquo; constrained me to take it for a lullaby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kiomi, why the deuce did your people attack me?&rsquo; She repeated the sound
      resembling that which sometimes issues from the vent of a mine; but I
      insisted upon her answering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I &lsquo;ll put you down and be off,&rsquo; she threatened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brute of a girl! I hate you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hate away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me who found me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shan&rsquo;t. You shut your peepers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The other and younger girl sung out: &lsquo;I found you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Kiomi sent a volley at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did,&rsquo; said the girl; &lsquo;yes, and I nursed you first, I did; and mother
      doctored you. Kiomi hasn&rsquo;t been here a day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old mother came out of the tent. She felt my pulse, and forthwith
      squatted in front of me. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re hard to kill, and oily as a bean,&rsquo; said
      she. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve only to lie quiet in the sun like a handsome gentleman; I&rsquo;m
      sure you couldn&rsquo;t wish for more. Air and water&rsquo;s the doctor for such as
      you. You&rsquo;ve got the bound in you to jump the ditch: don&rsquo;t you fret at it,
      or you&rsquo;ll lose your spring, my good gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave off talking to me as a stranger,&rsquo; I bawled. &lsquo;Out with it; why have
      you kept me here? Why did your men pitch into me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;OUR men, my good gentleman!&rsquo; the old woman ejaculated. There was
      innocence indeed! sufficient to pass the whole tribe before a bench of
      magistrates. She wheedled: &lsquo;What have they against a handsome gentleman
      like you? They&rsquo;d run for you fifty mile a day, and show you all their
      tricks and secrets for nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My despot Kiomi fired invectives at her mother. The old mother retorted;
      the girl joined in. All three were scowling, flashing, showing teeth,
      driving the wordy javelin upon one another, indiscriminately, or two to
      one, without a pause; all to a sound like the slack silver string of the
      fiddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sang out truce to them; they racked me with laughter; and such laughter!&mdash;the
      shaking of husks in a half-empty sack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, on a sudden cessation of the storm of tongues, they agreed
      that I must have my broth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheer weariness, seasoned with some hope that the broth would give me
      strength to mount on my legs and walk, persuaded me to drink it. Still the
      old mother declared that none of her men would ever have laid hands on me.
      Why should they? she asked. What had I done to them? Was it their way?
    </p>
    <p>
      Kiomi&rsquo;s arms tightened over my breast. The involuntary pressure was like
      an illumination to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      No longer asking for the grounds of the attack on a mistaken person, and
      bowing to the fiction that none of the tribe had been among my assailants,
      I obtained information. The girl Eveleen had spied me entering Durstan.
      Quite by chance, she was concealed near Bulsted Park gates when the groom
      arrived and told the lodge-keeper that Mr. Harry Richmond was coming up
      over the heath, and might have lost his way. &lsquo;Richmond!&rsquo; the girl threw a
      world of meaning into the unexpected name. Kiomi clutched me to her bosom,
      but no one breathed the name we had in our thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eveleen and the old mother had searched for me upon the heath, and having
      haled me head and foot to their tent, despatched a message to bring Kiomi
      down from London to aid them in their desperate shift. They knew Squire
      Beltham&rsquo;s temper. He would have scattered the tribe to the shores of the
      kingdom at a rumour of foul play to his grandson. Kiomi came in time to
      smuggle me through an inspection of the tent and cross-examination of its
      ostensible denizens by Captain Bulsted, who had no suspicions, though he
      was in a state of wonderment. Hearing all this, I was the first to say it
      would be better I should get out of the neighbourhood as soon as my legs
      should support me. The grin that goes for a laugh among gipsies followed
      my question of how Kiomi had managed to smuggle me. Eveleen was my
      informant when the dreaded Kiomi happened to be off duty for a minute. By
      a hasty transformation, due to a nightcap on the bandages about the head,
      and an old petticoat over my feet, Captain William&rsquo;s insensible friend was
      introduced to him as the sore sick great-grandmother of the tribe, mother
      of Kiomi&rsquo;s mother, aged ninety-one. The captain paid like a man for doctor
      and burial fees; he undertook also to send the old lady a pound of snuff
      to assist her to a last sneeze or two on the right side of the grave, and
      he kept his word; for, deeming it necessary to paint her in a
      characteristic, these prodigious serpents told him gravely that she
      delighted in snuff; it was almost the only thing that kept her alive,
      barring a sip of broth. Captain William&rsquo;s comment on the interesting piece
      of longevity whose well-covered length and framework lay exposed to his
      respectful contemplation, was, that she must have been a devilish fine old
      lady in her day. &lsquo;Six foot&rsquo; was given as her measurement.
    </p>
    <p>
      One pound of snuff, a bottle of rum, and five sovereigns were the fruits
      of the captain&rsquo;s sensibility. I shattered my ribs with laughter over the
      story. Eveleen dwelt on the triumph, twinkling. Kiomi despised laughter or
      triumph resulting from the natural exercise of craft in an emergency. &lsquo;But
      my handsome gentleman he won&rsquo;t tell on us, will he, when we&rsquo;ve nursed him
      and doctored him, and made him one of us, and as good a stick o&rsquo; timber as
      grows in the forest?&rsquo; whined the old mother. I had to swear I would not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He!&rsquo; cried Kiomi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He may forget us when he&rsquo;s gone,&rsquo; the mother said. She would have liked
      me to kiss a book to seal the oath. Anxiety about the safety of their
      &lsquo;homes,&rsquo; that is, the assurance of an untroubled reception upon their
      customary camping-ground, is a peculiarity of the gipsies, distinguishing
      them, equally with their cleanliness and thriftiness, from mumpers and the
      common wanderers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is their tribute to civilization, which generally keeps them within the
      laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who that does not know them will believe that under their domestic system
      I had the best broth and the best tea I have ever tasted! They are very
      cunning brewers and sagacious buyers too; their maxims show them to direct
      all their acuteness upon obtaining quality for their money. A compliment
      not backed by silver is hardly intelligible to the pretty ones: money is a
      really credible thing to them; and when they have it, they know how to use
      it. Apparently because they know so well, so perfectly appreciating it,
      they have only vague ideas of a corresponding sentiment on the opposite
      side to the bargain, and imagine that they fool people much more often
      than they succeed in doing. Once duped themselves, they are the wariest of
      the dog-burnt; the place is notched where it occurred, and for ever
      avoided. On the other hand, they repose implicit faith in a reputation
      vouched for by their experience. I was amused by the girl Eveleen&rsquo;s
      dotting of houses over the breadth of five counties, where for this and
      that article of apparel she designed to expend portions of a golden
      guinea, confident that she would get the very best, and a shilling
      besides. The unwonted coin gave her the joy of supposing she cheated the
      Mint of that sum. This guinea was a present to the girl (to whom I owed my
      thrashing, by the way) that excused itself under cover of being a bribe
      for sight of a mirror interdicted by the implacable Kiomi. I wanted to
      have a look at my face. Now that the familiar scenes were beginning to
      wear their original features to me, my dread of personal hideousness was
      distressing, though Eveleen declared the bad blood in my cheeks and eyes
      &lsquo;had been sucked by pounds of red meat.&rsquo; I wondered, whether if I stood up
      and walked to either one of the three great halls lying in an obtuse
      triangle within view, I should easily be recognized. When I did see
      myself, I groaned verily. With the silence of profound resignation, I
      handed back to Eveleen the curious fragment of her boudoir, which would
      have grimaced at Helen of Troy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re feeling your nose&mdash;you&rsquo;ve been looking at a glass!&rsquo; Kiomi
      said, with supernatural swiftness of deduction on her return.
    </p>
    <p>
      She added for my comfort that nothing was broken, but confessed me to be
      still &lsquo;a sight&rsquo;; and thereupon drove knotty language at Eveleen. The girl
      retorted, and though these two would never acknowledge to me that any of
      their men had been in this neighbourhood recently, the fact was treated as
      a matter of course in their spiteful altercation, and each saddled the
      other with the mistake they had committed. Eveleen snatched the last word.
      What she said I did not comprehend, she must have hit hard. Kiomi&rsquo;s eyes
      lightened, and her lips twitched; she coloured like the roofing smoke of
      the tent fire; twice she showed her teeth, as in a spasm, struck to the
      heart, unable to speak, breathing in and out of a bitterly disjoined
      mouth. Eveleen ran. I guessed at the ill-word spoken. Kiomi sat eyeing the
      wood-ashes, a devouring gaze that shot straight and read but one thing.
      They who have seen wild creatures die will have her before them, saving
      the fiery eyes. She became an ashen-colour, I took her little hand.
      Unconscious of me, her brown fingers clutching at mine, she flung up her
      nostrils, craving air.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the picture of the woman who could not weep in her misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kiomi, old friend!&rsquo; I called to her. I could have cursed that other
      friend, the son of mischief; for she, I could have sworn, had been
      fiercely and wantonly hunted. Chastity of nature, intense personal pride,
      were as proper to her as the free winds are to the heaths: they were as
      visible to dull divination as the milky blue about the iris of her
      eyeballs. She had actually no animal vileness, animal though she might be
      termed, and would have appeared if compared with Heriot&rsquo;s admirable
      Cissies and Gwennies, and other ladies of the Graces that run to fall, and
      spend their pains more in kindling the scent of the huntsman than in
      effectively flying.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no consolation for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl Eveleen came in sight, loitering and looking, kicking her idle
      heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kiomi turned sharp round to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going. Your father&rsquo;s here, up at Bulsted. I&rsquo;ll see him. He won&rsquo;t
      tell. He&rsquo;ll come soon. You&rsquo;ll be fit to walk in a day. You&rsquo;re sound as a
      nail. Goodbye&mdash;I shan&rsquo;t say good-bye twice,&rsquo; she answered my attempt
      to keep her, and passed into the tent, out of which she brought a small
      bundle tied in a yellow handkerchief, and walked away, without nodding or
      speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What was that you said to Kiomi?&rsquo; I questioned Eveleen, who was quickly
      beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied, accurately or not: &lsquo;I told her our men&rsquo;d give her as good as
      she gave me, let her wait and see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Therewith she pouted; or, to sketch her with precision, &lsquo;snouted&rsquo; would
      better convey the vivacity of her ugly flash of features. It was an error
      in me to think her heartless. She talked of her aunt Kiomi affectionately,
      for a gipsy girl, whose modulated tones are all addressed to the soft
      public. Eveleen spoke with the pride of bated breath of the ferocious
      unforgivingness of their men. Perhaps if she had known that I traced the
      good repute of the tribes for purity to the sweeter instincts of the
      women, she would have eulogized her sex to amuse me. Gipsy girls, like
      other people, are fond of showing off; but it would have been a victory of
      education to have helped her to feel the distinction of the feminine sense
      of shame half as awfully and warmly as she did the inscrutable iron
      despotism of the males. She hinted that the mistake of which I had been
      the victim would be rectified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell your men I&rsquo;ll hunt them down like rats if I hear of it,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we were conversing my father arrived. Eveleen, not knowing him,
      would have had me accept the friendly covering of a mat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here &lsquo;s a big one! he&rsquo;s a clergyman,&rsquo; she muttered to herself, and ran to
      him and set up a gipsy whine, fronting me up to the last step while she
      advanced; she only yielded ground to my outcry.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father bent over me. Kiomi had prepared him for what he saw. I quieted
      his alarm by talking currently and easily. Julia Bulsted had despatched a
      messenger to inform him of my mysterious disappearance; but he, as his way
      was, revelling in large conjectures, had half imagined me seized by a gust
      of passion, and bound for Germany. &lsquo;Without my luggage?&rsquo; I laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, without your luggage, Richie,&rsquo; he answered seriously. His conceit of
      a better knowledge of me than others possessed, had buoyed him up. &lsquo;For I
      knew,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;we two do nothing like the herd of men. I thought you
      were off to her, my boy. Now!&rsquo; he looked at me, and this look of dismay
      was a perfect mirror. I was not a presentable object.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stretched his limbs on the heather and kept hold of my hand, looking
      and talking watchfully, doctor-like, doubting me to be as sound in body as
      I assured him I was, despite aches and pains. Eveleen hung near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These people have been kind to you?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, the biggest brutes on the earth,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! you say that, when I spotted you out in the dark where you might have
      lied to be eaten, and carried you and washed your bloody face, and watched
      you, and never slept, I didn&rsquo;t, to mother you and wet your head!&rsquo; cried
      the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father beckoned to her and thanked her appreciably in the yellow
      tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So these scoundrels of the high road fell upon you and robbed you,
      Richie?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You let him think they robbed you, and you had your purse to give me a
      gold guinea out of it!&rsquo; Eveleen cried, and finding herself in the wrong
      track, volubly resumed: &lsquo;That they didn&rsquo;t, for they hadn&rsquo;t time, whether
      they meant to, and the night black as a coal, whoever they were.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The mystery of my not having sent word to Bulsted or to Riversley
      perplexed my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Comfortable here!&rsquo; he echoed me, disconsolately, and glanced at the
      heath, the tent, the black circle of the broth-pot, and the wild girl.

      CHAPTER XLVII. MY FATHER ACTS THE CHARMER AGAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kiomi&rsquo;s mother was seen in a turn of the gravel-cutting, bearing purchases
      from Durstan village. She took the new circumstances in with a single cast
      up of her wary eyelids; and her, and her skill in surgery and art in
      medicine, I praised to lull her fears, which procured me the denomination
      of old friend, as well as handsome gentleman: she went so far as to add,
      in a fit of natural warmth, nice fellow; and it is the truth, that this
      term effected wonders in flattering me: it seemed to reveal to me how
      simple it was for Harry Richmond, one whom gipsies could think a nice
      fellow, to be the lord of Janet&rsquo;s affections&mdash;to be her husband. My
      heart throbbed; yet she was within range of a mile and a half, and I did
      not wish to be taken to her. I did wish to smell the piney air about the
      lake-palace; but the thought of Ottilia caused me no quick pulsations.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father remained an hour. He could not perceive the drift of my
      objection to go either to Bulsted or to Riversley, and desire that my
      misadventure should be unknown at those places. However, he obeyed me, as
      I could always trust him to do scrupulously, and told a tale at Bulsted.
      In the afternoon he returned in a carriage to convey me to the seaside.
      When I was raised I fainted, and saw the last of the camp on Durstan much
      as I had come to it first. Sickness and swimming of the head continued for
      several days. I was persecuted with the sensation of the carriage journey,
      and an iteration of my father&rsquo;s that ran: &lsquo;My son&rsquo;s inanimate body in my
      arms,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Clasping the lifeless body of my sole son, Harry Richmond,&rsquo; and
      other variations. I said nothing about it. He told me aghast that I had
      spat blood. A battery of eight fists, having it in the end all its own
      way, leaves a deeper indentation on its target than a pistol-shot that
      passes free of the vital chords. My convalescence in Germany was a melody
      compared with this. I ought to have stopped in the tent, according to the
      wise old mother&rsquo;s advice, given sincerely, for prudence counselled her to
      strike her canvas and be gone. There I should have lain, interested in the
      progress of a bee, the course of a beetle or a cloud, a spider&rsquo;s business,
      and the shaking of the gorse and the heather, until good health had grown
      out of thoughtlessness. The very sight of my father was as a hive of
      humming troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      His intense anxiety about me reflected in my mind the endless worry I had
      concerning him. It was the intellect which condemned him when he wore a
      joyful air, and the sensations when he waxed over-solicitous. Whether or
      not the sentences were just, the judges should have sometimes shifted
      places. I was unable to divine why he fevered me so much. Must I say it?&mdash;He
      had ceased to entertain me. Instead of a comic I found him a tragic
      spectacle; and his exuberant anticipations, his bursting hopes that fed
      their forcing-bed with the blight and decay of their predecessors, his
      transient fits of despair after a touch at my pulses, and exclamation of
      &lsquo;Oh, Richie, Richie, if only I had my boy up and well!&rsquo;&mdash;assuming
      that nothing but my tardy recovery stood in the way of our contentment&mdash;were
      examples of downright unreason such as contemplation through the comic
      glass would have excused; the tragic could not. I knew, nevertheless, that
      to the rest of the world he was a progressive comedy: and the knowledge
      made him seem more tragic still. He clearly could not learn from
      misfortune; he was not to be contained. Money I gave him freely, holding
      the money at my disposal his own; I chafed at his unteachable spirit,
      surely one of the most tragical things in life; and the proof of my love
      for him was that I thought it so, though I should have been kinder had he
      amused me, as in the old days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conceive to yourself the keeping watch over a fountain choked in its
      spouting, incessantly labouring to spin a jet into the air; now for a
      moment glittering and towering in a column, and once more straining to
      mount. My father appeared to me in that and other images. He would have
      had me believe him shooting to his zenith, victorious at last. I likewise
      was to reap a victory of the highest kind from the attack of the
      mysterious ruffians; so much; he said, he thought he could assure me of.
      He chattered of an intimidated Government, and Dettermain and Newson;
      duchesses, dukes, most friendly; innumerable invitations to country
      castles; and among other things one which really showed him to be capable
      of conceiving ideas and working from an initiative. But this, too, though
      it accomplished a temporary service, he rendered illusory to me by his
      unhappy manner of regarding it as an instance of his now permanent social
      authority. He had instituted what he called his JURY OF HONOUR COURT,
      composed of the select gentlemen of the realm, ostensibly to weigh the
      causes of disputes between members of their class, and decree the method
      of settlement: but actually, my father admitted, to put a stop to the
      affair between Edbury and me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was the origin of the notion, Richie. I carried it on. I dined some
      of the best men of our day. I seized the opportunity when our choicest
      &ldquo;emperor&rdquo; was rolling on wheels to propound my system. I mention the names
      of Bramham DeWitt, Colonel Hibbert Segrave, Lord Alonzo Carr, Admiral
      Loftus, the Earl of Luton, the Marquis of Hatchford, Jack Hippony,
      Monterez Williams,&mdash;I think you know him?&mdash;and little Dick
      Phillimore, son of a big-wig, a fellow of a capital wit and discretion; I
      mention them as present to convince you we are not triflers, dear boy. My
      argument ran, it is absurd to fight; also it is intolerable to be
      compelled to submit to insult. As the case stands, we are under a summary
      edict of the citizens, to whom chivalry is unknown. Well, well, I
      delivered a short speech. Fighting, I said, resembled butting,&mdash;a
      performance proper to creatures that grow horns instead of brains.. not to
      allude to a multitude of telling remarks; and the question &ldquo;Is man a
      fighting animal?&rdquo; my answer being that he is not born with spurs on his
      heels or horns to his head and that those who insisted on fighting should
      be examined by competent anatomists, &ldquo;ologists&rdquo; of some sort, to decide
      whether they have the excrescences, and proclaim them... touching on these
      lighter parts of my theme with extreme delicacy. But&mdash;and here I
      dwelt on my point: Man, if not a fighting animal in his glorious&mdash;I
      forgot what&mdash;is a sensitive one, and has the idea of honour. &ldquo;Hear,&rdquo;
       from Colonel Segrave, and Sir Weeton Slaterhe was one of the party. In
      fine, Richie, I found myself wafted into a breathing oration. I cannot, I
      confess it humbly, hear your &ldquo;hear, hear,&rdquo; without going up and off,
      inflated like a balloon. &ldquo;Shall the arbitration of the magistracy,
      indemnifications in money awarded by the Law-courts, succeed in
      satisfying,&rdquo;&mdash;but I declare to you, Richie, it was no platform
      speech. I know your term&mdash;&ldquo;the chaincable sentence.&rdquo; Nothing of the
      kind, I assure you. Plain sense, as from gentlemen to gentlemen. We
      require, I said, a protection that the polite world of Great Britain does
      not now afford us against the aggressions of the knave, the fool, and the
      brute. We establish a Court. We do hereby&mdash;no, no, not the &ldquo;hereby&rdquo;;
      quite simply, Richie&mdash;pledge ourselves&mdash;I said some other word
      not &ldquo;pledge&rdquo; to use our utmost authority and influence to exclude from our
      circles persons refusing to make the reparation of an apology for wanton
      common insults: we renounce intercourse with men declining, when guilty of
      provoking the sentiment of hostility, to submit to the jurisdiction of our
      Court. All I want you to see is the notion. We raise the shield against
      the cowardly bully which the laws have raised against the bloody one. &ldquo;And
      gentlemen,&rdquo;&rsquo; my father resumed his oration, forgetting my sober eye for a
      minute&mdash;&lsquo;"Gentlemen, we are the ultimate Court of Appeal for men who
      cherish their honour, yet abstain from fastening it like a millstone round
      the neck of their common-sense.&rdquo; Credit me, Richie, the proposition
      kindled. We cited Lord Edbury to appear before us, and I tell you we
      extracted an ample apology to you from that young nobleman. And let me
      add, one that I, that we, must impose it upon an old son to accept. He
      does! Come, come. And you shall see, Richie, society shall never repose an
      inert mass under my leadership. I cure it; I shake it and cure it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He promenaded the room, repeating: &lsquo;I do not say I am possessed of a
      panacea,&rsquo; and bending to my chin as he passed; &lsquo;I maintain that I can and
      do fulfil the duties of my station, which is my element, attained in the
      teeth of considerable difficulties, as no other man could, be he prince or
      Prime Minister. Not one,&rsquo; he flourished, stepping onward. &lsquo;And mind you,
      Richie, this,&rsquo; he swung round, conscious as ever of the critic in me,
      though witless to correct his pomp of style, &lsquo;this is not
      self-glorification. I point you facts. I have a thousand schemes&mdash;projects.
      I recognize the value of early misfortune. The particular misfortune of
      princes born is that they know nothing of the world&mdash;babies! I grant
      you, babies. Now, I do. I have it on my thumbnail. I know its wants. And
      just as I succeeded in making you a member of our Parliament in assembly,
      and the husband of an hereditary princess&mdash;hear me&mdash;so will I
      make good my original determination to be in myself the fountain of our
      social laws, and leader. I have never, I believe&mdash;to speak
      conscientiously&mdash;failed in a thing I have once determined on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The single wish that I might be a boy again, to find pleasure in his talk,
      was all that remained to combat the distaste I had for such oppressive
      deliveries of a mind apparently as little capable of being seated as a
      bladder charged with gas. I thanked him for getting rid of Edbury, and a
      touch of remorse pricked me, it is true, on his turning abruptly and
      saying: &lsquo;You see me in my nakedness, Richie. To you and my valet, the
      heart, the body!&rsquo; He was too sympathetic not to have a keen apprehension
      of a state of hostility in one whom he loved. If I had inclined to melt,
      however, his next remark would have been enough to harden me: &lsquo;I have
      fought as many battles, and gained as startling victories as Napoleon
      Buonaparte; he was an upstart.&rsquo; The word gave me a jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes he would indulge me transparently in a political controversy,
      confessing that my dialectical dexterity went far to make a Radical of
      him. I had no other amusement, or I should have held my peace. I tried
      every argument I could think of to prove to him that there was neither
      honour, nor dignity, nor profit in aiming at titular distinctions not
      forced upon us by the circumstances of our birth. He kept his position
      with much sly fencing, approaching shrewdness; and, whatever I might say,
      I could not deny that a vile old knockknee&rsquo;d world, tugging its forelock
      to the look of rank and chink of wealth, backed him, if he chose to be
      insensible to radical dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In my time,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;all young gentlemen were born Tories. The doctor
      no more expected to see a Radical come into the world from a good family
      than a radish. But I discern you, my dear boy. Our reigning Families must
      now be active; they require the discipline I have undergone; and I also
      dine at aldermen&rsquo;s tables, and lay a foundation-stone&mdash;as Jorian says&mdash;with
      the facility of a hen-mother: that should not suffice them. &lsquo;Tis not
      sufficient for me. I lay my stone, eat my dinner, make my complimentary
      speech&mdash;and that is all that is expected of us; but I am fully aware
      we should do more. We must lead, or we are lost. Ay, and&mdash;to quote
      you a Lord Mayor&rsquo;s barge is a pretty piece of gilt for the festive and
      luxurious to run up the river Thames in and mark their swans. I am
      convinced there is something deep in that. But what am I to do? Would you
      have me frown upon the people? Richie, it is prudent&mdash;I maintain it
      righteous, nay, it is, I affirm positively, sovereign wisdom&mdash;to
      cultivate every flower in the British bosom. Riposte me&mdash;have you too
      many? Say yes, and you pass my guard. You cannot. I fence you there. This
      British loyalty is, in my estimation, absolutely beautiful. We grow to a
      head in our old England. The people have an eye! I need no introduction to
      them. We reciprocate a highly cordial feeling when they line the streets
      and roads with respectful salutations, and I acknowledge their
      demonstrative goodwill. These things make us a nation. By heaven, Richie,
      you are, on this occasion, if your dad may tell you so, wrong. I ask
      pardon for my bluntness; but I put it to you, could we, not travelling as
      personages in our well-beloved country, count on civility to greet us
      everywhere? Assuredly not. My position is, that by consenting to their
      honest enthusiasm, we the identical effect you are perpetually crying out
      for&mdash;we civilize them, we civilize them. Goodness!&mdash;a Great
      Britain without Royalty!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He launched on a series of desolate images. In the end, he at least
      persuaded himself that he had an idea in his anxiety to cultivate the
      primary British sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      We moved from town to town along the South coast; but it was vain to hope
      we might be taken for simple people. Nor was he altogether to blame,
      except in allowing the national instinct for &lsquo;worship and reverence&rsquo; to
      air itself unrebuked. I fled to the island. Temple ran down to meet me
      there, and I heard that Janet had written to him for news of me. He
      entered our hotel a private person; when he passed out, hats flew off
      before him. The modest little fellow went along a double line of attentive
      observers on the pier, and came back, asking me in astonishment who he was
      supposed to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I petitioned for privacy here!&rsquo; exclaimed my father. It accounted for the
      mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple knew my feelings, and did but glance at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close upon Temple&rsquo;s arrival we had a strange couple of visitors. &lsquo;Mistress
      Dolly Disher and her husband,&rsquo; my father introduced them. She called him
      by one of his Christian names inadvertently at times. The husband was a
      confectioner, a satisfied shade of a man who reserved the exercise of his
      will for his business, we learnt; she, a bustling, fresh-faced woman of
      forty-five, with still expressive dark eyes, and, I guessed, the ideal
      remainder of a passion in her bosom. The guess was no great hazard. She
      was soon sitting beside me, telling me of the &lsquo;years&rsquo; she had known my
      father, and of the most affectionate friend and perfect gentleman he was
      of the ladies who had been in love with him; &lsquo;no wonder&rsquo;: and of his
      sorrows and struggles, and his beautiful voice, and hearts that bled for
      him; and of one at least who prayed and trusted he would be successful at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple and the pallid confectioner spent the day on board a yacht with my
      father. Mrs. Dolly stayed to nurse me and persuade me to swallow medicine.
      She talked of her youth, when, as a fashionable bootmaker&rsquo;s daughter, she
      permitted no bills to be sent in to Mr. Richmond, alleging, as a
      sufficient reason for it to her father, that their family came from
      Richmond in Yorkshire. Eventually, the bills were always paid. She had not
      been able to manage her husband so well; and the consequence was, that
      (she breathed low) an execution was out; &lsquo;though I tell him,&rsquo; she said
      tremulously, &lsquo;he &lsquo;s sure to be paid in the long run, if only he&rsquo;ll wait.
      But no; he is you cannot think how obstinate in his business. And my girl
      Augusta waiting for Mr. Roy Richmond, the wish of our hearts! to assist at
      her wedding; and can we ask it, and have an execution hanging over him?
      And for all my husband&rsquo;s a guest here, he&rsquo;s as likely as not to set the
      officers at work, do what I will, to-morrow or any day. Your father
      invited us, Mr. Harry. I forced my husband to come, hoping against hope;
      for your papa gave the orders, relying on me, as he believed he might, and
      my husband undertook them, all through me. There it stops; he hears
      reports, and he takes fright: in goes the bill: then it&rsquo;s law, and last
      Oh! I&rsquo;m ashamed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Disher&rsquo;s bill was for supplying suppers to the Balls. He received my
      cheque for the amount in full, observing that he had been confident his
      wife was correct when she said it would be paid, but a tradesman&rsquo;s
      business was to hasten the day of payment; and, for a penance, he himself
      would pacify the lawyers.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing of the settlement of Mr. Disher&rsquo;s claim, my father ahem&rsquo;d,
      speechless, which was a sign of his swallowing vexation. He remarked that
      I had, no doubt with the best intentions, encroached on his liberty. &lsquo;I do
      not like to have my debts disturbed.&rsquo; He put it to me, whether a man,
      carrying out a life-long plan, would not be disconcerted by the
      friendliest intervention. This payment to Disher he pronounced fatal in
      policy. &lsquo;You have struck a heavy blow to my credit, Richie. Good little
      Mistress Dolly brought the man down here&mdash;no select addition to our
      society&mdash;and we were doing our utmost to endure him, as the ladies
      say, for the very purpose... but the error stands committed! For the
      future, friend Disher will infallibly expect payments within the year.
      Credit for suppers is the guarantee of unlimited entertainments. And I was
      inspiring him with absolute confidence for next year&rsquo;s campaign. Money,
      you are aware, is no longer a question to terrify me. I hold proofs that I
      have conclusively frightened Government, and you know it. But this regards
      the manipulation of the man Disher. He will now dictate to me. A refresher
      of a few hundreds would have been impolitic to this kind of man; but the
      entire sum! and to a creditor in arms! You reverse the proper situations
      of gentleman and tradesman. My supperman, in particular, should be taught
      to understand that he is bound up in my success. Something frightened him;
      he proceeded at law; and now we have shown him that he has frightened us.
      An execution? My dear boy, I have danced an execution five years running,
      and ordered, consecutively, at the same house. Like other matters, an
      execution depends upon how you treat it. The odds are that we have
      mortally offended Mistress Dolly.&rsquo; He apologized for dwelling on the
      subject, with the plea that it was an essential part of his machinery of
      action, and the usual comparison of &lsquo;the sagacious General&rsquo; whose
      forethought omitted no minutiae. I had to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady professed to be hurt. The payment, however, put an end to the
      visit of this couple. Politic or not, it was a large sum to disburse, and
      once more my attention became fixed on the probable display of figures in
      my bankers&rsquo; book. Bonds and bills were falling due: the current expenses
      were exhausting. I tried to face the evil, and take a line of conduct,
      staggering, as I did on my feet. Had I been well enough, I believe I
      should have gone to my grandfather, to throw myself on his good-nature;
      such was the brain&rsquo;s wise counsel: but I was all nerves and alarms,
      insomuch that I interdicted Temple&rsquo;s writing to Janet, lest it should
      bring on me letters from my aunt Dorothy, full of advice that could no
      longer be followed, well-meant cautions that might as well be addressed to
      the mile-posts behind me. Moreover, Janet would be flying on the wind to
      me, and I had a craving for soft arms and the look of her eyebrows, that
      warned me to keep her off if I intended to act as became a man of good
      faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fair weather, sunny green sea-water speckled with yachts shooting and
      bounding, and sending me the sharp sense of life there is in dashed-up
      fountains of silvery salt-spray, would have quickened my blood sooner but
      for this hot-bed of fruitless adventure, tricksy precepts, and wisdom
      turned imp, in which my father had again planted me. To pity him seemed a
      childish affectation. His praise of my good looks pleased me, for on that
      point he was fitted to be a judge, and I was still fancying I had lost
      them on the heath. Troops of the satellites of his grand parade surrounded
      him. I saw him walk down the pier like one breaking up a levee. At times
      he appeared to me a commanding phantasm in the midst of phantasm figures
      of great ladies and their lords, whose names he told off on his return
      like a drover counting his herd; but within range of his eye and voice the
      reality of him grew overpowering. It seduced me, and, despite reason, I
      began to feel warm under his compliments. He was like wine. Gaiety sprang
      under his feet. Sitting at my window, I thirsted to see him when he was
      out of sight, and had touches of the passion of my boyhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      I listened credulously, too, as in the old days, when he repeated, &lsquo;You
      will find I am a magician, and very soon, Richie, mark me.&rsquo; His manner
      hinted that there was a surprise in store. &lsquo;You have not been on the brink
      of the grave for nothing.&rsquo; He resembled wine in the other conditions
      attached to its rare qualities. Oh for the choice of having only a little
      of him, instead of having him on my heart! The unfilial wish attacked me
      frequently: he could be, and was, so ravishing to strangers and light
      acquaintances. Did by chance a likeness exist between us? My sick fancy
      rushed to the Belthams for a denial. There did, of some sort, I knew; and
      the thought partitioned my dreamy ideas, of which the noblest, taking
      advantage of my physical weakness, compelled me to confess that it was a
      vain delusion for one such as I to hope for Ottilia. This looking at the
      roots of yourself, if you are possessed of a nobler half that will do it,
      is a sound corrective of an excessive ambition. Unfortunately it would
      seem that young men can do it only in sickness. With the use of my legs,
      and open-air breathing, I became compact, and as hungry and zealous on
      behalf of my individuality, as proud of it as I had ever been: prouder and
      hungrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first day of outing, when, looking at every face, I could reflect on
      the miraculous issue of mine almost clear from its pummelling, and above
      all, that my nose was safe&mdash;not stamped with the pugilist&rsquo;s brand&mdash;inspired
      a lyrical ebullition of gratitude. Who so intoxicated as the convalescent
      catching at health?
    </p>
    <p>
      I met Charles Etherell on the pier, and heard that my Parliamentary seat
      was considered in peril, together with a deal of gossip about my
      disappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father, who was growing markedly restless, on the watch for letters and
      new arrivals, started to pay Chippenden a flying visit. He begged me
      urgently to remain for another few days, while he gathered information,
      saying my presence at his chief quarters did him infinite service, and I
      always thought that possible. I should find he was a magician, he
      repeated, with a sort of hesitating fervour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had just waved my hand to him as the boat was bearing him away from the
      pier-head, when a feminine voice murmured in my ear, &lsquo;Is not this our
      third meeting, Mr. Harry Richmond?&mdash;Venice, Elbestadt, and the Isle
      of Wight?&rsquo; She ran on, allowing me time to recognize Clara Goodwin. &lsquo;What
      was your last adventure? You have been ill. Very ill? Has it been
      serious?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I made light of it. &lsquo;No: a tumble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You look pale,&rsquo; she said quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s from grieving at the loss of my beauty, Miss Goodwin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you really not been seriously ill?&rsquo; she asked with an astonishing
      eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her mock-loftily that I did not believe in serious illnesses coming
      to godlike youth, and plied her in turn with inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have not been laid up in bed?&rsquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, on my honour, not in bed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I would give much to be able to stop that boat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She amazed me. &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because it&rsquo;s going on a bad errand,&rsquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Goodwin, you perplex me. My father has started in that boat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I saw him.&rsquo; She glanced hastily at the foam in a way to show
      indifference. &lsquo;What I am saying concerns others... who have heard you were
      dangerously ill. I have sent for them to hasten across.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My aunt and Miss Ilchester?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who are they? Miss Goodwin, I&rsquo;ll answer any question. I&rsquo;ve been queerish,
      that&rsquo;s true. Now let me hear who they are, when you arrived, when you
      expect them. Where are they now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As to me,&rsquo; she responded with what stretched on my ears like an
      insufferable drawl, &lsquo;I came over last night to hire a furnished house or
      lodgings. Papa has an appointment attached to the fortifications yonder.
      We&rsquo;ll leave the pier, if you please. You draw too much attention on ladies
      who venture to claim acquaintance with so important a gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We walked the whole length of the pier, chatting of our former meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not here,&rsquo; she said, as soon as I began to question.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was led farther on, half expecting that the accessories of time and
      place would have to do with the revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bitter creature drew me at her heels into a linendraper&rsquo;s shop. There
      she took a seat, pitched her voice to the key of a lady&rsquo;s at a
      dinner-table, when speaking to her cavalier of the history or attire of
      some one present, and said, &lsquo;You are sure the illness was not at all
      feigned?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had me as completely at her mercy in this detestable shop as if I had
      been in a witness-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Feigned!&rsquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is no answer. And pray remember where you are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, the illness was not feigned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you have not made the most of it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What an extraordinary thing to say!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is no answer. And please do not imagine yourself under the necessity
      of acting every sentiment of your heart before these people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She favoured a shopman with half-a-dozen directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My answer is, then, that I have not made the most of it,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not even by proxy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Once more I&rsquo;m adrift.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are certainly energetic. I must address you as a brother, or it will
      be supposed we are quarrelling. Harry, do you like that pattern?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. What&rsquo;s the meaning of proxy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With the accent you give it, heaven only knows what it means. I would
      rather you did not talk here like a Frenchman relating his last
      love-affair in company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Must your voice escape control exactly at the indicatory words? Do you
      think your father made the most of it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of my illness? Oh! yes; the utmost. I should undoubtedly think so. That&rsquo;s
      his way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did you permit it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was what they call &ldquo;wandering&rdquo; half the time. Besides, who could keep
      him in check? I rarely know what he is doing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know what he wrote?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wrote?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That you were dying.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of me? To whom?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She scrutinized me, and rose from her chair. &lsquo;I must try some other shop.
      How is it, that if these English people cannot make a &ldquo;berthe&rdquo; fit to
      wear, they do not conceive the idea of importing such things from Paris? I
      will take your arm, Harry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have bought nothing,&rsquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have as much as I went for,&rsquo; she replied, and gravely thanked the
      assistant leaning on his thumbs across the counter; after which, dropping
      the graceless play of an enigma, she inquired whether I had forgotten the
      Frau von Dittmarsch.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had, utterly; but not her maiden name of Sibley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Goodwin, is she one of those who are coming to the island?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Frau von Dittmarsch? Yes. She takes an interest in you. She and I have
      been in correspondence ever since my visit to Sarkeld. It reminds me, you
      may vary my maiden name with the Christian, if you like. Harry, I believe
      you are truthful as ever, in spite&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be unjust,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I could think I was!&rsquo; she rejoined. &lsquo;Frau von Dittmarsch was at
      Sarkeld, and received terrible news of you. She called on me, at my
      father&rsquo;s residence over the water yonder, yesterday afternoon, desiring
      greatly to know&mdash;she is as cautious as one with a jewel in her
      custody&mdash;how it fared with you, whether you were actually in a dying
      state. I came here to learn; I have friends here: you were not alone, or I
      should have called on you. The rumour was that you were very ill; so I
      hired a furnished place for Frau von Dittmarsch at once. But when I saw
      you and him together, and the parting between you, I began to have fears;
      I should have countermanded the despatch I sent by the boat, had it been
      possible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It has gone! And tell me the name of the other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Frau von Dittmarsch has a husband.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not with her now. Oh! cruel! speak: her name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her name, Harry?&rsquo; Her title is Countess von Delzenburg.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not princess?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not in England.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Ottilia was here!
    </p>
    <p>
      My father was indeed a magician!

      CHAPTER XLVIII. THE PRINCESS ENTRAPPED
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not princess in England,&rsquo; could betoken but one thing&mdash;an incredible
      act of devotion, so great that it stunned my senses, and I thought of it,
      and of all it involved, before the vision of Ottilia crossing seas took
      possession of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Princess Ottilia, Miss Goodwin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Countess of Delzenburg, Harry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To see me? She has come!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harry, you talk like the boy you were when we met before you knew her.
      Yes and yes to everything you have to say, but I think you should spare
      her name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She comes thinking me ill?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dying.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m as strong as ever I was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should imagine you are, only rather pale.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you, tell me, Clara, seen her yourself? Is she well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pale: not unwell: anxious.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It may be about the political affairs of the Continent; they are
      disturbed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She spoke of me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is coming by the next boat?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my fear that she is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you fear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I answer you, Harry? It is useless now. Well, because she has been
      deceived. That is why. You will soon find it out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Prince Ernest is at Sarkeld?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In Paris, I hear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How will your despatch reach these ladies in time for them to come over
      by the next boat?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have sent my father&rsquo;s servant. The General&mdash;he is promoted at
      last, Harry&mdash;attends the ladies in person, and is now waiting for the
      boat&rsquo;s arrival over there, to follow my directions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t leave me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Goodwin had promised to meet the foreign ladies on the pier. We
      quarrelled and made it up a dozen times like girl and boy, I calling her
      aunt Clara, as in the old days, and she calling me occasionally son
      Richie: an imitation of my father&rsquo;s manner of speech to me when we formed
      acquaintance first in Venice. But I was very little aware of what I was
      saying or doing. The forces of my life were yoked to the heart, and
      tumbled as confusedly as the world under Phaethon charioteer. We walked on
      the heights above the town. I looked over the water to the white line of
      shore and batteries where this wonder stood, who was what poets dream of,
      deep-hearted men hope for, none quite believe in. Hardly could I; and
      though my relenting spinster friend at my elbow kept assuring me it was
      true that she was there, my sceptical sight fixed on the stale prominences
      visible in the same features which they had worn day after empty day of
      late. This deed of hers was an act of devotion great as death. I knew it
      from experience consonant to Ottilia&rsquo;s character; but could a princess,
      hereditary, and bound in the league of governing princes, dare so to brave
      her condition? Complex of mind, simplest in character, the uncontrollable
      nobility of her spirit was no sooner recognized by me than I was shocked
      throughout by a sudden light, contrasting me appallingly with this supreme
      of women, who swept the earth aside for truth. I had never before received
      a distinct intimation of my littleness of nature, and my first impulse was
      to fly from thought, and then, as if to prove myself justly accused, I
      caught myself regretting&mdash;no, not regretting, gazing, as it were, on
      a picture of regrets&mdash;that Ottilia was not a romantic little lady of
      semi-celestial rank, exquisitely rash, wilful, desperately enamoured,
      bearing as many flying hues and peeps of fancy as a love-ballad, and not
      more roughly brushing the root-emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had but been such an one, what sprightly colours, delicious
      sadness, magical transformations, tenderest intermixture of earth and
      heaven; what tears and sunbeams, divinest pathos: what descents from
      radiance to consolatory twilight, would have surrounded me for poetry and
      pride to dwell on! What captivating melody in the minor key would have
      been mine, though I lost her&mdash;the legacy of it all for ever! Say a
      petulant princess, a star of beauty, mad for me, and the whisper of our
      passion and sorrows traversing the flushed world! Was she coming? Not she,
      but a touchstone, a relentless mirror, a piercing eye, a mind severe as
      the Goddess of the God&rsquo;s head: a princess indeed, but essentially a
      princess above women: a remorseless intellect, an actual soul visible in
      the flesh. She was truth. Was I true? Not so very false, yet how far from
      truth! The stains on me (a modern man writing his history is fugitive and
      crepuscular in alluding to them, as a woman kneeling at the ear-guichet)
      burnt like the blood-spots on the criminal compelled to touch his victim
      by savage ordinance, which knew the savage and how to search him. And
      these were faults of weakness rather than the sins of strength. I might as
      fairly hope for absolution of them from Ottilia as from offended laws of
      my natural being, gentle though she was, and charitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was I not guilty of letting her come on to me hoodwinked at this moment? I
      had a faint memory of Miss Goodwin&rsquo;s saying that she had been deceived,
      and I suggested a plan of holding aloof until she had warned the princess
      of my perfect recovery, to leave it at her option to see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; Miss Goodwin assented: &lsquo;if you like, Harry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her compassion for me only tentatively encouraged the idea. &lsquo;It would,
      perhaps, be right. You are the judge. If you can do it. You are acting
      bravely.&rsquo; She must have laughed at me in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours wore on. My curse of introspection left me, and descending
      through the town to the pier, amid the breezy blue skirts and
      bonnet-strings, we watched the packet-boat approaching. There was in
      advance one of the famous swift island wherries. Something went wrong with
      it, for it was overtaken, and the steamer came in first. I jumped on
      board, much bawled at. Out of a crowd of unknown visages, Janet appeared:
      my aunt Dorothy was near her. The pair began chattering of my paleness,
      and wickedness in keeping my illness unknown to them. They had seen Temple
      on an excursion to London; he had betrayed me, as he would have betrayed
      an archangel to Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you not look at us, Harry?&rsquo; they both said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passengers were quitting the boat, strangers every one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harry, have we really offended you in coming?&rsquo; said Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt Dorothy took the blame on herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I scarcely noticed them, beyond leading them on to the pier-steps and
      leaving them under charge of Miss Goodwin, who had, in matters of luggage
      and porterage, the practical mind and aplomb of an Englishwoman that has
      passed much of her time on the Continent. I fancied myself vilely duped by
      this lady. The boat was empty of its passengers; a grumbling pier-man,
      wounded in his dignity, notified to me that there were fines for disregard
      of the Company&rsquo;s rules and regulations. His tone altered; he touched his
      hat: &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t know who you was, my lord.&rsquo; Janet overheard him, and her face
      was humorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We may break the rules, you see,&rsquo; I said to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We saw him landing on the other side of the water,&rsquo; she replied; so
      spontaneously did the circumstance turn her thoughts on my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you speak to him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You avoided him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aunty and I thought it best. He landed... there was a crowd.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Goodwin interposed: &lsquo;You go to Harry&rsquo;s hotel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grandada is coming down to-morrow or next day,&rsquo; Janet prompted my aunt
      Dorothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If we could seek for a furnished house; Uberly would watch the luggage,&rsquo; 
      Dorothy murmured in distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Furnished houses, even rooms at hotels, are doubtful in the height of the
      season,&rsquo; Miss Goodwin remarked. &lsquo;Last night I engaged the only decent set
      of rooms I could get, for friends of Harry&rsquo;s who are coming.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No wonder he was disappointed at seeing us&mdash;he was expecting them!&rsquo; 
      said Janet, smiling a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are sure to come,&rsquo; said Miss Goodwin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near us a couple of yachtsmen were conversing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll be back in a day or two,&rsquo; one said. &lsquo;When you &lsquo;ve once tasted
      that old boy, you can&rsquo;t do without him. I remember when I was a youngster&mdash;it
      was in Lady Betty Bolton&rsquo;s day; she married old Edbury, you know, first
      wife&mdash;the Magnificent was then in his prime. He spent his money in a
      week: so he hired an eighty-ton schooner; he laid violent hands on a Jew,
      bagged him, lugged him on board, and sailed away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What the deuce did he want with a Jew?&rsquo; cried the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the Jew supplied cheques for a three months&rsquo; cruise in the
      Mediterranean, and came home, I heard, very good friends with his pirate.
      That&rsquo;s only one of dozens.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The unconscious slaughterers laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On another occasion&rsquo;&mdash;I heard it said by the first speaker, as they
      swung round to parade the pier, and passed on narrating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not an hotel, if it is possible to avoid it,&rsquo; my aunt Dorothy, with
      heightened colour, urged Miss Goodwin. They talked together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grandada is coming to you, Harry,&rsquo; Janet said. &lsquo;He has business in
      London, or he would have been here now. Our horses and carriages follow
      us: everything you would like. He does love you! he is very anxious. I&rsquo;m
      afraid his health is worse than he thinks. Temple did not say your father
      was here, but grandada must have suspected it when he consented to our
      coming, and said he would follow us. So that looks well perhaps. He has
      been much quieter since your money was paid back to you. If they should
      meet... no, I hope they will not: grandada hates noise. And, Harry, let me
      tell you: it may be nothing: if he questions you, do not take fire; just
      answer plainly: I&rsquo;m sure you understand. One in a temper at a time I&rsquo;m
      sure &lsquo;s enough: you have only to be patient with him. He has been going to
      London, to the City, seeing lawyers, bankers, brokers, and coming back
      muttering. Ah! dear old man. And when he ought to have peace! Harry, the
      poor will regret him in a thousand places. I write a great deal for him
      now, and I know how they will. What are you looking at?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was looking at a man of huge stature, of the stiffest build, whose
      shoulders showed me their full breadth while he stood displaying
      frontwards the open of his hand in a salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Schwartz!&rsquo; I called. Janet started, imagining some fierce interjection.
      The giant did not stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      But others had heard. A lady stepped forward. &lsquo;Dear Mr. Harry Richmond!
      Then you are better? We had most alarming news of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed to the Frau von Dittmarsch, anciently Miss Sibley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The princess?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Frau von Dittmarsch clasped Miss Goodwin&rsquo;s hand. I was touching Ottilia&rsquo;s.
      A veil partly swathed her face. She trembled: the breeze robbed me of her
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our walk down the pier was almost in silence. Miss Goodwin assumed the
      guardianship of the foreign ladies. I had to break from them and provide
      for my aunt Dorothy and Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They went over in a little boat, they were so impatient. Who is she?&rsquo; 
      Dorothy Beltham asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Princess Ottilia,&rsquo; said Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you certain? Is it really, Harry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I confirmed it, and my aunt said, &lsquo;I should have guessed it could be no
      other; she has a foreign grace.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;General Goodwin was with them when the boat came in from the island,&rsquo; 
      said Janet. &lsquo;He walked up to Harry&rsquo;s father, and you noticed, aunty, that
      the ladies stood away, as if they wished to be unobserved, as we did, and
      pulled down their veils. They would not wait for our boat. We passed them
      crossing. People joked about the big servant over-weighing the wherry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy Beltham thought the water too rough for little boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She knows what a sea is,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet gazed steadily after the retreating figures, and then commended me
      to the search for rooms. The end of it was that I abandoned my father&rsquo;s
      suite to them. An accommodating linen-draper possessed of a sea-view, and
      rooms which hurled the tenant to the windows in desire for it, gave me
      harbourage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till dusk I scoured the town to find Miss Goodwin, without whom there was
      no clue to the habitation I was seeking, and I must have passed her
      blindly again and again. My aunt Dorothy and Janet thanked me for my
      consideration in sitting down to dine with them; they excused my haste to
      retire. I heard no reproaches except on account of my not sending them
      word of my illness. Janet was not warm. She changed in colour and voice
      when I related what I had heard from Miss Goodwin, namely, that &lsquo;some one&rsquo; 
      had informed the princess I was in a dying state. I was obliged to offer
      up my father as a shield for Ottilia, lest false ideas should tarnish the
      image of her in their minds. Janet did not speak of him. The thought stood
      in her eyes; and there lies the evil of a sore subject among persons of
      one household: they have not to speak to exhibit their minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a night of suspense I fell upon old Schwartz and Aennchen out in the
      earliest dawn, according to their German habits, to have a gaze at sea,
      and strange country and people. Aennchen was all wonder at the solitary
      place, Schwartz at the big ships. But when they tried to direct me to the
      habitation of their mistress, it was discovered by them that they had lost
      their bearings. Aennchen told me the margravine had been summoned to
      Rippau just before they left Sarkeld. Her mistress had informed Baroness
      Turckems of her intention to visit England. Prince Ernest was travelling
      in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour which brought me to Ottilia was noon. The arrangements of the
      ladies could only grant me thirty minutes, for Janet was to drive the
      princess out into the country to view the island. She and my aunt Dorothy
      had been already introduced. Miss Goodwin, after presenting them, insisted
      upon ceremoniously accompanying me to the house. Quite taking the vulgar
      view of a proceeding such as the princess had been guilty of, and perhaps
      fearing summary audacity and interestedness in the son of a father like
      mine, she ventured on lecturing me, as though it lay with me to restrain
      the fair romantic head, forbear from calling up my special advantages,
      advise, and stand to the wisdom of this world, and be the man of honour.
      The princess had said: &lsquo;Not see him when I have come to him?&rsquo; I reassured
      my undiscerning friend partly, not wholly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would it be commonly sensible or civil, to refuse to see me, having
      come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Goodwin doubted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could indicate forcibly, because I felt, the clear-judging brain and
      tempered self-command whereby Ottilia had gained her decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Goodwin nodded and gave me the still-born affirmative of politeness.
      Her English mind expressed itself willing to have exonerated the rash
      great lady for visiting a dying lover, but he was not the same person now
      that he was on his feet, consequently her expedition wore a different
      aspect:&mdash;my not dying condemned her. She entreated me to keep the
      fact of the princess&rsquo;s arrival unknown to my father, on which point we
      were one. Intensely enthusiastic for the men of her race, she would have
      me, above all things, by a form of adjuration designed to be a masterpiece
      of persuasive rhetoric, &lsquo;prove myself an Englishman.&rsquo; I was to show that
      &lsquo;the honour, interests, reputation and position of any lady (demented or
      not,&rsquo; she added) &lsquo;were as precious to me as to the owner&rsquo;: that &lsquo;no woman
      was ever in peril of a shadow of loss in the hands of an English
      gentleman,&rsquo; and so forth, rather surprisingly to me, remembering her
      off-hand manner of the foregoing day. But the sense of responsibility
      thrown upon her ideas of our superior national dignity had awakened her
      fervider naturalness&mdash;made her a different person, as we say when
      accounting, in our fashion, for what a little added heat may do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The half hour allotted to me fled. I went from the room and the house,
      feeling that I had seen and heard her who was barely of the world of
      humankind for me, so strongly did imagination fly with her. I kissed her
      fingers, I gazed in her eyes, I heard the beloved voice. All passed too
      swift for happiness. Recollections set me throbbing, but recollection
      brought longing. She said, &lsquo;Now I have come I must see you, Harry.&rsquo; Did it
      signify that to see me was a piece of kindness at war with her judgement?
      She rejoiced at my perfect recovery, though it robbed her of the plea in
      extenuation of this step she had taken. She praised me for abstaining to
      write to her, when I was stammering a set of hastily-impressed reasons to
      excuse myself for the omission. She praised my step into Parliament. It
      did not seem to involve a nearer approach to her. She said, &lsquo;You have not
      wasted your time in England.&rsquo; It was for my solitary interests that she
      cared, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      I brooded desperately. I could conceive an overlooking height that made
      her utterance simple and consecutive: I could not reach it. Topics which
      to me were palpitating, had no terror for her. She said, &lsquo;I have offended
      my father; I have written to him; he will take me away.&rsquo; In speaking of
      the letter which had caused her to offend, she did not blame the writer. I
      was suffered to run my eyes over it, and was ashamed. It read to me too
      palpably as an outcry to delude and draw her hither:&mdash;pathos and
      pathos: the father holding his dying son in his arms, his sole son, Harry
      Richmond; the son set upon by enemies in the night: the lover never daring
      to beg for a sight of his beloved ere he passed away:&mdash;not an
      ill-worded letter; read uncritically, it may have been touching: it must
      have been, though it was the reverse for me. I frowned, broke down in
      regrets, under sharp humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said, &lsquo;You knew nothing of it. A little transgression is the real
      offender. When we are once out of the way traced for us, we are in danger
      of offending at every step; we are as lawless as the outcasts.&rsquo; That
      meant, &lsquo;My turning aside to you originally was the blameable thing.&rsquo; It
      might mean, &lsquo;My love of you sets my ideas of duty at variance with my
      father&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled; nothing was uttered in a tone of despondency. Her high courage
      and breeding gave her even in this pitfall the smoothness which most women
      keep for society. Why she had not sent me any message or tidings of
      herself to Riversley was not a matter that she could imagine to perplex
      me: she could not imagine my losing faith in her. The least we could do, I
      construed it, the religious bond between us was a faith in one another
      that should sanctify to our souls the external injuries it caused us to
      commit. But she talked in no such strain. Her delight in treading English
      ground was her happy theme. She said, &lsquo;It is as young as when we met in
      the forest&rsquo;; namely, the feeling revived for England. How far off we were
      from the green Devonshire coast, was one of her questions, suggestive of
      our old yacht-voyage lying among her dreams. Excepting an extreme and
      terrorizing paleness, there was little to fever me with the thought that
      she suffered mortally. Of reproach, not a word; nor of regret. At the
      first touch of hands, when we stood together, alone, she said, &lsquo;Would
      hearing of your recovery have given me peace?&rsquo; My privileges were the
      touch of hands, the touch of her fingers to my lips, a painless hearing
      and seeing, and passionate recollection. She said, &lsquo;Impatience is not for
      us, Harry&rsquo;: I was not to see her again before the evening. These were the
      last words she said, and seemed the lightest until my hot brain made a
      harvest of them transcending thrice-told vows of love. Did they not mean,
      &lsquo;We two wait&rsquo;: therefore, &lsquo;The years are bondmen to our stedfastness.&rsquo; 
      Could sweeter have been said? They might mean nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was veiled when Janet drove her out; Janet sitting upright in her
      masterly way, smoothing her pet ponies with the curl of her whip, chatting
      and smiling; the princess slightly leaning back. I strode up to the
      country roads, proud of our land&rsquo;s beauty under a complacent sky. By happy
      chance, which in a generous mood I ascribed to Janet&rsquo;s good nature, I came
      across them at a seven miles&rsquo; distance. They were talking spiritedly: what
      was wonderful, they gave not much heed to me: they seemed on edge for one
      another&rsquo;s conversation: each face was turned to the other&rsquo;s, and after
      nodding an adieu, they resumed the animated discourse. I had been rather
      in alarm lest Ottilia should think little of Janet. They passed out of
      sight without recurring to a thought of me behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening I was one among a group of ladies. I had the opportunity of
      hearing the running interchange between Ottilia and Janet, which appeared
      to be upon equal terms; indeed, Janet led. The subjects were not very
      deep. Plain wits, candour, and an unpretending tongue, it seemed, could
      make common subjects attractive, as fair weather does our English woods
      and fields. The princess was attracted by something in Janet. I myself
      felt the sway of something, while observing Ottilia&rsquo;s rapt pleasure in her
      talk and her laughter, with those funny familiar frowns and current
      dimples twisting and melting away like a play of shadows on the eddies of
      the brook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I &lsquo;m glad to be with her,&rsquo; Janet said of Ottilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just in that manner she spoke in Ottilia&rsquo;s presence. Why it should
      sound elsewhere unsatisfactorily blunt, and there possess a finished
      charm, I could not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mentioned to Janet that I feared my father would be returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      She contained herself with a bridled &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We were of one mind as to the necessity for keeping him absent, if
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harry, you&rsquo;ll pardon me; I can&rsquo;t talk of him,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      I proposed half-earnestly to foil his return by going to London at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s manly; that&rsquo;s nice of you,&rsquo; Janet said.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was on our walk from the house at night. My aunt Dorothy listened,
      pressing my arm. The next morning Janet urged me to go at once. &lsquo;Keep him
      away, bring down grandada, Harry. She cannot quit the island, because she
      has given Prince Ernest immediate rendezvous here. You must not delay to
      go. Yes, the Countess of Delzenburg shall have your excuses. And no, I
      promise you I will run nobody down. Besides, if I do, aunty will be at
      hand to plead for the defence, and she can! She has a way that binds one
      to accept everything she says, and Temple ought to study with her for a
      year or two before he wears his gown. Bring him back with you and
      grandada. He is esteemed here at his true worth. I love him for making her
      in love with English boys. I leave the men for those who know them, but
      English boys are unrivalled, I declare. Honesty, bravery, modesty, and
      nice looks! They are so nice in their style and their way of talking. I
      tell her, our men may be shy and sneering,&mdash;awkward, I daresay; but
      our boys beat the world. Do bring down Temple. I should so like her to see
      a cricket-match between two good elevens of our boys, Harry, while she is
      in England! We could have arranged for one at Riversley.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I went, and I repressed the idea, on my way, that Janet had manoeuvred by
      sending me off to get rid of me, but I felt myself a living testimony to
      her heartlessness: for no girl of any heart, acting the part of friend,
      would have allowed me to go without a leave-taking of her I loved few
      would have been so cruel as to declare it a duty to go at all, especially
      when the chances were that I might return to find the princess wafted
      away. Ottilia&rsquo;s condescension had done her no good. &lsquo;Turn to the right,
      that&rsquo;s your path; on.&rsquo; She seemed to speak in this style, much as she made
      her touch of the reins understood by her ponies. &lsquo;I &lsquo;ll take every care of
      the princess,&rsquo; she said. Her conceit was unbounded. I revelled in
      contemptuous laughter at her assumption of the post of leader with
      Ottilia. However, it was as well that I should go: there was no trusting
      my father.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIX. WHICH FORESHADOWS A GENERAL GATHERING
    </h2>
    <p>
      At our Riversley station I observed the squire, in company with Captain
      Bulsted, jump into a neighbouring carriage. I joined them, and was called
      upon to answer various inquiries. The squire gave me one of his short
      tight grasps of the hand, in which there was warmth and shyness, our
      English mixture. The captain whispered in my ear: &lsquo;He oughtn&rsquo;t to be
      alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How&rsquo;s the great-grandmother of the tribe?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Bulsted nodded, as if he understood, but was at sea until I
      mentioned the bottle of rum and the remarkable length of that old lady&rsquo;s
      measurement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, to be sure! a grand old soul,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You know that scum of old,
      Harry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed, and so did he, at which I laughed the louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He laughs, I suppose, because his party&rsquo;s got a majority in the House,&rsquo; 
      said the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We gave you a handsome surplus this year, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sweated out of the country&rsquo;s skin and bone, ay!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were complimented by the Chancellor of the Exchequer!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, that fellow&rsquo;s compliments are like a cabman&rsquo;s, and cry fool:&mdash;he
      never thanks you but when he&rsquo;s overpaid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Bulsted applauded the sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did you keep out of knowledge all this time, Hal?&rsquo; my grandfather
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I referred him to the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hang it,&rsquo; cried Captain Bulsted, &lsquo;do you think I&rsquo;d have been doing duty
      for you if I&rsquo;d known where to lay hold of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, if you didn&rsquo;t shake hands with me, you touched my toes,&rsquo; said I,
      and thanked him with all my heart for his kindness to an old woman on the
      point of the grave. I had some fun to flavour melancholy with.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather resumed his complaint: &lsquo;You might have gone clean off, and
      we none the wiser.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are we quite sure that his head&rsquo;s clean on?&rsquo; said the mystified captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course we should run to him, wherever he was, if he was down on his
      back,&rsquo; the squire muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, ay, sir; of course,&rsquo; quoth Captain William, frowning to me to
      reciprocate this relenting mood. &lsquo;But, Harry, where did you turn off that
      night? We sat up expecting you. My poor Julia was in a terrible fright, my
      lad. Eh? speak up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I raised the little finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, oh,&rsquo; went he, happily reassured; but, reflecting, added: &lsquo;A bout of
      it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I dropped him a penitent nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s bad, though,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why did you tip me a bottle of rum, Captain William?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By George, Harry, you&rsquo;ve had a crack o&rsquo; the sconce,&rsquo; he exclaimed, more
      sagaciously than he was aware of.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather wanted to keep me by his side in London until we two should
      start for the island next day; but his business was in the city, mine
      toward the West. We appointed to meet two hours after reaching the
      terminus.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to me while giving directions to his man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You &lsquo;ve got him down there, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My father&rsquo;s in town, sir. He shall keep away,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Humph! I mayn&rsquo;t object to see him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This set me thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Bulsted&mdash;previously asking me in a very earnest manner
      whether I was really all right and sound&mdash;favoured me with a hint:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The squire has plunged into speculations of his own, or else he is
      peeping at somebody else&rsquo;s. No danger of the dad being mixed up with
      Companies? Let&rsquo;s hope not. Julia pledged her word to Janet that I would
      look after the old squire. I suppose I can go home this evening? My girl
      hates to be alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By all means,&rsquo; said I; and the captain proposed to leave the squire at
      his hotel, in the event of my failing to join him in the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But don&rsquo;t fail, if you can help it,&rsquo; he urged me; &lsquo;for things somehow, my
      dear Harry, appear to me to look like the compass when the needle gives
      signs of atmospheric disturbance. My only reason for saying so is common
      observation. You can judge for yourself that he is glad to have you with
      him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I told the captain I was equally glad; for, in fact, my grandfather&rsquo;s
      quietness and apparently friendly disposition tempted me to petition for a
      dower for the princess at once, so that I might be in the position to
      offer Prince Ernest on his arrival a distinct alternative; supposing&mdash;it
      was still but a supposition&mdash;Ottilia should empower me. Incessant
      dialogues of perpetually shifting tendencies passed between Ottilia and me
      in my brain&mdash;now dark, now mildly fair, now very wild, on one side at
      least. Never, except by downright force of will, could I draw from the
      phantom of her one purely irrational outcry, so deeply-rooted was the
      knowledge of her nature and mind; and when I did force it, I was no
      gainer: a puppet stood in her place&mdash;the vision of Ottilia melted out
      in threads of vapour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And yet she has come to me; she has braved everything to come.&rsquo; I might
      say that, to liken her to the women who break rules and read duties by
      their own light, but I could not cheat my knowledge of her. Mrs. Waddy met
      me in the hall of my father&rsquo;s house, as usual, pressing, I regretted to
      see, one hand to her side. &lsquo;Her heart,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;was easily set
      pitty-pat now.&rsquo; She had been, by her master&rsquo;s orders, examined by two of
      the chief physicians of the kingdom, &lsquo;baronets both.&rsquo; They advised total
      rest. As far as I could apprehend, their baronetcies and doings in high
      regions had been of more comfort than their prescriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What I am I must be,&rsquo; she said, meekly; &lsquo;and I cannot quit his service
      till he&rsquo;s abroad again, or I drop. He has promised me a monument. I don&rsquo;t
      want it; but it shows his kindness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A letter from Heriot informed me that the affair between Edbury and me was
      settled: he could not comprehend how.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is this new Jury of Honour? Who are the jurymen?&rsquo; he asked, and
      affected wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him for a thrashing in a curt reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father had left the house early in the morning. Mrs. Waddy believed
      that he meant to dine that evening at the season&rsquo;s farewell dinner of the
      Trump-Trick Club: &lsquo;Leastways, Tollingby has orders to lay out his
      gentlemen&rsquo;s-dinners&rsquo; evening-suit. Yesterday afternoon he flew down to
      Chippenden, and was home late. To-day he&rsquo;s in the City, or one of the
      squares. Lady Edbury&rsquo;s&mdash;ah! detained in town with the jaundice or
      toothache. He said he was sending to France for a dentist: or was it
      Germany, for some lady&rsquo;s eyes? I am sure I don&rsquo;t know. Well or ill, so
      long as you&rsquo;re anything to him, he will abound. Pocket and purse! You know
      him by this time, Mr. Harry. Oh, my heart!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud knock at the door had brought on the poor creature&rsquo;s palpitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      This visitor was no other than Prince Ernest. The name on his card was
      Graf von Delzenburg, and it set my heart leaping to as swift a measure as
      Mrs. Waddy&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing that I was in the house, he desired to see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We met, with a formal bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I congratulate you right heartily upon being out of the list of the
      nekron,&rsquo; he said, civilly. &lsquo;I am on my way to one of your watering-places,
      whither my family should have preceded me. Do you publish the names and
      addresses of visitors daily, as it is the custom with us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I relieved his apprehensions on that head: &lsquo;Here and there, rarely; and
      only at the hotels, I believe.&rsquo; The excuse was furnished for offering the
      princess&rsquo;s address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Possibly, in a year or two, we may have the pleasure of welcoming you at
      Sarkeld,&rsquo; said the prince, extending his hand. &lsquo;Then, you have seen the
      Countess of Delzenburg?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the day of her arrival, your Highness. Ladies of my family are staying
      on the island.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and invited me to bow to him. We bowed thus in the room, in the
      hall, and at the street-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      For what purpose could he have called on my father? To hear the worst at
      once? That seemed likely, supposing him to have lost his peculiar
      confidence in the princess, of which the courtly paces he had put me
      through precluded me from judging.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I guessed acutely that it was not his intention to permit of my
      meeting Ottilia a second time. The blow was hard: I felt it as if it had
      been struck already, and thought I had gained resignation, until, like a
      man reprieved on his road to execution, the narrowed circle of my heart
      opened out to the breadth of the world in a minute. Returning from the
      city, I hurried to my father&rsquo;s house, late in the afternoon, and heard
      that he had started to overtake the prince, leaving word that the prince
      was to be found at his address in the island. No doubt could exist
      regarding the course I was bound to take. I drove to my grandfather,
      stated my case to him, and by sheer vehemence took the wind out of his
      sails; so that when I said, &lsquo;I am the only one alive who can control my
      father,&rsquo; he answered mildly, &lsquo;Seems t&rsquo; other way,&rsquo; and chose a small snort
      for the indulgence of his private opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! this princess came over alone, and is down driving out with my girl
      under an alias?&rsquo; he said, showing sour aversion at the prospect of a
      collision with the foreign species, as expressive as the ridge of a cat&rsquo;s
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple came to dine with us, so I did not leave him quite to himself, and
      Temple promised to accompany him down to the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, go, if you like,&rsquo; the fretted old man dismissed me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got enough to think over. Hold him fast to stand up to me within
      forty-eight hours, present time; you know who I mean; I&rsquo;ve got a question
      or two for him. How he treats his foreign princes and princesses don&rsquo;t
      concern me. I&rsquo;d say, like the Prevention-Cruelty-Animal&rsquo;s man to the
      keeper of the menagerie, &ldquo;Lecture &lsquo;em, wound their dignity, hurt their
      feelings, only don&rsquo;t wop &lsquo;em.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t wish any harm to them, but what the
      deuce they do here nosing after my grandson!... There, go; we shall be
      having it out ha&rsquo; done with to-morrow or next day. I&rsquo;ve run the badger to
      earth, else I&rsquo;m not fit to follow a scent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He grumbled at having to consume other than his Riversley bread, butter,
      beef, and ale for probably another fortnight. One of the boasts of
      Riversley was, that while the rest of the world ate and drank poison, the
      Grange lived on its own solid substance, defying malefactory Radical
      tricksters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple was left to hear the rest. He had the sweetest of modest wishes for
      a re-introduction to Ottilia.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER L. WE ARE ALL IN MY FATHER&rsquo;S NET
    </h2>
    <p>
      Journeying down by the mail-train in the face of a great sunken sunset
      broken with cloud, I chanced to ask myself what it was that I seriously
      desired to have. My purpose to curb my father was sincere and good; but
      concerning my heart&rsquo;s desires, whitherward did they point? I thought of
      Janet&mdash;she made me gasp for air; of Ottilia, and she made me long for
      earth. Sharp, as I write it, the distinction smote me. I might have been
      divided by an electrical shot into two halves, with such an equal force
      was I drawn this way and that, pointing nowhither. To strangle the thought
      of either one of them was like the pang of death; yet it did not strike me
      that I loved the two: they were apart in my mind, actually as if I had
      been divided. I passed the Riversley station under sombre sunset fires,
      saddened by the fancy that my old home and vivacious Janet were ashes,
      past hope. I came on the smell of salt air, and had that other spirit of
      woman around me, of whom the controlled seadeeps were an image, who spoke
      to my soul like starlight. Much wise counsel, and impatience of the
      wisdom, went on within me. I walked like a man with a yawning wound, and
      had to whip the sense of passion for a drug. Toward which one it strove I
      know not; it was blind and stormy as the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a boatman would take me across. The lights of the island lay like a
      crown on the water. I paced the ramparts, eyeing them, breathing the keen
      salt of thundering waves, until they were robbed of their magic by the
      coloured Fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, I have learnt, out of the conflict of sensations such as I then
      underwent that a young man&rsquo;s brain and morality, supposing him not to lean
      overmuch to sickly sentiment, becomes gradually enriched and strengthened,
      and himself shaped for capable manhood. I was partly conscious of a better
      condition in the morning; and a sober morning it was to me after my long
      sentinel&rsquo;s step to and fro. I found myself possessed of one key&mdash;whether
      the right one or not&mdash;wherewith to read the princess, which was never
      possible to me when I was under stress of passion, or of hope or despair;
      my perplexities over what she said, how she looked, ceased to trouble me.
      I read her by this strange light: that she was a woman who could only love
      intelligently&mdash;love, that is, in the sense of giving herself. She had
      the power of passion, and it could be stirred; but he who kindled it
      wrecked his chance if he could not stand clear in her intellect&rsquo;s
      unsparing gaze. Twice already she must have felt herself disillusioned by
      me. This third time, possibly, she blamed her own fatally credulous
      tenderness, not me; but it was her third awakening, and could affection
      and warmth of heart combat it? Her child&rsquo;s enthusiasm for my country had
      prepared her for the impression which the waxen mind of the dreamy invalid
      received deeply; and so, aided by the emotional blood of youth, she gave
      me place in her imagination, probing me still curiously, as I remembered,
      at a season when her sedate mind was attaining to joint deliberations with
      the impulsive overgenerous heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then ensued for her the successive shocks of discernment. She knew the to
      have some of the vices, many follies, all the intemperateness of men who
      carve a way for themselves in the common roads, if barely they do that.
      And resembling common men (men, in a judgement elective as hers, common,
      however able), I was not assuredly to be separated by her from my
      associations; from the thought of my father, for example. Her look at him
      in the lake-palace library, and her manner in unfolding and folding his
      recent letter to her, and in one or two necessitated allusions, embraced a
      kind of grave, pitiful humour, beyond smiles or any outward expression, as
      if the acknowledgement that it was so quite obliterated the wonder that it
      should be so&mdash;that one such as he could exercise influence upon her
      destiny. Or she may have made her reckoning generally, not personally,
      upon our human destinies: it is the more likely, if, as I divine, the calm
      oval of her lifted eyelids contemplated him in the fulness of the
      recognition that this world, of which we hope unuttered things, can be
      shifted and swayed by an ignis-fatuus. The father of one now seen through,
      could hardly fail of being transfixed himself. It was horrible to think
      of. I would rather have added a vice to my faults than that she should
      have penetrated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearing the island, I was reminded of the early morning when I landed on
      the Flemish flats. I did not expect a similar surprise, but before my
      rowers had pulled in, the tall beaconhead of old Schwartz notified that
      his mistress might be abroad. Janet walked with her. I ran up the steps to
      salute them, and had Ottilia&rsquo;s hand in mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Prince Ernest has arrived?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My father came yesterday evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you leave to-day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot tell; he will decide.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed a good omen, until I scanned Janet&rsquo;s sombre face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will not see us out for the rest of the day, Harry,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is your arrangement?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your own?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mine, if you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something hard in her way of speaking, as though she blamed me,
      and the princess were under her protection against me. She vouchsafed no
      friendly significance of look and tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of my readiness to criticize her (which in our language means
      condemn) for always assuming leadership with whomsoever she might be, I
      was impressed by the air of high-bred friendliness existing between her
      and the princess. Their interchange was pleasant to hear. Ottilia had
      caught the spirit of her frank manner of speech; and she, though in a less
      degree, the princess&rsquo;s fine ease and sweetness. They conversed,
      apparently, like equal minds. On material points, Janet unhesitatingly
      led. It was she who brought the walk to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Harry, you had better go and have a little sleep. I should like to
      speak to you early.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ottilia immediately put her hand out to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I begged permission to see her to her door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet replied for her, indicating old Schwartz: &lsquo;We have a protector, you
      see, six feet and a half.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, Schwartz was following her to the steps of her hotel. She
      saw me, and waited. For a wonder, she displayed reluctance in disburdening
      herself of what she had to say. &lsquo;Harry, you know that he has come? He and
      Prince Ernest came together. Get him to leave the island at once: he can
      return to-morrow. Grandada writes of wishing to see him. Get him away
      to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is the prince going to stay here?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. I daresay I am only guessing; I hope so. He has threatened the
      prince.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What with?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Harry, can&rsquo;t you understand? I&rsquo;m no reader of etiquette, but even I
      can see that the story of a young princess travelling over to England
      alone to visit... and you..., and her father fetching her away! The prince
      is almost at his mercy, unless you make the man behave like a gentleman.
      This is exactly the thing Miss Goodwin feared!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But who&rsquo;s to hear of the story?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet gave an impatient sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean that my father has threatened to publish it, Janet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t say he has. He has made the prince afraid to move: that I think
      is true.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did the princess herself mention it to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She understands her situation, I am sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did she speak of &ldquo;the man,&rdquo; as you call him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes: not as I do. You must try by-and-by to forgive me. Whether he set a
      trap or not, he has decoyed her&mdash;don&rsquo;t frown at words&mdash;and it
      remains for you to act as I don&rsquo;t doubt you will; but lose no time.
      Determine. Oh! if I were a man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would muzzle us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Muzzle, or anything you please; I would make any one related to me behave
      honourably. I would give him the alternative...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You foolish girl! suppose he took it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would make him feel my will. He should not take it. Keep to the
      circumstances, Harry. If you have no control over him&mdash;I should think
      I was not fit to live, in such a position! No control over him at a moment
      like this? and the princess in danger of having her reputation hurt!
      Surely, Harry! But why should I speak to you as if you were undecided!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At the house where you sleep. He surrendered his rooms here very kindly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aunty has seen him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet blushed: I thought I knew why. It was for subtler reasons than I
      should have credited her with conceiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She sent for him, at my request, late last night. She believed her
      influence would be decisive. So do I. She could not even make the man
      perceive that he was acting&mdash;to use her poor dear old-fashioned word&mdash;reprehensibly
      in frightening the prince to further your interests. From what I gathered
      he went off in a song about them. She said he talked so well! And aunty
      Dorothy, too! I should nearly as soon have expected grandada to come in
      for his turn of the delusion. How I wish he was here! Uberly goes by the
      first boat to bring him down. I feel with Miss Goodwin that it will be a
      disgrace for all of us&mdash;the country&rsquo;s disgrace. As for our family!...
      Harry, and your name! Good-bye. Do your best.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in the mood to ask, &lsquo;On behalf of the country?&rsquo; She had, however, a
      glow and a ringing articulation in her excitement that forbade trifling; a
      minute&rsquo;s reflection set me weighing my power of will against my father&rsquo;s.
      I nodded to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come to us when you are at liberty,&rsquo; she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said that I weighed my power of will against my father&rsquo;s.
      Contemplation of the state of the scales did not send me striding to meet
      him. Let it be remembered&mdash;I had it strongly in memory that he
      habitually deluded himself under the supposition that the turn of all
      events having an aspect of good fortune had been planned by him of old,
      and were offered to him as the legitimately-won fruits of a politic life.
      While others deemed him mad, or merely reckless, wild, a creature living
      for the day, he enjoyed the conceit of being a profound schemer, in which
      he was fortified by a really extraordinary adroitness to take advantage of
      occurrences: and because he was prompt in an emergency, and quick to
      profit of a crisis, he was deluded to imagine that he had created it. Such
      a man would be with difficulty brought to surrender his prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, there was his love for me. &lsquo;Pater est, Pamphile;&mdash;difficile
      est.&rsquo; How was this vast conceit of a not unreal paternal love to be
      encountered? The sense of honour and of decency might appeal to him
      personally; would either of them get a hearing if he fancied them to be
      standing in opposition to my dearest interests? I, unhappily, as the case
      would be sure to present itself to him, appeared the living example of his
      eminently politic career. After establishing me the heir of one of the
      wealthiest of English commoners, would he be likely to forego any
      desperate chance of ennobling me by the brilliant marriage? His dreadful
      devotion to me extinguished the hope that he would, unless I should happen
      to be particularly masterful in dealing with him. I heard his nimble and
      overwhelming volubility like a flood advancing. That could be withstood,
      and his arguments and persuasions. But by what steps could I restrain the
      man himself? I said &lsquo;the man,&rsquo; as Janet did. He figured in my apprehensive
      imagination as an engine more than as an individual. Lassitude oppressed
      me. I felt that I required every access of strength possible, physical
      besides moral, in anticipation of our encounter, and took a swim in
      sea-water, which displaced my drowsy fit, and some alarming intimations of
      cowardice menacing a paralysis of the will: I had not altogether recovered
      from my gipsy drubbing. And now I wanted to have the contest over
      instantly. It seemed presumable that my father had slept at my lodgings.
      There, however, the report of him was, that he had inspected the rooms,
      highly complimented the owner of them, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to the pier, I learnt that he had set sail in his hired yacht
      for the sister town on the Solent, at an early hour:&mdash;for what
      purpose? I knew of it too late to intercept it. One of the squire&rsquo;s horses
      trotted me over; I came upon Colonel Hibbert Segrave near the Club-house,
      and heard that my father was off again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But your German prince and papa-in-law shall be free of the Club for the
      next fortnight,&rsquo; said he, and cordially asked to have the date of the
      marriage. My face astonished him. He excused himself for speaking of this
      happy event so abruptly. A sting of downright anger drove me back at a
      rapid canter. It flashed on me that this Prince Ernest, whose suave
      fashion of depressing me, and philosophical skill in managing his
      daughter, had induced me to regard him as a pattern of astuteness, was
      really both credulous and feeble, or else supremely unsuspecting: and I
      was confirmed in the latter idea on hearing that he had sailed to visit
      the opposite harbour and docks on board my father&rsquo;s yacht. Janet shared my
      secret opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The prince is a gentleman,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her wrath and disgust were unspeakable. My aunt Dorothy blamed her for
      overdue severity. &lsquo;The prince, I suppose, goes of his own free will where
      he pleases.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet burst out, &lsquo;Oh! can&rsquo;t you see through it, aunty? The prince goes
      about without at all knowing that the person who takes him&mdash;Harry
      sees it&mdash;is making him compromise himself: and by-and-by the prince
      will discover that he has no will of his own, whatever he may wish to
      resolve upon doing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he quite against Harry?&rsquo; asked my aunt Dorothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear aunty, he &lsquo;s a prince, and a proud man. He will never in his
      lifetime consent to... to what you mean, without being hounded into it. I
      haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea whether anything will force him. I know that
      the princess would have too much pride to submit, even to save her name.
      But it &lsquo;s her name that &lsquo;s in danger. Think of the scandal to a sovereign
      princess! I know the signification of that now; I used to laugh at Harry&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;sovereign princess.&rdquo; She is one, and thorough! there is no one like her.
      Don&rsquo;t you understand, aunty, that the intrigue, plot&mdash;I don&rsquo;t choose
      to be nice upon terms&mdash;may be perfectly successful, and do good to
      nobody. The prince may be tricked; the princess, I am sure, will not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet&rsquo;s affectation of an intimate and peculiar knowledge of the princess
      was a show of her character that I was accustomed to: still, it was
      evident they had conversed much, and perhaps intimately. I led her to tell
      me that the princess had expressed no views upon my father. &lsquo;He does not
      come within her scope, Harry.&rsquo; &lsquo;Scope&rsquo; was one of Janet&rsquo;s new words,
      wherewith she would now and then fall to seasoning a serviceable but
      savourless outworn vocabulary of the common table. In spite of that and
      other offences, rendered prominent to me by the lifting of her lip and her
      frown when she had to speak of my father, I was on her side, not on his.
      Her estimation of the princess was soundly based. She discerned exactly
      the nature of Ottilia&rsquo;s entanglement, and her peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      She and my aunt Dorothy passed the afternoon with Ottilia, while I crossed
      the head of the street, looking down at the one house, where the princess
      was virtually imprisoned, either by her father&rsquo;s express injunction or her
      own discretion. And it was as well that she should not be out. The
      yachting season had brought many London men to the island. I met several
      who had not forgotten the newspaper-paragraph assertions and
      contradictions. Lord Alton, Admiral Loftus, and others were on the pier
      and in the outfitters&rsquo; shops, eager for gossip, as the languid stretch of
      indolence inclines men to be. The Admiral asked me for the whereabout of
      Prince Ernest&rsquo;s territory. He too said that the prince would be free of
      the Club during his residence, adding:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is he?&rsquo;&mdash;not a question demanding an answer. The men might
      have let the princess go by, but there would have been questions urgently
      demanding answers had she been seen by their women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the evening my father&rsquo;s yacht was sighted from the pier. Just as
      he reached his moorings, and his boat was hauled round, the last steamer
      came in. Sharp-eyed Janet saw the squire on board among a crowd, and
      Temple next to him, supporting his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has grandada been ill?&rsquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      My chief concern was to see my father&rsquo;s head rising in the midst of the
      crowd, uncovering repeatedly. Prince Ernest and General Goodwin were
      behind him, stepping off the lower pier-platform. The General did not look
      pleased. My grandfather, with Janet holding his arm, in the place of
      Temple, stood waiting to see that his man had done his duty by the
      luggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father, advancing, perceived me, and almost taking the squire into his
      affectionate salutation, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing could be more opportune than your arrival, Mr. Beltham.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire rejoined: &lsquo;I wanted to see you, Mr. Richmond; and not in
      public.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I grant the private interview, sir, at your convenience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet went up to General Goodwin. My father talked to me, and lost a
      moment in shaking Temple&rsquo;s hand and saying kind things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Name any hour you please, Mr. Beltham,&rsquo; he resumed; &lsquo;meantime, I shall be
      glad to effect the introduction between Harry&rsquo;s grandfather and his
      Highness Prince Ernest of Eppenwelzen-Sarkeld.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned. General Goodwin was hurrying the prince up the steps, the
      squire at the same time retreating hastily. I witnessed the spectacle of
      both parties to the projected introduction swinging round to make their
      escape. My father glanced to right and left. He covered in the airiest
      fashion what would have been confusion to another by carrying on a jocose
      remark that he had left half spoken to Temple, and involved Janet in it,
      and soon&mdash;through sheer amiable volubility and his taking manner&mdash;the
      squire himself for a minute or so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harry, I have to tell you she is not unhappy,&rsquo; Janet whispered rapidly.
      &lsquo;She is reading of one of our great men alive now. She is glad to be on
      our ground.&rsquo; Janet named a famous admiral, kindling as a fiery beacon to
      our blood. She would have said more: she looked the remainder; but she
      could have said nothing better fitted to spur me to the work she wanted
      done. Mournfulness dropped on me like a cloud in thinking of the bright
      little princess of my boyhood, and the Ottilia of to-day, faithful to her
      early passion for our sea-heroes and my country, though it had grievously
      entrapped her. And into what hands! Not into hands which could cast one
      ray of honour on a devoted head. The contrast between the sane service&mdash;giving
      men she admired, and the hopping skipping social meteor, weaver of webs,
      thrower of nets, who offered her his history for a nuptial acquisition,
      was ghastly, most discomforting. He seemed to have entangled us all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said that he had. He treated me now confessedly as a cipher. The
      prince, the princess, my grandfather, and me&mdash;he had gathered us
      together, he said. I heard from him that the prince, assisted by him in
      the part of an adviser, saw no way of cutting the knot but by a marriage.
      All were at hand for a settlement of the terms:&mdash;Providence and
      destiny were dragged in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s have no theatrical talk,&rsquo; I interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, Richie; the plainest English,&rsquo; he assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was on the pier, while he bowed and greeted passing figures. I dared
      not unlink my arm, for fear of further mischief. I got him to my rooms,
      and insisted on his dining there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dry bread will do,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      My anticipations of the nature of our wrestle were correct. But I had not
      expected him to venture on the assertion that the prince was for the
      marriage. He met me at every turn with this downright iteration. &lsquo;The
      prince consents: he knows his only chance is to yield. I have him fast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How?&rsquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How, Richie? Where is your perspicuity? I have him here. I loosen a
      thousand tongues on him. I&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, not on him; on the princess, you mean.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On him. The princess is the willing party; she and you are one. On him, I
      say. &lsquo;Tis but a threat: I hold it in terrorem. And by heaven, son Richie,
      it assures me I have not lived and fought for nothing. &ldquo;Now is the day and
      now is the hour.&rdquo; On your first birthday, my boy, I swore to marry you to
      one of the highest ladies upon earth: she was, as it turns out, then
      unborn. No matter: I keep my oath. Abandon it? pooh! you are&mdash;forgive
      me&mdash;silly. Pardon me for remarking it, you have not that dashing
      courage&mdash;never mind. The point is, I have my prince in his trap. We
      are perfectly polite, but I have him, and he acknowledges it; he shrugs:
      love has beaten him. Very well. And observe: I permit no
      squire-of-low-degree insinuations; none of that. The lady&mdash;all
      earthly blessings on her!&mdash;does not stoop to Harry Richmond. I have
      the announcement in the newspapers. I maintain it the fruit of a life of
      long and earnest endeavour, legitimately won, by heaven it is! and with
      the constituted authorities of my native land against me. Your grandad
      proposes formally for the princess to-morrow morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He maddened me. Merely to keep him silent I burst out in a flux of
      reproaches as torrent-like as his own could be; and all the time I was
      wondering whether it was true that a man who talked as he did, in his
      strain of florid flimsy, had actually done a practical thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of my vehemence was to brace him and make him sedately
      emphatic. He declared himself to have gained entire possession of the
      prince&rsquo;s mind. He repeated his positive intention to employ his power for
      my benefit. Never did power of earth or of hell seem darker to me than he
      at that moment, when solemnly declaiming that he was prepared to forfeit
      my respect and love, die sooner than &lsquo;yield his prince.&rsquo; He wore a new
      aspect, spoke briefly and pointedly, using the phrases of a determined
      man, and in voice and gesture signified that he had us all in a grasp of
      iron. The charge of his having plotted to bring it about he accepted with
      exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I admit,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I did not arrange to have Germany present for a
      witness besides England, but since he is here, I take advantage of the
      fact, and to-morrow you will see young Eckart down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I cried out, as much enraged at my feebleness to resist him, as in disgust
      of his unscrupulous tricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, you have not known me, Richie,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I pilot you into harbour,
      and all you can do is just the creaking of the vessel to me. You are in my
      hands. I pilot you. I have you the husband of the princess within the
      month. No other course is open to her. And I have the assurance that she
      loses nothing by it. She is yours, my son.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She will not be. You have wrecked my last chance. You cover me with
      dishonour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a youngster, Richie. &lsquo;Tis the wish of her heart. Probably while
      you and I are talking it over, the prince is confessing that he has no
      escape. He has not a loophole! She came to you; you take her. I am far
      from withholding my admiration of her behaviour; but there it is&mdash;she
      came. Not consent? She is a ruined woman if she refuses!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Through you, through you!&mdash;through my father!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you both gone mad?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Try to see this,&rsquo; I implored him. &lsquo;She will not be subjected by any
      threats. The very whisper of one will make her turn from me...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He interrupted. &lsquo;Totally the contrary. The prince acknowledges that you
      are master of her affections.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Consistently with her sense of honour and respect for us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me of her reputation, Richie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You pretend that you can damage it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretend? I pretend in the teeth of all concerned to establish her
      happiness and yours, and nothing human shall stop me. I have you grateful
      to me before your old dad lays his head on his last pillow. And that
      reminds me: I surrender my town house and furniture to you. Waddy has
      received the word. By the way, should you hear of a good doctor for
      heart-disease, tell me: I have my fears for the poor soul.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up, saying, &lsquo;Richie, I am not like Jorian, to whom a
      lodging-house dinner is no dinner, and an irreparable loss, but I must
      have air. I go forth on a stroll.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible for me to allow it. I stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were in the midst of a debate as to his right of personal freedom, upon
      the singularity of which he commented with sundry ejaculations, when
      Temple arrived and General Goodwin sent up his card. Temple and I left the
      general closeted with my father, and stood at the street-door. He had seen
      the princess, having at her request been taken to present his respects to
      her by Janet. How she looked, what she said, he was dull in describing; he
      thought her lively, though she was pale. She had mentioned my name,
      &lsquo;kindly,&rsquo; he observed. And he knew, or suspected, the General to be an
      emissary from the prince. But he could not understand the exact nature of
      the complication, and plagued me with a mixture of blunt inquiries and the
      delicate reserve proper to him so much that I had to look elsewhere for
      counsel and sympathy. Janet had told him everything; still he was plunged
      in wonder, tempting me to think the lawyer&rsquo;s mind of necessity bourgeois,
      for the value of a sentiment seemed to have no weight in his estimation of
      the case. Nor did he appear disinclined to excuse my father. Some of his
      remarks partly swayed me, in spite of my seeing that they were based on
      the supposition of an &lsquo;all for love&rsquo; adventure of a mad princess. They
      whispered a little hope, when I was adoring her passionately for being the
      reverse of whatever might have given hope a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Goodwin, followed by my father, came down and led me aside after I
      had warned Temple not to let my father elude him. The General was greatly
      ruffled. &lsquo;Clara tells me she can rely on you,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I am at the end
      of my arguments with that man, short of sending him to the lock-up. You
      will pardon me, Mr. Harry; I foresaw the scrapes in store for you, and
      advised you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You did, General,&rsquo; I confessed. &lsquo;Will you tell me what it is Prince
      Ernest is in dread of?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A pitiable scandal, sir; and if he took my recommendation, he would find
      instant means of punishing the man who dares to threaten him. You know
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I explained that I was aware of the threat, not of the degree of the
      prince&rsquo;s susceptibility; and asked him if he had seen the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have had the honour,&rsquo; he replied, stiffly. &lsquo;You gain nothing with her
      by this infamous proceeding.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I swallowed my anger, and said, &lsquo;Do you accuse me, General?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not accuse you,&rsquo; he returned, unbendingly. &lsquo;You chose your path some
      ten or twelve years ago, and you must take the consequences. I foresaw it;
      but this I will say, I did not credit the man with his infernal
      cleverness. If I speak to you at all, I must speak my mind. I thought him
      a mere buffoon and spendthrift, flying his bar-sinister story for the sake
      of distinction. He has schemed up to this point successfully: he has the
      prince in his toils. I would cut through them, as I have informed Prince
      Ernest. I daresay different positions lead to different reasonings; the
      fellow appears to have a fascination over him. Your father, Mr. Harry, is
      guilty now&mdash;he is guilty, I reiterate, now of a piece of iniquity
      that makes me ashamed to own him for a countryman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The General shook himself erect. &lsquo;Are you unable to keep him in?&rsquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      My nerves were pricking and stinging with the insults I had to listen to,
      and conscience&rsquo;s justification of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He repeated the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will do what I can,&rsquo; I said, unsatisfactorily to myself and to him, for
      he transposed our situations, telling me the things he would say and do in
      my place; things not dissimilar to those I had already said and done, only
      more toweringly enunciated; and for that reason they struck me as all the
      more hopelessly ineffectual, and made me despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dumbness excited his ire. &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;the lady is a spoilt child.
      She behaved foolishly; but from your point of view you should feel bound
      to protect her on that very account. Do your duty, young gentleman. He is,
      I believe, fond of you, and if so, you have him by a chain. I tell you
      frankly, I hold you responsible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His way of speaking of the princess opened an idea of the world&rsquo;s, in the
      event of her name falling into its clutches.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said again, &lsquo;I will do what I can,&rsquo; and sang out for Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was alone. My father had slipped from him to leave a card at the
      squire&rsquo;s hotel. General Goodwin touched Temple on the shoulder kindly, in
      marked contrast to his treatment of me, and wished us good-night. Nothing
      had been heard of my father by Janet, but while I was sitting with her, at
      a late hour, his card was brought up, and a pencilled entreaty for an
      interview the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That will suit grandada,&rsquo; Janet said. &lsquo;He commissioned me before going to
      bed to write the same for him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She related that the prince was in a state of undisguised distraction.
      From what I could comprehend&mdash;it appeared incredible&mdash;he
      regarded his daughter&rsquo;s marriage as the solution of the difficulty, the
      sole way out of the meshes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is not that her wish?&rsquo; said Temple; perhaps with a wish of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, if you think a lady like the Princess Ottilia is led by her wishes,&rsquo; 
      said Janet. Her radiant perception of an ideal in her sex (the first she
      ever had) made her utterly contemptuous toward the less enlightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      We appointed the next morning at half-past eleven for my father&rsquo;s visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a minute later,&rsquo; Janet said in my ear, urgently. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      let him move out of your sight, Harry! The princess is convinced you are
      not to blame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked her whether she had any knowledge of the squire&rsquo;s designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not, on my honour,&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;But I hope... It is so
      miserable to think of this disgraceful thing! She is too firm to give way.
      She does not blame you. I am sure I do not; only, Harry, one always feels
      that if one were in another&rsquo;s place, in a case like this, I could and
      would command him. I would have him obey me. One is not born to accept
      disgrace even from a father. I should say, &ldquo;You shall not stir, if you
      mean to act dishonourably.&rdquo; One is justified, I am sure, in breaking a tie
      of relationship that involves you in dishonour. Grandada has not spoken a
      word to me on the subject. I catch at straws. This thing burns me! Oh,
      good-night, Harry. I can&rsquo;t sleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-night,&rsquo; she called softly to Temple on the stairs below. I heard the
      poor fellow murmuring good-night to himself in the street, and thought him
      happier than I. He slept at a room close to the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      A note from Clara Goodwin adjured me, by her memory of the sweet, brave,
      gracious fellow she loved in other days, to be worthy of what I had been.
      The General had unnerved her reliance on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat up for my father until long past midnight. When he came his
      appearance reminded me of the time of his altercation with Baroness
      Turckems under the light of the blazing curtains: he had supped and drunk
      deeply, and he very soon proclaimed that I should find him invincible,
      which, as far as insensibility to the strongest appeals to him went, he
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Deny you love her, deny she loves you, deny you are one&mdash;I knot you
      fast!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had again seen Prince Ernest; so he said, declaring that the Prince
      positively desired the marriage; would have it. &lsquo;And I,&rsquo; he dramatized
      their relative situations, &lsquo;consented.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After my experience of that night, I forgive men who are unmoved by
      displays of humour. Commonly we think it should be irresistible. His
      description of the thin-skinned sensitive prince striving to run and dodge
      for shelter from him, like a fever-patient pursued by a North-easter,
      accompanied by dozens of quaint similes full of his mental laughter, made
      my loathing all the more acute. But I had not been an equal match for him
      previous to his taking wine; it was waste of breath and heart to contend
      with him. I folded my arms tight, sitting rigidly silent, and he dropped
      on the sofa luxuriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bed, Richie!&rsquo; he waved to me. &lsquo;You drink no wine, you cannot stand
      dissipation as I do. Bed, my dear boy! I am a God, sir, inaccessible to
      mortal ailments! Seriously, dear boy, I have never known an illness in my
      life. I have killed my hundreds of poor devils who were for imitating me.
      This I boast&mdash;I boast constitution. And I fear, Richie, you have none
      of my superhuman strength. Added to that, I know I am watched over. I ask&mdash;I
      have: I scheme the tricks are in my hand! It may be the doing of my mother
      in heaven; there is the fact for you to reflect on. &ldquo;Stand not in my way,
      nor follow me too far,&rdquo; would serve me for a motto admirably, and you can
      put it in Latin, Richie. Bed! You shall turn your scholarship to account
      as I do my genius in your interest. On my soul, that motto in Latin will
      requite me. Now to bed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;You have got away from me once. I shall keep you in sight
      and hearing, if I have to lie at your door for it. You will go with me to
      London to-morrow. I shall treat you as a man I have to guard, and I shall
      not let you loose before I am quite sure of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Loose!&rsquo; he exclaimed, throwing up an arm and a leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean, sir, that you shall be in my presence wherever you are, and I
      will take care you don&rsquo;t go far and wide. It&rsquo;s useless to pretend
      astonishment. I don&rsquo;t argue and I don&rsquo;t beseech any further: I just sit on
      guard, as I would over a powder-cask.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father raised himself on an elbow. &lsquo;The explosion,&rsquo; he said, examining
      his watch, &lsquo;occurred at about five minutes to eleven&mdash;we are
      advancing into the morning&mdash;last night. I received on your behalf the
      congratulations of friends Loftus, Alton, Segrave, and the rest, at that
      hour. So, my dear Richie, you are sitting on guard over the empty
      magazine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I listened with a throbbing forehead, and controlled the choking in my
      throat, to ask him whether he had touched the newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, dear lad, I have sprung my mine in them,&rsquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have sent word&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have despatched a paragraph to the effect, that the prince and princess
      have arrived to ratify the nuptial preliminaries.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You expect it to appear this day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or else my name and influence are curiously at variance with the
      confidence I repose in them, Richie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I leave you to yourself,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Prince Ernest knows he has to
      expect this statement in the papers?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We trumped him with that identical court-card, Richie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well. To-morrow, after we have been to my grandfather, you and I
      part company for good, sir. It costs me too much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear old Richie,&rsquo; he laughed, gently. &lsquo;And now to bye-bye! My blessing on
      you now and always.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shut his eyes.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LI. AN ENCOUNTER SHOWING MY FATHER&rsquo;S GENIUS IN A STRONG LIGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The morning was sultry with the first rising of the sun. I knew that
      Ottilia and Janet would be out. For myself, I dared not leave the house. I
      sat in my room, harried by the most penetrating snore which can ever have
      afflicted wakeful ears. It proclaimed so deep-seated a peacefulness in the
      bosom of the disturber, and was so arrogant, so ludicrous, and
      inaccessible to remonstrance, that it sounded like a renewal of our
      midnight altercation on the sleeper&rsquo;s part. Prolonged now and then beyond
      all bounds, it ended in the crashing blare whereof utter wakefulness
      cannot imagine honest sleep to be capable, but a playful melody twirled
      back to the regular note. He was fast asleep on the sitting-room sofa,
      while I walked fretting and panting. To this twinship I seemed condemned.
      In my heart nevertheless there was a reserve of wonderment at his apparent
      astuteness and resolution, and my old love for him whispered disbelief in
      his having disgraced me. Perhaps it was wilful self-deception. It helped
      me to meet him with a better face.
    </p>
    <p>
      We both avoided the subject of our difference for some time: he would
      evidently have done so altogether, and used his best and sweetest manner
      to divert me: but when I struck on it, asking him if he had indeed told me
      the truth last night, his features clouded as though with an effort of
      patience. To my consternation, he suddenly broke away, with his arms up,
      puffing and stammering, stamping his feet. He would have a truce&mdash;he
      insisted on a truce, I understood him to exclaim, and that I was like a
      woman, who would and would not, and wanted a master. He raved of the
      gallant down-rightedness of the young bloods of his day, and how
      splendidly this one and that had compassed their ends by winning great
      ladies, lawfully, or otherwise. For several minutes he was in a state of
      frenzy, appealing to his pattern youths of a bygone generation, as to
      moral principles&mdash;stuttering, and of a dark red hue from the neck to
      the temples. I refrained from a scuffle of tongues. Nor did he excuse
      himself after he had cooled. His hand touched instinctively for his pulse,
      and, with a glance at the ceiling, he exclaimed, &lsquo;Good Lord!&rsquo; and brought
      me to his side. &lsquo;These wigwam houses check my circulation,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Let
      us go out-let us breakfast on board.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The open air restored him, and he told me that he had been merely
      oppressed by the architect of the inferior classes, whose ceiling sat on
      his head. My nerves, he remarked to me, were very exciteable. &lsquo;You should
      take your wine, Richie,&mdash;you require it. Your dear mother had a
      low-toned nervous system.&rsquo; I was silent, and followed him, at once a
      captive and a keeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      This day of slackened sails and a bright sleeping water kept the yachtsmen
      on land; there was a crowd to meet the morning boat. Foremost among those
      who stepped out of it was the yellow-haired Eckart, little suspecting what
      the sight of him signalled to me. I could scarcely greet him at all, for
      in him I perceived that my father had fully committed himself to his plot,
      and left me nothing to hope. Eckart said something of Prince Hermann. As
      we were walking off the pier, I saw Janet conversing with Prince Ernest,
      and the next minute Hermann himself was one of the group. I turned to
      Eckart for an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you he called at your house in London and travelled down
      with me this morning!&rsquo; said Eckart.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father looked in the direction of the princes, but his face was for the
      moment no index. They bowed to Janet, and began talking hurriedly in the
      triangle of road between her hotel, the pier, and the way to the villas:
      passing on, and coming to a full halt, like men who are not reserving
      their minds. My father stept out toward them. He was met by Prince Ernest.
      Hermann turned his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      It being the hour of the appointment, I delivered Eckart over to Temple&rsquo;s
      safe-keeping, and went up to Janet. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be late, Harry,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked her if she knew the object of the meeting appointed by my
      grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered impatiently, &lsquo;Do get him away from the prince.&rsquo; And then: &lsquo;I
      ought to tell you the princess is well, and so on&mdash;pardon me just
      now: Grandada is kept waiting, and I don&rsquo;t like it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her actual dislike was to see Prince Ernest in dialogue with my father, it
      seemed to me; and the manner of both, which was, one would have said,
      intimate, anything but the manner of adversaries. Prince Ernest appeared
      to affect a pleasant humour; he twice, after shaking my father&rsquo;s hand,
      stepped back to him, as if to renew some impression. Their attitude
      declared them to be on the best of terms. Janet withdrew her attentive
      eyes from observing them, and threw a world of meaning into her abstracted
      gaze at me. My father&rsquo;s advance put her to flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she gave him the welcome of a high-bred young woman when he entered
      the drawing-room of my grandfather&rsquo;s hotel-suite. She was alone, and she
      obliged herself to accept conversation graciously. He recommended her to
      try the German Baths for the squire&rsquo;s gout, and evidently amused her with
      his specific probations for English persons designing to travel in
      company, that they should previously live together in a house with a
      collection of undisciplined chambermaids, a musical footman, and a mad
      cook: to learn to accommodate their tempers. &lsquo;I would add a touch of
      earthquake, Miss Ilchester, just to make sure that all the party know one
      another&rsquo;s edges before starting.&rsquo; This was too far a shot of nonsense for
      Janet, whose native disposition was to refer to lunacy or stupidity, or
      trickery, whatsoever was novel to her understanding. &lsquo;I, for my part,&rsquo; 
      said he, &lsquo;stipulate to have for comrade no man who fancies himself a born
      and stamped chieftain, no inveterate student of maps, and no dog with a
      turn for feeling himself pulled by the collar. And that reminds me you are
      amateur of dogs. Have you a Pomeranian boar-hound?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Janet; &lsquo;I have never even seen one&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That high.&rsquo; My father raised his hand flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bigger than our Newfoundlands!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Without exaggeration, big as a pony. You will permit me to send you one,
      warranted to have passed his distemper, which can rarely be done for our
      human species, though here and there I venture to guarantee my man as well
      as my dog.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet interposed her thanks, declining to take the dog, but he dwelt on
      the dog&rsquo;s charms, his youth, stature, appearance, fitness, and grandeur,
      earnestly. I had to relieve her apprehensions by questioning where the dog
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In Germany,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not improbable, nor less so that the dog was in Pomerania likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entry of my aunt Dorothy, followed by my grandfather, was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be seated,&rsquo; the old man addressed us in a body, to cut short particular
      salutations.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father overshadowed him with drooping shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet wished to know whether she was to remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I like you by me always,&rsquo; he answered, bluff and sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have some shopping to do,&rsquo; my aunt Dorothy murmured, showing she was
      there against her will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you shop out of London?&rsquo; said my father; and for some time he
      succeeded in making us sit for the delusive picture of a comfortable
      family meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather sat quite still, Janet next to him. &lsquo;When you&rsquo;ve finished,
      Mr. Richmond,&rsquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Beltham, I was telling Miss Beltham that I join in the abuse of
      London exactly because I love it. A paradox! she says. But we seem to be
      effecting a kind of insurance on the life of the things we love best by
      crying them down violently. You have observed it? Denounce them&mdash;they
      endure for ever! So I join any soul on earth in decrying our dear London.
      The naughty old City can bear it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a clearing of throats. My aunt Dorothy&rsquo;s foot tapped the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I presume you have done me the honour to invite me to this conference
      on a point of business, Mr. Beltham?&rsquo; said my father, admonished by the
      hint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have, sir,&rsquo; the squire replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I also have a point. And, in fact, it is urgent, and with your
      permission, Mr. Beltham, I will lead the way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir, if you please.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;m a short speaker, and go to it at once, and I won&rsquo;t detain you a second
      after you&rsquo;ve answered me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father nodded to this, with the conciliatory comment that it was
      business-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man drew out his pocket-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You paid a debt,&rsquo; he said deliberately, &lsquo;amounting to twenty-one thousand
      pounds to my grandson&rsquo;s account.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! a debt! I did, sir. Between father and boy, dad and lad; debts! ...
      but use your own terms, I pray you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t ask you where that money is now. I ask you to tell me where you
      got it from.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You speak bluntly, my dear sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t answer, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ask the question as a family matter? I reply with alacrity, to the
      best of my ability: and with my hand on my heart, Mr. Beltham, let me
      assure you, I very heartily desire the information to be furnished to me.
      Or rather&mdash;why should I conceal it? The sources are irregular, but a
      child could toddle its way to them&mdash;you take my indication. Say that
      I obtained it from my friends. My friends, Mr. Beltham, are of the kind
      requiring squeezing. Government, as my chum and good comrade, Jorian
      DeWitt, is fond of saying, is a sponge&mdash;a thing that when you dive
      deep enough to catch it gives liberal supplies, but will assuredly
      otherwise reverse the process by acting the part of an absorbent. I get
      what I get by force of arms, or I might have perished long since.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know where you got it from, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Technically, you are correct, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A bird didn&rsquo;t bring it, and you didn&rsquo;t find it in the belly of a fish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Neither of these prodigies. They have occurred in books I am bound to
      believe; they did not happen to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You swear to me you don&rsquo;t know the man, woman, or committee, who gave you
      that sum?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not know, Mr. Beltham. In an extraordinary history, extraordinary
      circumstances! I have experienced so many that I am surprised at nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You suppose you got it from some fool?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! if you choose to indict Government collectively?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You pretend you got it from Government?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am termed a Pretender by some, Mr. Beltham. The facts are these: I
      promised to refund the money, and I fulfilled the promise. There you have
      the only answer I can make to you. Now to my own affair. I come to request
      you to demand the hand of the Princess of Eppenwelzen-Sarkeld on behalf of
      my son Harry, your grandson; and I possess the assurance of the prince,
      her father, that it will be granted. Doubtless you, sir, are of as old a
      blood as the prince himself. You will acknowledge that the honour brought
      to the family by an hereditary princess is considerable: it is something.
      I am prepared to accompany you to his Highness, or not, as you please. It
      is but a question of dotation, and a selection from one or two
      monosyllables.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet shook her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire replied: &lsquo;We &lsquo;ll take that up presently. I haven&rsquo;t quite done.
      Will you tell me what agent paid you the sum of money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The usual agent&mdash;a solicitor, Mr. Beltham; a gentleman whose
      business lay amongst the aristocracy; he is defunct; and a very worthy old
      gentleman he was, with a remarkable store of anecdotes of his patrons,
      very discreetly told: for you never heard a name from him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You took him for an agent of Government, did you? why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To condense a long story, sir, the kernel of the matter is, that almost
      from the hour I began to stir for the purpose of claiming my rights&mdash;which
      are transparent enough this old gentleman&mdash;certainly from no sinister
      motive, I may presume&mdash;commenced the payment of an annuity; not
      sufficient for my necessities, possibly, but warrant of an agreeable sort
      for encouraging my expectations; although oddly, this excellent old Mr.
      Bannerbridge invariably served up the dish in a sauce that did not agree
      with it, by advising me of the wish of the donator that I should abandon
      my Case. I consequently, in common with my friends, performed a little
      early lesson in arithmetic, and we came to the one conclusion open to
      reflective minds&mdash;namely, that I was feared.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt Dorothy looked up for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Janet and I have some purchases to make,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire signified sharply that she must remain where she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think aunty wants fresh air; she had a headache last night,&rsquo; said
      Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suggested that, as my presence did not seem to be required, I could take
      her on my arm for a walk to the pier-head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was burning; she would gladly have gone out, but the squire
      refused to permit it, and she nodded over her crossed hands, saying that
      she was in no hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! I am,&rsquo; quoth he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Miss Beltham!&rsquo; my father ejaculated solicitously. &lsquo;Here, sir, oblige
      me by attending to me,&rsquo; cried the squire, fuming and blinking. &lsquo;I sent for
      you on a piece of business. You got this money through a gentleman, a
      solicitor, named Bannerbridge, did you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His name was Bannerbridge, Mr. Beltham.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dorothy, you knew a Mr. Bannerbridge?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She faltered: &lsquo;I knew him.... Harry was lost in the streets of London when
      he was a little fellow, and the Mr. Bannerbridge I knew found him and took
      him to his house, and was very kind to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What was his Christian name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave them: &lsquo;Charles Adolphus.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The identical person!&rsquo; exclaimed my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! you admit it,&rsquo; said the squire. &lsquo;Ever seen him since the time Harry
      was lost, Dorothy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;I have heard he is dead:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you see him shortly before his death?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I happened to see him a short time before!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was your man of business, was he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For such little business as I had to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were sure you could trust him, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt Dorothy breathed deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By God, ma&rsquo;am, you&rsquo;re a truthful woman!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man gave her a glare of admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now my turn to undergo examination, and summoned by his apostrophe
      to meet his eyes, I could appreciate the hardness of the head I had to
      deal with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harry, I beg your pardon beforehand; I want to get at facts; I must ask
      you what you know about where the money came from?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I spoke of my attempts to discover the whence and wherefore of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Government? eh?&rsquo; he sneered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I really can&rsquo;t judge whether it came from that quarter,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think?&mdash;think it likely?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought it unlikely, and yet likelier than that it should have come from
      an individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you don&rsquo;t suspect any particular person of having sent it in the
      nick of time, Harry Richmond?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I replied: &lsquo;No, sir; unless you force me to suspect you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He jumped in his chair, astounded and wrathful, confounded me for
      insinuating that he was a Bedlamite, and demanded the impudent reason of
      my suspecting him to have been guilty of the infernal folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had but the reason to instance that he was rich and kind at heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rich! kind!&rsquo; he bellowed. &lsquo;Just excuse me&mdash;I must ask for the
      purpose of my inquiry;&mdash;there, tell me, how much do you believe you
      &lsquo;ve got of that money remaining? None o&rsquo; that Peterborough style of
      counting in the back of your pate. Say!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a dreadful silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father leaned persuasively forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Beltham, I crave permission to take up the word. Allow me to remind
      you of the prize Harry has won. The prince awaits you to bestow on him the
      hand of his daughter&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Out with it, Harry,&rsquo; shouted the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not to mention Harry&rsquo;s seat in Parliament,&rsquo; my father resumed, &lsquo;he has a
      princess to wife, indubitably one of the most enviable positions in the
      country! It is unnecessary to count on future honours; they may be alluded
      to. In truth, sir, we make him the first man in the country. Not
      necessarily Premier: you take my meaning: he possesses the combination of
      social influence and standing with political achievements, and rank and
      riches in addition&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I &lsquo;m speaking to my grandson, sir,&rsquo; the squire rejoined, shaking himself
      like a man rained on. &lsquo;I &lsquo;m waiting for a plain answer, and no lie. You&rsquo;ve
      already confessed as much as that the money you told me on your honour you
      put out to interest; psh!&mdash;for my grandson was smoke. Now let&rsquo;s hear
      him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father called out: &lsquo;I claim a hearing! The money you speak of was put
      out to the very highest interest. You have your grandson in Parliament,
      largely acquainted with the principal members of society, husband of an
      hereditary princess! You have only at this moment to propose for her hand.
      I guarantee it to you. With that money I have won him everything. Not that
      I would intimate to you that princesses are purchaseable. The point is, I
      knew how to employ it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In two months&rsquo; time, the money in the Funds in the boy&rsquo;s name&mdash;you
      told me that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had it in the Funds in Harry Richmond&rsquo;s name, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir, I&rsquo;m asking him whether it&rsquo;s in the Funds now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Mr. Beltham.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What answer&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire was really confused by my father&rsquo;s interruption, and lost sight
      of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ask where it came from: I ask whether it&rsquo;s squandered?&rsquo; he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Beltham, I reply that you have only to ask for it to have it; do so
      immediately.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What &lsquo;s he saying?&rsquo; cried the baffled old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I give you a thousand times the equivalent of the money, Mr. Beltham.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is the money there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The lady is here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I said money, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A priceless honour and treasure, I say emphatically.&rsquo; My grandfather&rsquo;s
      brows and mouth were gathering for storm. Janet touched his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where the devil your understanding truckles, if you have any, I don&rsquo;t
      know,&rsquo; he muttered. &lsquo;What the deuce&mdash;lady got to do with money!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; my father laughed lightly, &lsquo;customarily the alliance is, they say,
      as close as matrimony. Pardon me. To speak with becoming seriousness, Mr.
      Beltham, it was duly imperative that our son should be known in society,
      should be, you will apprehend me, advanced in station, which I had to do
      through the ordinary political channel. There could not but be a
      considerable expenditure for such a purpose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In Balls, and dinners!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In everything that builds a young gentleman&rsquo;s repute.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You swear to me you gave your Balls and dinners, and the lot, for Harry
      Richmond&rsquo;s sake?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On my veracity, I did, sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t talk like a mountebank. I don&rsquo;t want any of your roundabout
      words for truth; we&rsquo;re not writing a Bible essay. I try my best to be
      civil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father beamed on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I guarantee you succeed, sir. Nothing on earth can a man be so absolutely
      sure of as to succeed in civility, if he honestly tries at it. Jorian
      DeWitt,&mdash;by the way, you may not know him&mdash;an esteemed old
      friend of mine, says&mdash;that is, he said once&mdash;to a tolerably
      impudent fellow whom he had disconcerted with a capital retort, &ldquo;You may
      try to be a gentleman, and blunder at it, but if you will only try to be
      his humble servant, we are certain to establish a common footing.&rdquo; Jorian,
      let me tell you, is a wit worthy of our glorious old days.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather eased his heart with a plunging breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir, I didn&rsquo;t ask you here for your opinion or your friend&rsquo;s, and I
      don&rsquo;t care for modern wit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor I, Mr. Beltham, nor I! It has the reek of stable straw. We are of one
      mind on that subject. The thing slouches, it sprawls. It&mdash;to quote
      Jorian once more&mdash;is like a dirty, idle, little stupid boy who cannot
      learn his lesson and plays the fool with the alphabet. You smile, Miss
      Ilchester: you would appreciate Jorian. Modern wit is emphatically
      degenerate. It has no scintillation, neither thrust nor parry. I compare
      it to boxing, as opposed to the more beautiful science of fencing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir, I don&rsquo;t want to hear your comparisons,&rsquo; growled the squire,
      much oppressed. &lsquo;Stop a minute...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Half a minute to me, sir,&rsquo; said my father, with a glowing reminiscence of
      Jorian DeWitt, which was almost too much for the combustible old man, even
      under Janet&rsquo;s admonition.
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt Dorothy moved her head slightly toward my father, looking on the
      floor, and he at once drew in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Beltham, I attend to you submissively.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do? Then tell me what brought this princess to England?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The conviction that Harry had accomplished his oath to mount to an
      eminence in his country, and had made the step she is about to take less,
      I will say, precipitous: though I personally decline to admit a pointed
      inferiority.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wrote her a letter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That, containing the news of the attack on him and his desperate illness,
      was the finishing touch to the noble lady&rsquo;s passion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Attack? I know nothing about an attack. You wrote her a letter and wrote
      her a lie. You said he was dying.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had the boy inanimate on my breast when I despatched the epistle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You said he had only a few days to live.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So in my affliction I feared.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you swear you didn&rsquo;t write that letter with the intention of drawing
      her over here to have her in your power, so that you might threaten you&rsquo;d
      blow on her reputation if she or her father held out against you and all
      didn&rsquo;t go as you fished for it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father raised his head proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I divide your query into two parts. I wrote, sir, to bring her to his
      side. I did not write with any intention to threaten.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve done it, though.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have done this,&rsquo; said my father, toweringly: &lsquo;I have used the power
      placed in my hands by Providence to overcome the hesitations of a
      gentleman whose illustrious rank predisposes him to sacrifice his
      daughter&rsquo;s happiness to his pride of birth and station. Can any one
      confute me when I assert that the princess loves Harry Richmond?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked abruptly to one of the windows, hearing a pitiable wrangling on
      the theme. My grandfather vowed she had grown wiser, my father protested
      that she was willing and anxious; Janet was appealed to. In a
      strangely-sounding underbreath, she said, &lsquo;The princess does not wish it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You hear that, Mr. Richmond?&rsquo; cried the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned: &lsquo;Can Miss Ilchester say that the Princess Ottilia does not
      passionately love my son Harry Richmond? The circumstances warrant me in
      beseeching a direct answer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She uttered: &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her; she at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can conduct a case, Richmond,&rsquo; the squire remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father rose to his feet. &lsquo;I can conduct my son to happiness and
      greatness, my dear sir; but to some extent I require your grandfatherly
      assistance; and I urge you now to present your respects to the prince and
      princess, and judge yourself of his Highness&rsquo;s disposition for the match.
      I assure you in advance that he welcomes the proposal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not believe it,&rsquo; said Janet, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt Dorothy followed her example, saying: &lsquo;In justice to Harry the
      proposal should be made. At least it will settle this dispute.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet stared at her, and the squire threw his head back with an amazed
      interjection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! You&rsquo;re for it now? Why, at breakfast you were all t&rsquo; other way! You
      didn&rsquo;t want this meeting because you pooh-poohed the match.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do think you should go,&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;You have given Harry your
      promise, and if he empowers you, it is right to make the proposal, and
      immediately, I think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke feverishly, with an unsweet expression of face, that seemed to
      me to indicate vexedness at the squire&rsquo;s treatment of my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harry,&rsquo; she asked me in a very earnest fashion, &lsquo;is it your desire? Tell
      your grandfather that it is, and that you want to know your fate. Why
      should there be any dispute on a fact that can be ascertained by crossing
      a street? Surely it is trifling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet stooped to whisper in the squire&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught the shock of unexpected intelligence apparently; faced about,
      gazed up, and cried: &lsquo;You too! But I haven&rsquo;t done here. I &lsquo;ve got to
      cross-examine... Pretend, do you mean? Pretend I&rsquo;m ready to go? I can
      release this prince just as well here as there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet laughed faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should advise your going, grandada.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You a weathercock woman!&rsquo; he reproached her, quite mystified, and fell to
      rubbing his head. &lsquo;Suppose I go to be snubbed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The prince is a gentleman, grandada. Come with me. We will go alone. You
      can relieve the prince, and protect him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father nodded: &lsquo;I approve.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And grandada&mdash;but it will not so much matter if we are alone,
      though,&rsquo; Janet said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See the princess as well; she must be present.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I leave it to you,&rsquo; he said, crestfallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet pressed my aunt Dorothy&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aunty, you were right, you are always right. This state of suspense is
      bad all round, and it is infinitely worse for the prince and princess.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt Dorothy accepted the eulogy with a singular trembling wrinkle of
      the forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      She evidently understood that Janet had seen her wish to get released.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my part, I shared my grandfather&rsquo;s stupefaction at their unaccountable
      changes. It appeared almost as if my father had won them over to baffle
      him. The old man tried to insist on their sitting down again, but Janet
      perseveringly smiled and smiled until he stood up. She spoke to him
      softly. He was one black frown; displeased with her; obedient, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too soon after, I had the key to the enigmatical scene. At the moment I
      was contemptuous of riddles, and heard with idle ears Janet&rsquo;s promptings
      to him and his replies. &lsquo;It would be so much better to settle it here,&rsquo; he
      said. She urged that it could not be settled here without the whole burden
      and responsibility falling upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly,&rsquo; interposed my father, triumphing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy Beltham came to my side, and said, as if speaking to herself,
      while she gazed out of window, &lsquo;If a refusal, it should come from the
      prince.&rsquo; She dropped her voice: &lsquo;The money has not been spent? Has it? Has
      any part of it been spent? Are you sure you have more than three parts of
      it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, that she should be possessed by the spirit of parsimony on my behalf
      at such a time as this, was to my conception insanely comical, and her
      manner of expressing it was too much for me. I kept my laughter under to
      hear her continue: &lsquo;What numbers are flocking on the pier! and there is no
      music yet. Tell me, Harry, that the money is all safe; nearly all; it is
      important to know; you promised economy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Music did you speak of, Miss Beltham?&rsquo; My father bowed to her gallantly.
      &lsquo;I chanced to overhear you. My private band performs to the public at
      midday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was obliged to smile to excuse his interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that? whose band?&rsquo; said the squire, bursting out of Janet&rsquo;s hand.
      &lsquo;A private band?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet had a difficulty in resuming her command of him. The mention of the
      private band made him very restive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I &lsquo;m not acting on my own judgement at all in going to these foreign
      people,&rsquo; he said to Janet. &lsquo;Why go? I can have it out here and an end to
      it, without bothering them and their interpreters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He sang out to me: &lsquo;Harry, do you want me to go through this form for you?&mdash;mn&rsquo;d
      unpleasant!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt Dorothy whispered in my ear: &lsquo;Yes! yes!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feel tricked!&rsquo; he muttered, and did not wait for me to reply before he
      was again questioning my aunt Dorothy concerning Mr. Bannerbridge, and my
      father as to &lsquo;that sum of money.&rsquo; But his method of interrogation was
      confused and pointless. The drift of it was totally obscure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m off my head to-day,&rsquo; he said to Janet, with a sideshot of his eye at
      my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You waste time and trouble, grandada,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      He vowed that he was being bewildered, bothered by us all; and I thought I
      had never seen him so far below his level of energy; but I had not seen
      him condescend to put himself upon a moderately fair footing with my
      father. The truth was, that Janet had rigorously schooled him to bridle
      his temper, and he was no match for the voluble easy man without the
      freest play of his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This prince!&rsquo; he kept ejaculating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you understand, grandada, that you relieve him, and make things
      clear by going?&rsquo; Janet said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He begged her fretfully not to be impatient, and hinted that she and he
      might be acting the part of dupes, and was for pursuing his inauspicious
      cross-examination in spite of his blundering, and the &lsquo;Where am I now?&rsquo; 
      which pulled him up. My father, either talking to my aunt Dorothy, to
      Janet, or to me, on ephemeral topics, scarcely noticed him, except when he
      was questioned, and looked secure of success in the highest degree
      consistent with perfect calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you say you tell me to go, do you?&rsquo; the squire called to me. &lsquo;Be good
      enough to stay here and wait. I don&rsquo;t see that anything&rsquo;s gained by my
      going: it&rsquo;s damned hard on me, having to go to a man whose language I
      don&rsquo;t know, and he don&rsquo;t know mine, on a business we&rsquo;re all of us in a
      muddle about. I&rsquo;ll do it if it&rsquo;s right. You&rsquo;re sure?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at Janet. She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was looking for this quaint and, to me, incomprehensible interlude to
      commence with the departure of the squire and Janet, when a card was
      handed in by one of the hotel-waiters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another prince!&rsquo; cried the squire. &lsquo;These Germans seem to grow princes
      like potatoes&mdash;dozens to a root! Who&rsquo;s the card for? Ask him to walk
      up. Show him into a quiet room. Does he speak English?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does Prince Hermann of&mdash;I can&rsquo;t pronounce the name of the place&mdash;speak
      English, Harry?&rsquo; Janet asked me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As well as you or I,&rsquo; said I, losing my inattention all at once with a
      mad leap of the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermann&rsquo;s presence gave light, fire, and colour to the scene in which my
      destiny had been wavering from hand to hand without much more than
      amusedly interesting me, for I was sure that I had lost Ottilia; I knew
      that too well, and worse could not happen. I had besides lost other things
      that used to sustain me, and being reckless, I was contemptuous, and
      listened to the talk about money with sublime indifference to the subject:
      with an attitude, too, I daresay. But Hermann&rsquo;s name revived my torment.
      Why had he come? to persuade the squire to control my father? Nothing but
      that would suffer itself to be suggested, though conjectures lying in
      shadow underneath pressed ominously on my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father had no doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A word to you, Mr. Beltham, before you go to Prince Hermann. He is an
      emissary, we treat him with courtesy, and if he comes to diplomatize we,
      of course, give a patient hearing. I have only to observe in the most
      emphatic manner possible that I do not retract one step. I will have this
      marriage: I have spoken! It rests with Prince Ernest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire threw a hasty glare of his eyes back as he was hobbling on
      Janet&rsquo;s arm. She stopped short, and replied for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Beltham will speak for himself, in his own name. We are not concerned
      in any unworthy treatment of Prince Ernest. We protest against it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear young lady!&rsquo; said my father, graciously. &lsquo;I meet you frankly. Now
      tell me. I know you a gallant horsewoman: if you had lassoed the noble
      horse of the desert would you let him run loose because of his
      remonstrating? Side with me, I entreat you! My son is my first thought.
      The pride of princes and wild horses you will find wonderfully similar,
      especially in the way they take their taming when once they feel they are
      positively caught. We show him we have him fast&mdash;he falls into our
      paces on the spot! For Harry&rsquo;s sake&mdash;for the princess&rsquo;s, I beg you
      exert your universally&mdash;deservedly acknowledged influence. Even now&mdash;and
      you frown on me!&mdash;I cannot find it in my heart to wish you the sweet
      and admirable woman of the world you are destined to be, though you would
      comprehend me and applaud me, for I could not&mdash;no, not to win your
      favourable opinion!&mdash;consent that you should be robbed of a single
      ray of your fresh maidenly youth. If you must misjudge me, I submit. It is
      the price I pay for seeing you young and lovely. Prince Ernest is, credit
      me, not unworthily treated by me, if life is a battle, and the prize of it
      to the General&rsquo;s head. I implore you&rsquo;&mdash;he lured her with the dimple
      of a lurking smile&mdash;&lsquo;do not seriously blame your afflicted senior, if
      we are to differ. I am vastly your elder: you instil the doubt whether I
      am by as much the wiser of the two; but the father of Harry Richmond
      claims to know best what will ensure his boy&rsquo;s felicity. Is he rash?
      Pronounce me guilty of an excessive anxiety for my son&rsquo;s welfare; say that
      I am too old to read the world with the accuracy of a youthful
      intelligence: call me indiscreet: stigmatize me unlucky; the severest
      sentence a judge&rsquo;&mdash;he bowed to her deferentially&mdash;&lsquo;can utter;
      only do not cast a gaze of rebuke on me because my labour is for my son&mdash;my
      utmost devotion. And we know, Miss Ilchester, that the princess honours
      him with her love. I protest in all candour, I treat love as love; not as
      a weight in the scale; it is the heavenly power which dispenses with
      weighing! its ascendancy...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire could endure no more, and happily so, for my father was losing
      his remarkably moderated tone, and threatening polysyllables. He had
      followed Janet, step for step, at a measured distance, drooping toward her
      with his winningest air, while the old man pulled at her arm to get her
      out of hearing of the obnoxious flatterer. She kept her long head in
      profile, trying creditably not to appear discourteous to one who addressed
      her by showing an open ear, until the final bolt made by the frenzied old
      man dragged her through the doorway. His neck was shortened behind his
      collar as though he shrugged from the blast of a bad wind. I believe that,
      on the whole, Janet was pleased. I will wager that, left to herself, she
      would have been drawn into an answer, if not an argument. Nothing would
      have made her resolution swerve, I admit.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not been out of the room three seconds when my aunt Dorothy was
      called to join them. She had found time to say that she hoped the money
      was intact.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LII. STRANGE REVELATIONS, AND MY GRANDFATHER HAS HIS LAST OUTBURST
    </h2>
    <p>
      My father and I stood at different windows, observing the unconcerned
      people below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you scheme to bring Prince Hermann over here as well?&rsquo; I asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied laughing: &lsquo;I really am not the wonderful wizard you think me,
      Richie. I left Prince Ernest&rsquo;s address as mine with Waddy in case the Frau
      Feld-Marschall should take it into her head to come. Further than that you
      must question Providence, which I humbly thank for its unfailing support,
      down to unexpected trifles. Only this&mdash;to you and to all of them:
      nothing bends me. I will not be robbed of the fruit of a lifetime.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Supposing I refuse?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You refuse, Richie, to restore the princess her character and the prince
      his serenity of mind at their urgent supplication? I am utterly unable to
      suppose it. You are married in the papers this morning. I grieve to say
      that the position of Prince Hermann is supremely ridiculous. I am bound to
      add he is a bold boy. It requires courage in one of the pretenders to the
      hand of the princess to undertake the office of intercessor, for he must
      know&mdash;the man must know in his heart that he is doing her no
      kindness. He does not appeal to me, you see. I have shown that my
      arrangements are unalterable. What he will make of your grandad!... Why on
      earth he should have been sent to&mdash;of all men in the world&mdash;your
      grandad, Richie!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was invited to sympathetic smiles of shrewd amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught sight of friends, and threw up the window, saluting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire returned with my aunt Dorothy and Janet to behold the detested
      man communicating with the outer world from his own rooms. He shouted
      unceremoniously, &lsquo;Shut that window!&rsquo; and it was easy to see that he had
      come back heavily armed for the offensive. &lsquo;Here, Mr. Richmond, I don&rsquo;t
      want all men to know you&rsquo;re in my apartments.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I forgot, sir, temporarily,&rsquo; said my father, &lsquo;I had vacated the rooms for
      your convenience&mdash;be assured.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      An explanation on the subject of the rooms ensued between the old man and
      the ladies;&mdash;it did not improve his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sense of breeding, nevertheless, forced him to remark, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t thank
      you, sir, for putting me under an obligation I should never have incurred
      myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I was happy to be of use to the ladies, Mr. Beltham, and require no
      small coin of exchange,&rsquo; my father responded with the flourish of a
      pacifying hand. &lsquo;I have just heard from a posse of friends that the
      marriage is signalled in this morning&rsquo;s papers&mdash;numberless
      congratulations, I need not observe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said the squire. &lsquo;Nobody&rsquo;ll understand them here, and I
      needn&rsquo;t ask you to sit down, because I don&rsquo;t want you to stop. I&rsquo;ll soon
      have done now; the game&rsquo;s played. Here, Harry, quick; has all that money
      been spent&mdash;no offence to you, but as a matter of business?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not all, sir,&rsquo; I was able to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Half?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I think so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Three parts?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It may be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And liabilities besides?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are some.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not a liar. That&rsquo;ll do for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to my aunt: her eyes had shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dorothy, you&rsquo;ve sold out twenty-five thousand pounds&rsquo; worth of stock.
      You&rsquo;re a truthful woman, as I said, and so I won&rsquo;t treat you like a
      witness in a box. You gave it to Harry to help him out of his scrape. Why,
      short of staring lunacy, did you pass it through the hands of this man? He
      sweated his thousands out of it at the start. Why did you make a secret of
      it to make the man think his nonsense?&mdash;Ma&rsquo;am, behave like a lady and
      my daughter,&rsquo; he cried, fronting her, for the sudden and blunt attack had
      slackened her nerves; she moved as though to escape, and was bewildered. I
      stood overwhelmed. No wonder she had attempted to break up the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me your object, Dorothy Beltham, in passing the money through the
      hands of this man? Were you for helping him to be a man of his word? Help
      the boy&mdash;that I understand. However, you were mistress of your money!
      I&rsquo;ve no right to complain, if you will go spending a fortune to whitewash
      the blackamoor! Well, it&rsquo;s your own, you&rsquo;ll say. So it is: so &lsquo;s your
      character!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The egregious mildness of these interjections could not long be preserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You deceived me, ma&rsquo;am. You wouldn&rsquo;t build school-houses, you couldn&rsquo;t
      subscribe to Charities, you acted parsimony, to pamper a scamp and his
      young scholar! You went to London&mdash;you did it in cool blood; you went
      to your stockbroker, and from the stockbroker to the Bank, and you sold
      out stock to fling away this big sum. I went to the Bank on business, and
      the books were turned over for my name, and there at &ldquo;Beltham&rdquo; I saw quite
      by chance the cross of the pen, and I saw your folly, ma&rsquo;am; I saw it all
      in a shot. I went to the Bank on my own business, mind that. Ha! you know
      me by this time; I loathe spying; the thing jumped out of the book; I
      couldn&rsquo;t help seeing. Now I don&rsquo;t reckon how many positive fools go to
      make one superlative humbug; you&rsquo;re one of the lot, and I&rsquo;ve learnt it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father airily begged leave to say: &lsquo;As to positive and superlative, Mr.
      Beltham, the three degrees of comparison are no longer of service except
      to the trader. I do not consider them to exist for ladies. Your positive
      is always particularly open to dispute, and I venture to assert I cap you
      your superlative ten times over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked the stuff for a diversion, presenting in the midst of us an
      incongruous image of smiles that filled me with I knew not what feelings
      of angry alienation, until I was somewhat appeased by the idea that he had
      not apprehended the nature of the words just spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed incredible, yet it was true; it was proved to be so to me by his
      pricking his ears and his attentive look at the mention of the word
      prepossessing him in relation to the money: Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire said something of Government to my aunt Dorothy, with
      sarcastical emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the observation was unnecessary, and was wantonly thrown in by him, she
      seized on it to escape from her compromising silence: &lsquo;I know nothing of
      Government or its ways.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She murmured further, and looked at Janet, who came to her aid, saying:
      &lsquo;Grandada, we&rsquo;ve had enough talk of money, money! All is done that you
      wanted done. Stocks, Shares, Banks&mdash;we&rsquo;ve gone through them all.
      Please, finish! Please, do. You have only to state what you have heard
      from Prince Hermann.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet gazed in the direction of my father, carefully avoiding my eyes, but
      evidently anxious to shield my persecuted aunty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speaking of Stocks and Shares, Miss Ilchester,&rsquo; said my father, &lsquo;I myself
      would as soon think of walking into a field of scythe-blades in full
      activity as of dabbling in them. One of the few instances I remember of
      our Jorian stooping to a pun, is upon the contango: ingenious truly, but
      objectionable, because a pun. I shall not be guilty of repeating it. &ldquo;The
      stockmarket is the national snapdragon bowl,&rdquo; he says, and is very amusing
      upon the Jews; whether quite fairly, Mr. Beltham knows better than I, on
      my honour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He appealed lightly to the squire, for thus he danced on the crater&rsquo;s
      brink, and had for answer,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a cool scoundrel, Richmond.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I choose to respect you, rather in spite of yourself, I fear, sir,&rsquo; said
      my father, bracing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you hear my conversation with my daughter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I heard, if I may say so, the lion taking his share of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All roaring to you, was it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Beltham, we have our little peculiarities; I am accustomed to think
      of a steam-vent when I hear you indulging in a sentence of unusual length,
      and I hope it is for our good, as I thoroughly believe it is for yours,
      that you should deliver yourself freely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you tell me; like a stage lacquey!&rsquo; muttered the old man, with
      surprising art in caricaturing a weakness in my father&rsquo;s bearing, of which
      I was cruelly conscious, though his enunciation was flowing. He lost his
      naturalness through forcing for ease in the teeth of insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grandada, aunty and I will leave you,&rsquo; said Janet, waxing importunate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I&rsquo;ve done,&rsquo; said he, facing his victim savagely. &lsquo;The fellow
      pretends he didn&rsquo;t understand. She&rsquo;s here to corroborate. Richmond, there,
      my daughter, Dorothy Beltham, there&rsquo;s the last of your fools and dupes.
      She&rsquo;s a truthful woman, I&rsquo;ll own, and she&rsquo;ll contradict me if what I say
      is not the fact. That twenty-five thousand from &ldquo;Government&rdquo; came out of
      her estate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Out of&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Out of be damned, sir! She&rsquo;s the person who paid it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If the &ldquo;damns&rdquo; have set up, you may as well let the ladies go,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      He snapped at me like a rabid dog in career.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s the person&mdash;one of your petticoat &ldquo;Government&rdquo;&mdash;who paid&mdash;do
      you hear me, Richmond?&mdash;the money to help you to keep your word: to
      help you to give your Balls and dinners too. She&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say she
      told you, and you knew it&mdash;she paid it. She sent it through her Mr.
      Bannerbridge. Do you understand now? You had it from her. My God! look at
      the fellow!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A dreadful gape of stupefaction had usurped the smiles on my father&rsquo;s
      countenance; his eyes rolled over, he tried to articulate, and was indeed
      a spectacle for an enemy. His convulsed frame rocked the syllables, as
      with a groan, unpleasant to hear, he called on my aunt Dorothy by
      successive stammering apostrophes to explain, spreading his hands wide. He
      called out her Christian name. Her face was bloodless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Address my daughter respectfully, sir, will you! I won&rsquo;t have your
      infernal familiarities!&rsquo; roared the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is my brother-in-law,&rsquo; said Dorothy, reposing on the courage of her
      blood, now that the worst had been spoken. &lsquo;Forgive me, Mr. Richmond, for
      having secretly induced you to accept the loan from me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Loan!&rsquo; interjected the squire. &lsquo;They fell upon it like a pair of kites.
      You&rsquo;ll find the last ghost of a bone of your loan in a bill, and well
      picked. They&rsquo;ve been doing their bills: I&rsquo;ve heard that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father touched the points of his fingers on his forehead, straining to
      think, too theatrically, but in hard earnest, I believe. He seemed to be
      rising on tiptoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, madam! Dear lady! my friend! Dorothy, my sister! Better a thousand
      times that I had married, though I shrank from a heartless union! This
      money?&mdash;it is not&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man broke in: &lsquo;Are you going to be a damned low vulgar comedian
      and tale of a trumpet up to the end, you Richmond? Don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll gain
      anything by standing there as if you were jumping your trunk from a shark.
      Come, sir, you&rsquo;re in a gentleman&rsquo;s rooms; don&rsquo;t pitch your voice like a
      young jackanapes blowing into a horn. Your gasps and your spasms, and howl
      of a yawning brute! Keep your menagerie performances for your pantomime
      audiences. What are you meaning? Do you pretend you&rsquo;re astonished? She&rsquo;s
      not the first fool of a woman whose money you&rsquo;ve devoured, with your
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; and &ldquo;My dear&rdquo; and mouthing and elbowing your comedy tricks; your
      gabble of &ldquo;Government&rdquo; protection, and scandalous advertisements of the
      by-blow of a star-coated rapscallion. If you&rsquo;ve a recollection of the man
      in you, show your back, and be off, say you&rsquo;ve fought against odds&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t doubt you have, counting the constables&mdash;and own you&rsquo;re a
      villain: plead guilty, and be off and be silent, and do no more harm. Is
      it &ldquo;Government&rdquo; still?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt Dorothy had come round to me. She clutched my arm to restrain me
      from speaking, whispering:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harry, you can&rsquo;t save him. Think of your own head.&rsquo; She made me
      irresolute, and I was too late to check my father from falling into the
      trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Mr. Beltham,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you are hard, sir. I put it to you: had you
      been in receipt of a secret subsidy from Government for a long course of
      years&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long?&rsquo; the squire interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prompt though he would have been to dismiss the hateful person, he was
      not, one could see, displeased to use the whip upon so exciteable and
      responsive a frame. He seemed to me to be basely guilty of leading his
      victim on to expose himself further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no necessity for &ldquo;how long,&rdquo;&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man kept the question on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have to hit my memory, I am shattered, sir. I say, you would be
      justified, amply justified&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long?&rsquo; was reiterated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can at least date it from the period of my marriage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From the date when your scoundrelism first touches my family, that&rsquo;s to
      say! So &ldquo;Government&rdquo; agreed to give you a stipend to support your wife!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Beltham, I breathe with difficulty. It was at that period, on the
      death of a nobleman interested in restraining me&mdash;I was his debtor
      for kindnesses... my head is whirling! I say, at that period, upon the
      recommendation of friends of high standing, I began to agitate for the
      restitution of my rights. From infancy&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To the deuce, your infancy! I know too much about your age. Just hark,
      you Richmond! none of your &ldquo;I was a child&rdquo; to provoke compassion from
      women. I mean to knock you down and make you incapable of hurting these
      poor foreign people you trapped. They defy you, and I&rsquo;ll do my best to
      draw your teeth. Now for the annuity. You want one to believe &lsquo;you thought
      you frightened &ldquo;Government,&rdquo; eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Annual proof was afforded me, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! annual! through Mr. Charles Adolphus Bannerbridge, deceased!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet stepped up to my aunt Dorothy to persuade her to leave the room, but
      she declined, and hung by me, to keep me out of danger, as she hoped, and
      she prompted me with a guarding nervous squeeze of her hand on my arm to
      answer temperately when I was questioned:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harry, do you suspect Government paid that annuity?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not now, certainly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell the man who &lsquo;tis you suspect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt Dorothy said: &lsquo;Harry is not bound to mention his suspicions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell him yourself, then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does it matter&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it matters. I&rsquo;ll break every plank he walks on, and strip him stark
      till he flops down shivering into his slough&mdash;a convicted common
      swindler, with his dinners and Balls and his private bands! Richmond, you
      killed one of my daughters; t&rsquo; other fed you, through her agent, this Mr.
      Charles Adolphus Bannerbridge, from about the date of your snaring my poor
      girl and carrying her off behind your postillions&mdash;your trotting
      undertakers! and the hours of her life reckoned in milestones. She&rsquo;s here
      to contradict me, if she can. Dorothy Beltham was your &ldquo;Government&rdquo; that
      paid the annuity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I took Dorothy Beltham into my arms. She was trembling excessively, yet
      found time to say, &lsquo;Bear up, dearest; keep still.&rsquo; All I thought and felt
      foundered in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while I heard little distinctly of the tremendous tirade which the
      vindictive old man, rendered thrice venomous by the immobility of the
      petrified large figure opposed to him, poured forth. My poor father did
      not speak because he could not; his arms dropped; and such was the torrent
      of attack, with its free play of thunder and lightning in the form of
      oaths, epithets, short and sharp comparisons, bitter home thrusts and most
      vehement imprecatory denunciations, that our protesting voices quailed.
      Janet plucked at my aunt Dorothy&rsquo;s dress to bear her away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t leave my father,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor I you, dear,&rsquo; said the tender woman; and so we remained to be
      scourged by this tongue of incarnate rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You pensioner of a silly country spinster!&rsquo; sounded like a return to
      mildness. My father&rsquo;s chest heaved up.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took advantage of the lull to make myself heard: I did but heap fuel on
      fire, though the old man&rsquo;s splenetic impetus had partly abated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You Richmond! do you hear him? he swears he&rsquo;s your son, and asks to be
      tied to the stake beside you. Disown him, and I&rsquo;ll pay you money and thank
      you. I&rsquo;ll thank my God for anything short of your foul blood in the
      family. You married the boy&rsquo;s mother to craze and kill her, and guttle her
      property. You waited for the boy to come of age to swallow what was
      settled on him. You wait for me to lie in my coffin to pounce on the
      strongbox you think me the fool to toss to a young donkey ready to ruin
      all his belongings for you! For nine-and-twenty years you&rsquo;ve sucked the
      veins of my family, and struck through my house like a rotting-disease.
      Nine-and-twenty years ago you gave a singing-lesson in my house: the pest
      has been in it ever since! You breed vermin in the brain to think of you!
      Your wife, your son, your dupes, every soul that touches you, mildews from
      a blight! You were born of ropery, and you go at it straight, like a
      webfoot to water. What&rsquo;s your boast?&mdash;your mother&rsquo;s disgrace! You
      shame your mother. Your whole life&rsquo;s a ballad o&rsquo; bastardy. You cry up the
      woman&rsquo;s infamy to hook at a father. You swell and strut on her pickings.
      You&rsquo;re a cock forced from the smoke of the dunghill! You shame your
      mother, damned adventurer! You train your boy for a swindler after your
      own pattern; you twirl him in your curst harlequinade to a damnation as
      sure as your own. The day you crossed my threshold the devils danced on
      their flooring. I&rsquo;ve never seen the sun shine fair on me after it. With
      your guitar under the windows, of moonlight nights! your Spanish fopperies
      and trickeries! your French phrases and toeings! I was touched by a leper.
      You set your traps for both my girls: you caught the brown one first, did
      you, and flung her second for t&rsquo; other, and drove a tandem of &lsquo;em to live
      the spangled hog you are; and down went the mother of the boy to the place
      she liked better, and my other girl here&mdash;the one you cheated for her
      salvation&mdash;you tried to cajole her from home and me, to send her the
      same way down. She stuck to decency. Good Lord! you threatened to hang
      yourself, guitar and all. But her purse served your turn. For why? You &lsquo;re
      a leech. I speak before ladies or I&rsquo;d rip your town-life to shreds. Your
      cause! your romantic history! your fine figure! every inch of you &lsquo;s
      notched with villany! You fasten on every moneyed woman that comes in your
      way. You&rsquo;ve outdone Herod in murdering the innocents, for he didn&rsquo;t feed
      on &lsquo;em, and they&rsquo;ve made you fat. One thing I&rsquo;ll say of you: you look the
      beastly thing you set yourself up for. The kindest blow to you &lsquo;s to call
      you impostor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, but his inordinate passion of speech was unsated: his white
      lips hung loose for another eruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      I broke from my aunt Dorothy to cross over to my father, saying on the
      way: &lsquo;We &lsquo;ve heard enough, sir. You forget the cardinal point of
      invective, which is, not to create sympathy for the person you assail.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! you come in with your infernal fine language, do you!&rsquo; the old man
      thundered at me. &lsquo;I &lsquo;ll just tell you at once, young fellow&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt Dorothy supplicated his attention. &lsquo;One error I must correct.&rsquo; Her
      voice issued from a contracted throat, and was painfully thin and
      straining, as though the will to speak did violence to her weaker nature.
      &lsquo;My sister loved Mr. Richmond. It was to save her life, because I believed
      she loved him much and would have died, that Mr. Richmond&mdash;in pity&mdash;offered
      her his hand, at my wish&rsquo;: she bent her head: &lsquo;at my cost. It was done for
      me. I wished it; he obeyed me. No blame&mdash;&rsquo; her dear mouth faltered.
      &lsquo;I am to be accused, if anybody.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She added more firmly: &lsquo;My money would have been his. I hoped to spare his
      feelings, I beg his forgiveness now, by devoting some of it, unknown to
      him, to assist him. That was chiefly to please myself, I see, and I am
      punished.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said the squire, calm at white heat; &lsquo;a fool&rsquo;s confession
      ought to be heard out to the end. What about the twenty-five thousand?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hoped to help my Harry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you do it openly?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She breathed audible long breaths before she could summon courage to say:
      &lsquo;His father was going to make an irreparable sacrifice. I feared that if
      he knew this money came from me he would reject it, and persist.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she disliked the idea of my father&rsquo;s marrying?
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man pounced on the word sacrifice. &lsquo;What sacrifice, ma&rsquo;am? What&rsquo;s
      the sacrifice?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I perceived that she could not without anguish, and perhaps peril of a
      further exposure, bring herself to speak, and explained: &lsquo;It relates to my
      having tried to persuade my father to marry a very wealthy lady, so that
      he might produce the money on the day appointed. Rail at me, sir, as much
      as you like. If you can&rsquo;t understand the circumstances without a chapter
      of statements, I&rsquo;m sorry for you. A great deal is due to you, I know; but
      I can&rsquo;t pay a jot of it while you go on rating my father like a madman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harry!&rsquo; either my aunt or Janet breathed a warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I replied that I was past mincing phrases. The folly of giving the tongue
      an airing was upon me: I was in fact invited to continue, and animated to
      do it thoroughly, by the old man&rsquo;s expression of face, which was that of
      one who says, &lsquo;I give you rope,&rsquo; and I dealt him a liberal amount of stock
      irony not worth repeating; things that any cultivated man in anger can
      drill and sting the Boeotian with, under the delusion that he has not lost
      a particle of his self-command because of his coolness. I spoke very
      deliberately, and therefore supposed that the words of composure were
      those of prudent sense. The error was manifest. The women saw it. One who
      has indulged his soul in invective will not, if he has power in his hand,
      be robbed of his climax with impunity by a cool response that seems to
      trifle, and scourges.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wound up by thanking my father for his devotion to me: I deemed it, I
      said, excessive and mistaken in the recent instance, but it was for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this he awoke from his dreamy-looking stupefaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Richie does me justice. He is my dear boy. He loves me: I love him. None
      can cheat us of that. He loves his wreck of a father. You have struck me
      to your feet, Mr. Beltham.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see you there, sir; I want to see you go, and not stand
      rapping your breast-bone, sounding like a burst drum, as you are,&rsquo; 
      retorted the unappeasable old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I begged him in exasperation to keep his similes to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet and my aunt Dorothy raised their voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father said: &lsquo;I am broken.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He put out a swimming hand that trembled when it rested, like that of an
      aged man grasping a staff. I feared for a moment he was acting, he spoke
      so like himself, miserable though he appeared: but it was his well-known
      native old style in a state of decrepitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am broken,&rsquo; he repeated. &lsquo;I am like the ancient figure of mortality
      entering the mouth of the tomb on a sepulchral monument, somewhere, by a
      celebrated sculptor: I have seen it: I forget the city. I shall presently
      forget names of men. It is not your abuse, Mr. Beltham. I should have
      bowed my head to it till the storm passed. Your facts... Oh! Miss Beltham,
      this last privilege to call you dearest of human beings! my benefactress!
      my blessing! Do not scorn me, madam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never did; I never will; I pitied you,&rsquo; she cried, sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire stamped his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; my father bowed gently. &lsquo;I was under heaven&rsquo;s special protection&mdash;I
      thought so. I feel I have been robbed&mdash;I have not deserved it! Oh!
      madam, no: it was your generosity that I did not deserve. One of the
      angels of heaven persuaded me to trust in it. I did not know.... Adieu,
      madam. May I be worthy to meet you!&mdash;Ay, Mr. Beltham, your facts have
      committed the death-wound. You have taken the staff out of my hand: you
      have extinguished the light. I have existed&mdash;ay, a pensioner,
      unknowingly, on this dear lady&rsquo;s charity; to her I say no more. To you,
      sir, by all that is most sacred to a man-by the ashes of my mother! by the
      prospects of my boy! I swear the annuity was in my belief a tangible token
      that my claims to consideration were in the highest sources acknowledged
      to be just. I cannot speak! One word to you, Mr. Beltham: put me aside, I
      am nothing:&mdash;Harry Richmond!&mdash;his fortunes are not lost; he has
      a future! I entreat you&mdash;he is your grandson&mdash;give him your
      support; go this instant to the prince&mdash;no! you will not deny your
      countenance to Harry Richmond: let him abjure my name; let me be nameless
      in his house. And I promise you I shall be unheard of both in Christendom
      and Heathendom: I have no heart except for my boy&rsquo;s nuptials with the
      princess: this one thing, to see him the husband of the fairest and
      noblest lady upon earth, with all the life remaining in me I pray for! I
      have won it for him. I have a moderate ability, immense devotion. I
      declare to you, sir, I have lived, actually subsisted, on this hope! and I
      have directed my efforts incessantly, sleeplessly, to fortify it. I die to
      do it! I implore you, sir, go to the prince. If I&rsquo; (he said this
      touchingly) &lsquo;if I am any further in anybody&rsquo;s way, it is only as a fallen
      tree.&rsquo; But his inveterate fancifulness led him to add: &lsquo;And that may
      bridge a cataract.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather had been clearing his throat two or three times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I &lsquo;m ready to finish and get rid of you, Richmond.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am gone, sir. I feel I am all but tongue-tied. Think that it is Harry
      who petitions you to ensure his happiness. To-day I guarantee-it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man turned an inquiring eyebrow upon me. Janet laid her hand on
      him. He dismissed the feline instinct to prolong our torture, and
      delivered himself briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Richmond, your last little bit of villany &lsquo;s broken in the egg. I
      separate the boy from you: he&rsquo;s not your accomplice there, I&rsquo;m glad to
      know. You witched the lady over to pounce on her like a fowler, you
      threatened her father with a scandal, if he thought proper to force the
      trap; swore you &lsquo;d toss her to be plucked by the gossips, eh? She&rsquo;s free
      of you! You got your English and your Germans here to point their bills,
      and stretch their necks, and hiss, if this gentleman&mdash;and your
      newspapers!&mdash;if he didn&rsquo;t give up to you like a funky traveller to a
      highwayman. I remember a tale of a clumsy Turpin, who shot himself when he
      was drawing the pistol out of his holsters to frighten the money-bag out
      of a market farmer. You&rsquo;ve done about the same, you Richmond; and, of all
      the damned poor speeches I ever heard from a convicted felon, yours is the
      worst&mdash;a sheared sheep&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; done it more respectably, grant the
      beast a tongue! The lady is free of you, I tell you. Harry has to thank
      you for that kindness. She&mdash;what is it, Janet? Never mind, I&rsquo;ve got
      the story&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t want to marry; but this prince, who called on
      me just now, happened to be her father&rsquo;s nominee, and he heard of your
      scoundrelism, and he behaved like a man and a gentleman, and offered
      himself, none too early nor too late, as it turns out; and the princess,
      like a good girl, has made amends to her father by accepting him. I&rsquo;ve the
      word of this Prince Hermann for it. Now you can look upon a game of
      stale-mate. If I had gone to the prince, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been to back
      your play; but, if you hadn&rsquo;t been guilty of the tricks of a blackguard
      past praying for, this princess would never have been obliged to marry a
      man to protect her father and herself. They sent him here to stop any
      misunderstanding. He speaks good English, so that&rsquo;s certain. Your lies
      will be contradicted, every one of &lsquo;em, seriatim, in to-morrow&rsquo;s
      newspapers, setting the real man in place of the wrong one; and you &lsquo;ll
      draw no profit from them in your fashionable world, where you &lsquo;ve been
      grinning lately, like a blackamoor&rsquo;s head on a conjuror&rsquo;s plate&mdash;the
      devil alone able to account for the body and joinings. Now you can be
      off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I went up to my father. His plight was more desperate than mine, for I had
      resembled the condemned before the firing-party, to whom the expected
      bullet brings a merely physical shock. He, poor man, heard his sentence,
      which is the heart&rsquo;s pang of death; and how fondly and rootedly he had
      clung to the idea of my marriage with the princess was shown in his
      extinction after this blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather chose the moment as a fitting one to ask me for the last
      time to take my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      I replied, without offence in the tones of my voice, that I thought my
      father need not lose me into the bargain, after what he had suffered that
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He just as quietly rejoined with a recommendation to me to divorce myself
      for good and all from a scoundrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took my father&rsquo;s arm: he was not in a state to move away unsupported.
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt Dorothy stood weeping; Janet was at the window, no friend to
      either of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said to her, &lsquo;You have your wish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, but did not look back.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather watched me, step by step, until I had reached the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re going, are you?&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Then I whistle you off my fingers!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      An attempt to speak was made by my father in the doorway. He bowed wide of
      the company, like a blind man. I led him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dimness of sight spared me from seeing certain figures, which were at the
      toll-bar of the pier, on the way to quit our shores. What I heard was not
      of a character to give me faith in the sanity of the companion I had
      chosen. He murmured it at first to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Waddy shall have her monument!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My patience was not proof against the repetition of it aloud to me. Had I
      been gentler I might have known that his nature was compelled to look
      forward to something, and he discerned nothing in the future, save the
      task of raising a memorial to a faithful servant.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIII. THE HEIRESS PROVES THAT SHE INHERITS THE FEUD AND I GO
      DRIFTING
    </h2>
    <p>
      My grandfather lived eight months after a scene that had afforded him high
      gratification at the heaviest cost a plain man can pay for his pleasures:
      it killed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father&rsquo;s supple nature helped him to survive it in apparently unimpeded
      health, so that the world might well suppose him unconquerable, as he
      meant that it should. But I, who was with him, knew, though he never
      talked of his wounds, they had been driven into his heart. He collapsed in
      speech, and became what he used to call &lsquo;one of the ordinary nodding men,&rsquo; 
      forsaken of his swamping initiative. I merely observed him; I did not
      invite his confidences, being myself in no mood to give sympathy or to
      receive it. I was about as tender in my care of him as a military escort
      bound to deliver up a captive alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left him at Bulsted on my way to London to face the creditors. Adversity
      had not lowered the admiration of the captain and his wife for the
      magnificent host of those select and lofty entertainments which I was led
      by my errand to examine in the skeleton, and with a wonder as big as
      theirs, but of another complexion: They hung about him, and perused and
      petted him quaintly; it was grotesque; they thought him deeply injured: by
      what, by whom, they could not say; but Julia was disappointed in me for
      refraining to come out with a sally on his behalf. He had quite
      intoxicated their imaginations. Julia told me of the things he did not do
      as marvellingly as of the things he did or had done; the charm, it seemed,
      was to find herself familiar with him to the extent of all but nursing him
      and making him belong to her. Pilgrims coming upon the source of the
      mysteriously-abounding river, hardly revere it the less because they love
      it more when they behold the babbling channels it issues from; and the
      sense of possession is the secret, I suppose. Julia could inform me
      rapturously that her charge had slept eighteen hours at a spell. His
      remarks upon the proposal to fetch a doctor, feeble in themselves, were
      delicious to her, because they recalled his old humour to show his great
      spirit, and from her and from Captain William in turn I was condemned to
      hear how he had said this and that of the doctor, which in my opinion
      might have been more concise. &lsquo;Really, deuced good indeed!&rsquo; Captain
      William would exclaim. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see it, Harry, my boy? He denies the
      doctor has a right to cast him out of the world on account of his having
      been the official to introduce him, and he&rsquo;ll only consent to be visited
      when he happens to be as incapable of resisting as upon their very first
      encounter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor and death and marriage, I ventured to remind the captain, had
      been riddled in this fashion by the whole army of humourists and their
      echoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and Julia fancied me cold to my father&rsquo;s merits. Fond as they were of
      the squire, they declared war against him in private, they criticized
      Janet, they thought my aunt Dorothy slightly wrong in making a secret of
      her good deed: my father was the victim. Their unabated warmth consoled me
      in the bitterest of seasons. He found a home with them at a time when
      there would have been a battle at every step. The world soon knew that my
      grandfather had cast me off, and with this foundation destroyed, the
      entire fabric of the Grand Parade fell to the ground at once. The crash
      was heavy. Jorian DeWitt said truly that what a man hates in adversity is
      to see &lsquo;faces&rsquo;; meaning that the humanity has gone out of them in their
      curious observation of you under misfortune. You see neither friends nor
      enemies. You are too sensitive for friends, and are blunted against
      enemies. You see but the mask of faces: my father was sheltered from that.
      Julia consulted his wishes in everything; she set traps to catch his
      whims, and treated them as birds of paradise; she could submit to have the
      toppling crumpled figure of a man, Bagenhope, his pensioner and singular
      comforter, in her house. The little creature was fetched out of his haunts
      in London purposely to soothe my father with performances on his ancient
      clarionet, a most querulous plaintive instrument in his discoursing,
      almost the length of himself; and she endured the nightly sound of it in
      the guest&rsquo;s blue bedroom, heroically patient, a model to me. Bagenhope
      drank drams: she allowanced him. He had known my father&rsquo;s mother, and
      could talk of her in his cups: his playing, and his aged tunes, my father
      said, were a certification to him that he was at the bottom of the ladder.
      Why that should afford him peculiar comfort, none of us could comprehend.
      &lsquo;He was the humble lover of my mother, Richie,&rsquo; I heard with some
      confusion, and that he adored her memory. The statement was part of an
      entreaty to me to provide liberally for Bagenhope&rsquo;s pension before we
      quitted England. &lsquo;I am not seriously anxious for much else,&rsquo; said my
      father. Yet was he fully conscious of the defeat he had sustained and the
      catastrophe he had brought down upon me: his touch of my hand told me
      that, and his desire for darkness and sleep. He had nothing to look to,
      nothing to see twinkling its radiance for him in the dim distance now; no
      propitiating Government, no special Providence. But he never once put on a
      sorrowful air to press for pathos, and I thanked him. He was a man endowed
      to excite it in the most effective manner, to a degree fearful enough to
      win English sympathies despite his un-English faults. He could have drawn
      tears in floods, infinite pathetic commiseration, from our grangousier
      public, whose taste is to have it as it may be had to the mixture of
      one-third of nature in two-thirds of artifice. I believe he was expected
      to go about with this beggar&rsquo;s petition for compassion, and it was a
      disappointment to the generous, for which they punished him, that he
      should have abstained. And moreover his simple quietude was really
      touching to true-hearted people. The elements of pathos do not permit of
      their being dispensed from a stout smoking bowl. I have to record no
      pathetic field-day. My father was never insincere in emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spared his friends, chums, associates, excellent men of a kind, the
      trial of their attachment by shunning them. His servants I dismissed
      personally, from M. Alphonse down to the coachman Jeremy, whose speech to
      me was, that he should be happy to serve my father again, or me, if he
      should happen to be out of a situation when either of us wanted him, which
      at least showed his preference for employment: on the other hand,
      Alphonse, embracing the grand extremes of his stereotyped national
      oratory, where &lsquo;SI JAMAIS,&rsquo; like the herald Mercury new-mounting, takes
      its august flight to set in the splendour of &lsquo;ausqu&rsquo;n LA MORT,&rsquo; declared
      all other service than my father&rsquo;s repugnant, and vowed himself to a
      hermitage, remote from condiments. They both meant well, and did but speak
      the diverse language of their blood. Mrs. Waddy withdrew a respited heart
      to Dipwell; it being, according to her experiences, the third time that my
      father had relinquished house and furniture to go into eclipse on the
      Continent after blazing over London. She strongly recommended the
      Continent for a place of restoration, citing his likeness to that animal
      the chameleon, in the readiness with which he forgot himself among them
      that knew nothing of him. We quitted Bulsted previous to the return of the
      family to Riversley. My grandfather lay at the island hotel a month, and
      was brought home desperately ill. Lady Edbury happened to cross the
      channel with us. She behaved badly, I thought; foolishly, my father said.
      She did as much as obliqueness of vision and sharpness of feature could
      help her to do to cut him in the presence of her party: and he would not
      take nay. It seemed in very bad taste on his part; he explained to me
      off-handedly that he insisted upon the exchange of a word or two for the
      single purpose of protecting her from calumny. By and by it grew more
      explicable to me how witless she had been to give gossip a handle in the
      effort to escape it. She sent for him in Paris, but he did not pay the
      visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather and I never saw one another again. He had news of me from
      various quarters, and I of him from one; I was leading a life in marked
      contrast from the homely Riversley circle of days: and this likewise was
      set in the count of charges against my father. Our Continental pilgrimage
      ended in a course of riotousness that he did not participate in, and was
      entirely innocent of, but was held accountable for, because he had been
      judged a sinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am ordered to say,&rsquo; Janet wrote, scrupulously obeying the order, &lsquo;that
      if you will leave Paris and come home, and not delay in doing it, your
      grandfather will receive you on the same footing as heretofore.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As heretofore! in a letter from a young woman supposed to nourish a
      softness!
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not leave my father in Paris, alone; I dared not bring him to
      London. In wrath at what I remembered, I replied that I was willing to
      return to Riversley if my father should find a welcome as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet sent a few dry lines to summon me over in April, a pleasant month on
      heath-lands when the Southwest sweeps them. The squire was dead. I dropped
      my father at Bulsted. I could have sworn to the terms of the Will; Mr.
      Burgin had little to teach me. Janet was the heiress; three thousand
      pounds per annum fell to the lot of Harry Lepel Richmond, to be paid out
      of the estate, and pass in reversion to his children, or to Janet&rsquo;s should
      the aforesaid Harry die childless.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was hard hit, and chagrined, but I was not at all angry, for I knew what
      the Will meant. My aunt Dorothy supplied the interlining eagerly to
      mollify the seeming cruelty. &lsquo;You have only to ask to have it all, Harry.&rsquo; 
      The sturdy squire had done his utmost to forward his cherished wishes
      after death. My aunt received five-and-twenty thousand pounds, the sum she
      had thrown away. &lsquo;I promised that no money of mine should go where the
      other went,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surprise in store for me was to find how much this rough-worded old
      man had been liked by his tenantry, his agents and servants. I spoke of it
      to Janet. &lsquo;They loved him,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;No one who ever met him fairly
      could help loving him.&rsquo; They followed him to his grave in a body. From
      what I chanced to hear among them, their squire was the man of their
      hearts: in short, an Englishman of the kind which is perpetually perishing
      out of the land. Janet expected me to be enthusiastic likewise, or
      remorseful. She expected sympathy; she read me the long list of his
      charities. I was reminded of Julia Bulsted commenting on my father, with
      her this he did and that. &lsquo;He had plenty,&rsquo; I said, and Janet shut her
      lips. Her coldness was irritating.
    </p>
    <p>
      What ground of accusation had she against me? Our situation had become so
      delicate that a cold breath sundered us as far as the Poles. I was at
      liberty to suspect that now she was the heiress, her mind was simply
      obedient to her grandada&rsquo;s wish; but, as I told my aunt Dorothy, I would
      not do her that injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Dorothy; &lsquo;it is the money that makes her position so difficult,
      unless you break the ice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I urged that having steadily refused her before, I could hardly advance
      without some invitation now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What invitation?&rsquo; said my aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a corpse-like consent,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harry,&rsquo; she twitted me, &lsquo;you have not forgiven her.&rsquo; That was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roderick and Lady Ilchester did not conceal their elation at their
      daughter&rsquo;s vast inheritance, though the lady appealed to my feelings in
      stating that her son Charles was not mentioned in the Will. Sir Roderick
      talked of the squire with personal pride:&mdash;&lsquo;Now, as to his management
      of those unwieldy men, his miners they sent him up the items of their
      complaints. He took them one by one, yielding here, discussing there, and
      holding to his point. So the men gave way; he sent them a month&rsquo;s pay to
      reward them for their good sense. He had the art of moulding the men who
      served him in his own likeness. His capacity for business was
      extraordinary; you never expected it of a country gentleman. He more than
      quadrupled his inheritance&mdash;much more!&rsquo; I state it to the worthy
      Baronet&rsquo;s honour, that although it would have been immensely to his
      satisfaction to see his daughter attracting the suitor proper to an
      heiress of such magnitude, he did not attempt to impose restriction upon
      my interviews with Janet: Riversley was mentioned as my home. I tried to
      feel at home; the heir of the place seemed foreign, and so did Janet. I
      attributed it partly to her deep mourning dress that robed her in so
      sedate a womanliness, partly, in spite of myself, to her wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak to her kindly of your grandfather,&rsquo; said my aunt Dorothy. To do so,
      however, as she desired it, would be to be guilty of a form of hypocrisy,
      and I belied my better sentiments by keeping silent. Thus, having ruined
      myself through anger, I allowed silly sensitiveness to prevent the repair.
    </p>
    <p>
      It became known that my father was at Bulsted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw trouble one morning on Janet&rsquo;s forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had a conversation that came near to tenderness; at last she said:
      &lsquo;Will you be able to forgive me if I have ever the misfortune to offend
      you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t offend me,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hoped not.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rallied her: &lsquo;Tut, tut, you talk like any twelve-years-old, Janet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I offended you then!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Every day! it&rsquo;s all that I care much to remember.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked pleased, but I was so situated that I required passion and
      abandonment in return for a confession damaging to my pride. Besides, the
      school I had been graduating in of late unfitted me for a young English
      gentlewoman&rsquo;s shades and intervolved descents of emotion. A glance up and
      a dimple in the cheek, were pretty homely things enough, not the blaze I
      wanted to unlock me, and absolutely thought I had deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Roderick called her to the library on business, which he was in the
      habit of doing ten times a day, as well as of discussing matters of
      business at table, ostentatiously consulting his daughter, with a solemn
      countenance and a transparently reeling heart of parental exultation.
      &lsquo;Janet is supreme,&rsquo; he would say: &lsquo;my advice is simple advice; I am her
      chief agent, that is all.&rsquo; Her chief agent, as director of three Companies
      and chairman of one, was perhaps competent to advise her, he remarked. Her
      judgement upon ordinary matters he agreed with my grandfather in thinking
      consummate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet went to him, and shortly after drove him to the station for London.
      My aunt Dorothy had warned me that she was preparing some deed in my
      favour, and as I fancied her father to have gone to London for that
      purpose, and supposed she would now venture to touch on it, I walked away
      from the East gates of the park as soon as I heard the trot of her ponies,
      and was led by an evil fate (the stuff the fates are composed of in my
      instance I have not kept secret) to walk Westward. Thither my evil fate
      propelled me, where accident was ready to espouse it and breed me
      mortifications innumerable. My father chanced to have heard the
      particulars of Squire Beltham&rsquo;s will that morning: I believe Captain
      William&rsquo;s coachman brushed the subject despondently in my interests; it
      did not reach him through Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood outside the Western gates, and as I approached, I could perceive
      a labour of excitement on his frame. He pulled violently at the bars of
      the obstruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Richie, I am interdicted house and grounds!&rsquo; he called, and waved his
      hand toward the lodge: &lsquo;they decline to open to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Were you denied admission?&rsquo; I asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;Your name, if you please, sir?&mdash;Mr. Richmond Roy.&mdash;We
      are sorry we have orders not to admit you. And they declined; they would
      not admit me to see my son.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those must be the squire&rsquo;s old orders,&rsquo; I said, and shouted to the
      lodge-keeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father, with the forethoughtfulness which never forsook him, stopped
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Richie, no; the good woman shall not have the responsibility of
      letting me in against orders; she may be risking her place, poor soul!
      Help me, dear lad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He climbed the bars to the spikes, tottering, and communicating a
      convulsion to me as I assisted him in the leap down: no common feat for
      one of his age and weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned on me, quaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impossible! Richie, impossible!&rsquo; he cried, and reviewed a series of
      interjections.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some time before I discovered that they related to the Will. He was
      frenzied, and raved, turning suddenly from red to pale under what I feared
      were redoubtable symptoms, physical or mental. He came for sight of the
      Will; he would contest it, overthrow it. Harry ruined? He would see Miss
      Beltham and fathom the plot;&mdash;angel, he called her, and was absurdly
      exclamatory, but in dire earnest. He must have had the appearance of a
      drunken man to persons observing him from the Grange windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father was refused admission at the hall-doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The butler, the brute Sillabin, withstood me impassively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whose orders had he?
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ilchester&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are afraid of me!&rsquo; my father thundered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sent a message to Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not long in coming, followed by a footman who handed a twist of
      note-paper from my aunt Dorothy to my father. He opened it and made
      believe to read it, muttering all the while of the Will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet dismissed the men-servants. She was quite colourless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have been stopped in the doorway,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered: &lsquo;I wish it could have been prevented.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You take it on yourself, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was inaudible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Janet, you call Riversley my home, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is yours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you intend to keep up this hateful feud now my grandfather is dead?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Harry, not I.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you give orders to stop my father from entering the house and
      grounds?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t have him here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Harry, I hoped he would not come just yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you gave the orders?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re rather incomprehensible, my dear Janet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish you could understand me, Harry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You arm your servants against him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In a few days&mdash;&rsquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You insult him and me now,&rsquo; said I, enraged at the half indication of her
      relenting, which spoiled her look of modestly&mdash;resolute beauty, and
      seemed to show that she meant to succumb without letting me break her.
      &lsquo;You are mistress of the place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am. I wish I were not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are mistress of Riversley, and you refuse to let my father come in!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;While I am the mistress, yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anywhere but here, Harry! If he will see me or aunty, if he will kindly
      appoint any other place, we will meet him, we shall be glad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I request you to let him enter the house. Do you consent or not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was refused once at these doors. Do you refuse him a second time?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am obliged to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t yield a step to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit of an armed champion was behind those mild features, soft
      almost to supplication to me, that I might know her to be under a
      constraint. The nether lip dropped in breathing, the eyes wavered: such
      was her appearance in open war with me, but her will was firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I was not so dense as to be unable to perceive her grounds for
      refusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not throw the burden on her grandada, even to propitiate me&mdash;the
      man she still loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that she should have a reason, and think it good, in spite of me, and
      cling to it, defying me, and that she should do hurt to a sentient human
      creature, who was my father, for the sake of blindly obeying to the letter
      the injunction of the dead, were intolerable offences to me and common
      humanity. I, for my own part, would have forgiven her, as I congratulated
      myself upon reflecting. It was on her account&mdash;to open her mind, to
      enlighten her concerning right and wrong determination, to bring her
      feelings to bear upon a crude judgement&mdash;that I condescended to argue
      the case. Smarting with admiration, both of the depths and shallows of her
      character, and of her fine figure, I began:&mdash;She was to consider how
      young she was to pretend to decide on the balance of duties, how little of
      the world she had seen; an oath sworn at the bedside of the dead was a
      solemn thing, but was it Christian to keep it to do an unnecessary cruelty
      to the living? if she had not studied philosophy, she might at least
      discern the difference between just resolves and insane&mdash;between
      those the soul sanctioned, and those hateful to nature; to bind oneself to
      carry on another person&rsquo;s vindictiveness was voluntarily to adopt slavery;
      this was flatly-avowed insanity, and so forth, with an emphatic display of
      patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth of my words could not be controverted. Unhappily I confounded
      right speaking with right acting, and conceived, because I spoke so
      justly, that I was specially approved in pressing her to yield.
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke the first pause to say, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s useless, Harry. I do what I think
      I am bound to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I have spoken to no purpose!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you will only be kind, and wait two or three days?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be sensible!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am, as much as I can be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hard as a flint&mdash;you always were! The most grateful woman alive, I
      admit. I know not another, I assure you, Janet, who, in return for
      millions of money, would do such a piece of wanton cruelty. What! You
      think he was not punished enough when he was berated and torn to shreds in
      your presence? They would be cruel, perhaps&mdash;we will suppose it of
      your sex&mdash;but not so fond of their consciences as to stamp a life out
      to keep an oath. I forget the terms of the Will. Were you enjoined in it
      to force him away?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father had stationed himself in the background. Mention of the Will
      caught his ears, and he commenced shaking my aunt Dorothy&rsquo;s note, blinking
      and muttering at a great rate, and pressing his temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not read a word of this,&rsquo; he said,&mdash;&lsquo;upon my honour, not a
      word; and I know it is her handwriting. That Will!&mdash;only, for the
      love of heaven, madam,&rsquo;&mdash;he bowed vaguely to Janet &lsquo;not a syllable of
      this to the princess, or we are destroyed. I have a great bell in my head,
      or I would say more. Hearing is out of the question.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet gazed piteously from him to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      To kill the deer and be sorry for the suffering wretch is common.
    </p>
    <p>
      I begged my father to walk along the carriage-drive. He required that the
      direction should be pointed out accurately, and promptly obeyed me,
      saying: &lsquo;I back you, remember. I should certainly be asleep now but for
      this extraordinary bell.&rsquo; After going some steps, he turned to shout
      &lsquo;Gong,&rsquo; and touched his ear. He walked loosely, utterly unlike the walk
      habitual to him even recently in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has he been ill?&rsquo; Janet asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t see the doctor; the symptoms threaten apoplexy or paralysis, I
      &lsquo;m told. Let us finish. You were aware that you were to inherit
      Riversley?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Riversley, Harry; I knew that; I knew nothing else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old place was left to you that you might bar my father out?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I gave my word.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You pledged it&mdash;swore?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve done your worst, my dear. If the axe were to fall on your
      neck for it, you would still refuse, would you not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet answered softly: &lsquo;I believe so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, good-bye,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      That feminine softness and its burden of unalterable firmness pulled me
      two ways, angering me all the more that I should feel myself susceptible
      to a charm which came of spiritual rawness rather than sweetness; for she
      needed not to have made the answer in such a manner; there was pride in
      it; she liked the soft sound of her voice while declaring herself
      invincible: I could see her picturing herself meek but fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you go, Harry? Will you not take Riversley?&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To spare you the repetition of the dilemma?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Harry; but this might be done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But&mdash;my fullest thanks to you for your generosity: really! I speak
      in earnest: it would be decidedly against your grandada&rsquo;s wishes, seeing
      that he left the Grange to you, and not to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grandada&rsquo;s wishes! I cannot carry out all his wishes,&rsquo; she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you anxious to?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We were on the delicate ground, as her crimson face revealed to me that
      she knew as well as I.
    </p>
    <p>
      I, however, had little delicacy in leading her on it. She might well feel
      that she deserved some wooing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fancied she was going to be overcome, going to tremble and show herself
      ready to fall on my bosom, and I was uncertain of the amount of
      magnanimity in store there.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied calmly, &lsquo;Not immediately.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not immediately anxious to fulfil his wishes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harry, I find it hard to do those that are thrust on me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, as a matter of serious obligation, you would hold yourself bound by
      and by to perform them all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot speak any further of my willingness, Harry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The sense of duty is evidently always sufficient to make you act upon the
      negative&mdash;to deny, at least?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I daresay,&rsquo; said Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shook hands like a pair of commercial men.
    </p>
    <p>
      I led my father to Bulsted. He was too feverish to remain there. In the
      evening, after having had a fruitless conversation with my aunt Dorothy
      upon the event of the day, I took him to London that he might visit his
      lawyers, who kindly consented to treat him like doctors, when I had
      arranged to make over to them three parts of my annuity, and talked of his
      Case encouragingly; the effect of which should not have astonished me. He
      closed a fit of reverie resembling his drowsiness, by exclaiming: &lsquo;Richie
      will be indebted to his dad for his place in the world after all!&rsquo; 
      Temporarily, he admitted, we must be fugitives from creditors, and as to
      that eccentric tribe, at once so human and so inhuman, he imparted many
      curious characteristics gained of his experience. Jorian DeWitt had indeed
      compared them to the female ivy that would ultimately kill its tree, but
      inasmuch as they were parasites, they loved their debtor; he was life and
      support to them, and there was this remarkable fact about them: by
      slipping out of their clutches at critical moments when they would
      infallibly be pulling you down, you were enabled to return to them fresh,
      and they became inspired with another lease of lively faith in your
      future: et caetera. I knew the language. It was a flash of himself, and a
      bad one, but I was not the person whom he meant to deceive with it. He was
      soon giving me other than verbal proof out of England that he was not
      thoroughly beaten. We had no home in England. At an hotel in Vienna, upon
      the close of the aristocratic season there, he renewed an acquaintance
      with a Russian lady, Countess Kornikoff, and he and I parted. She disliked
      the Margravine of Rippau, who was in Vienna, and did not recognize us. I
      heard that it was the Margravine who had despatched Prince Hermann to
      England as soon as she discovered Ottilia&rsquo;s flight thither. She
      commissioned him to go straightway to Roy in London, and my father&rsquo;s
      having infatuatedly left his own address for Prince Ernest&rsquo;s in the
      island, brought Hermann down: he only met Eckart in the morning train. I
      mention it to show the strange working of events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet sent me a letter by the hands of Temple in August. It was moderately
      well written for so blunt a writer, and might have touched me but for
      other news coming simultaneously that shook the earth under my feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She begged my forgiveness for her hardness, adding characteristically that
      she could never have acted in any other manner. The delusion, that what
      she was she must always be, because it was her nature, had mastered her
      understanding, or rather it was one of the doors of her understanding not
      yet opened: she had to respect her grandada&rsquo;s wishes. She made it likewise
      appear that she was ready for further sacrifices to carry out the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At least you will accept a division of the property, Harry. It should be
      yours. It is an excess, and I feel it a snare to me. I was a selfish
      child: I may not become an estimable woman. You have not pardoned my
      behaviour at the island last year, and I cannot think I was wrong: perhaps
      I might learn: I want your friendship and counsel. Aunty will live with
      me: she says that you would complete us. At any rate I transfer Riversley
      to you. Send me your consent. Papa will have it before the transfer is
      signed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter ended with an adieu, a petition for an answer, and &lsquo;yours
      affectionately.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day of its date, a Viennese newspaper lying on the Salzburg Hotel
      table chronicled Ottilia&rsquo;s marriage with Prince Hermann.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned on Temple to walk him off his legs if I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carry your fever to the Alps, you of minds diseased not to sit down in
      sight of them ruminating, for bodily ease and comfort will trick the soul
      and set you measuring our lean humanity against yonder sublime and
      infinite; but mount, rack the limbs, wrestle it out among the peaks; taste
      danger, sweat, earn rest: learn to discover ungrudgingly that haggard
      fatigue is the fair vision you have run to earth, and that rest is your
      uttermost reward. Would you know what it is to hope again, and have all
      your hopes at hand?&mdash;hang upon the crags at a gradient: that makes
      your next step a debate between the thing you are and the thing you may
      become. There the merry little hopes grow for the climber like flowers and
      food, immediate, prompt to prove their uses, sufficient: if just within
      the grasp, as mortal hopes should be. How the old lax life closes in about
      you there! You are the man of your faculties, nothing more. Why should a
      man pretend to more? We ask it wonderingly when we are healthy. Poetic
      rhapsodists in the vales below may tell you of the joy and grandeur of the
      upper regions, they cannot pluck you the medical herb. He gets that for
      himself who wanders the marshy ledge at nightfall to behold the distant
      Sennhiittchen twinkle, who leaps the green-eyed crevasses, and in the
      solitude of an emerald alp stretches a salt hand to the mountain kine.

      CHAPTER LIV. MY RETURN TO ENGLAND
    </h2>
    <p>
      I passed from the Alps to the desert, and fell in love with the East,
      until it began to consume me. History, like the air we breathe, must be in
      motion to keep us uncorrupt: otherwise its ancient homes are infectious.
      My passion for the sun and his baked people lasted awhile, the drudgery of
      the habit of voluntary exile some time longer, and then, quite unawares, I
      was seized with a thirst for England, so violent that I abandoned a
      correspondence of several months, lying for me both at Damascus and Cairo,
      to catch the boat for Europe. A dream of a rainy morning, in the midst of
      the glowing furnace, may have been the origin of the wild craving I had
      for my native land and Janet. The moist air of flying showers and drenched
      spring buds surrounded her; I saw her plainly lifting a rose&rsquo;s head; was
      it possible I had ever refused to be her yokefellow? Could so noble a
      figure of a fair young woman have been offered and repudiated again and
      again by a man in his senses? I spurned the intolerable idiot, to stop
      reflection. Perhaps she did likewise now. There was nothing to alarm me
      save my own eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of my father was perplexing, leading me to suppose him
      re-established in London, awaiting the coming on of his Case. Whence the
      money?
    </p>
    <p>
      Money and my father, I knew, met as they divided, fortuitously; in
      illustration of which, I well remembered, while passing in view of the Key
      of the Adige along the Lombard plain, a circumstance during my Alpine tour
      with Temple, of more importance to him than to me, when my emulous friend,
      who would never be beaten, sprained his ankle severely on the crags of a
      waterfall, not far from Innsbruck, and was invited into a house by a young
      English lady, daughter of a retired Colonel of Engineers of our army. The
      colonel was an exile from his country for no grave crime: but, as he told
      us, as much an exile as if he had committed a capital offence in being the
      father of nine healthy girls. He had been, against his judgement, he
      averred, persuaded to fix on his Tyrolese spot of ground by the two elder
      ones. Five were now married to foreigners; thus they repaid him, by
      scattering good English blood on the race of Counts and Freiherrs! &lsquo;I
      could understand the decrees of Providence before I was a parent,&rsquo; said
      this dear old Colonel Heddon. &lsquo;I was looking up at the rainbow when I
      heard your steps, asking myself whether it was seen in England at that
      instant, and why on earth I should be out of England!&rsquo; He lived abroad to
      be able to dower his girls. His sons-in-law were gentlemen; so far he was
      condemned to be satisfied, but supposing all his girls married foreigners?
      His primitive frankness charmed us, and it struck me that my susceptible
      Temple would have liked to be in a position to reassure him with regard to
      the Lucy of the four. We were obliged to confess that she was catching a
      foreign accent. The old colonel groaned. He begged us to forgive him for
      not treating us as strangers; his heart leapt out to young English
      gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      My name, he said, reminded him of a great character at home, in the old
      days: a certain Roy-Richmond, son of an actress and somebody, so the story
      went: and there was an old Lord Edbury who knew more about it than most.
      &lsquo;Now Roy was an adventurer, but he had a soul of true chivalry, by gad, he
      had! Plenty of foreign whiffmajigs are to be found, but you won&rsquo;t come
      upon a fellow like that. Where he got his money from none knew: all I can
      say is, I don&rsquo;t believe he ever did a dirty action for it. And one matter
      I&rsquo;ll tell you of: pardon me a moment, Mr. Richmond, I haven&rsquo;t talked
      English for half a century, or, at least, a quarter. Old Lord Edbury put
      him down in his will for some thousands, and he risked it to save a lady,
      who hated him for his pains. Lady Edbury was of the Bolton blood, none of
      the tamest; they breed good cavalry men. She ran away from her husband
      once. The old lord took her back. &ldquo;It &lsquo;s at your peril, mind!&rdquo; says she.
      Well, Roy hears by-and-by of afresh affair. He mounted horse; he was in
      the saddle, I&rsquo;ve been assured, a night and a day, and posted himself
      between my lady&rsquo;s park-gates, and the house, at dusk. The rumour ran that
      he knew of the marquis playing spy on his wife. However, such was the
      fact; she was going off again, and the marquis did play the mean part. She
      walked down the parkroad, and, seeing the cloaked figure of a man, she
      imagined him to be her Lothario, and very naturally, you will own, fell
      into his arms. The gentleman in question was an acquaintance of mine; and
      the less you follow our example the better for you. It was a damnable
      period in morals! He told me that he saw the scene from the gates, where
      he had his carriage-and-four ready. The old lord burst out of an ambush on
      his wife and her supposed paramour; the lady was imprisoned in her
      rescuer&rsquo;s arms, and my friend retired on tiptoe, which was, I incline to
      think, the best thing he could do. Our morals were abominable. Lady Edbury
      would never see Roy-Richmond after that, nor the old lord neither. He
      doubled the sum he had intended to leave him, though. I heard that he
      married a second young wife. Roy, I believe, ended by marrying a great
      heiress, and reforming. He was an eloquent fellow, and stood like a
      general in full uniform, cocked hat and feathers; most amusing fellow at
      table; beat a Frenchman for anecdote.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I spared Colonel Heddon the revelation of my relationship to his hero,
      thanking his garrulity for interrupting me.
    </p>
    <p>
      How I pitied him when I drove past the gates of the main route to
      Innsbruck! For I was bound homeward: I should soon see England, green
      cloudy England, the white cliffs, the meadows, the heaths! And I thanked
      the colonel again in my heart for having done something to reconcile me to
      the idea of that strange father of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      A banner-like stream of morning-coloured smoke rolled North-eastward as I
      entered London, and I drove to Temple&rsquo;s chambers. He was in Court, engaged
      in a case as junior to his father. Temple had become that radiant human
      creature, a working man, then? I walked slowly to the Court, and saw him
      there, hardly recognising him in his wig. All that he had to do was to
      prompt his father in a case of collision at sea; the barque Priscilla had
      run foul of a merchant brig, near the mouth of the Thames, and though I
      did not expect it on hearing the vessel&rsquo;s name, it proved to be no other
      than the barque Priscilla of Captain Jasper Welsh. Soon after I had shaken
      Temple&rsquo;s hand, I was going through the same ceremony with the captain
      himself, not at all changed in appearance, who blessed his heart for
      seeing me, cried out that a beard and mustachios made a foreign face of a
      young Englishman, and was full of the &lsquo;providential&rsquo; circumstance of his
      having confided his case to Temple and his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, ay, Captain Welsh,&rsquo; said Temple, &lsquo;we have pulled you through, only
      another time mind you keep an eye on that look-out man of yours. Some of
      your men, I suspect, see double with an easy conscience. A close net makes
      slippery eels.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you anything to say against my men?&rsquo; the captain inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple replied that he would talk to him about it presently, and laughed
      as he drew me away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His men will get him into a deuce of a scrape some day, Richie. I shall
      put him on his guard. Have you had all my letters? You look made of iron.
      I&rsquo;m beginning capitally, not afraid of the Court a bit, and I hope I&rsquo;m not
      pert. I wish your father had taken it better!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Taken what?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard from him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Two or three times: a mass of interjections.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know he brought his Case forward at last? Of course it went as we all
      knew it would.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is he? Have you seen Janet lately?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is at Miss Ilchester&rsquo;s house in London.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Write the address on a card.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple wrote it rather hesitatingly, I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      We talked of seeing one another in the evening, and I sprang off to
      Janet&rsquo;s residence, forgetting to grasp my old friend&rsquo;s hand at parting. I
      was madly anxious to thank her for the unexpected tenderness to my father.
      And now nothing stood between us!
    </p>
    <p>
      My aunt Dorothy was the first to welcome me. &lsquo;He must be prepared for the
      sight of you, Harry. The doctors say that a shock may destroy him. Janet
      treats him so wonderfully.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I pressed her on my heart and cheered her, praising Janet. She wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there anything new the matter?&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It &lsquo;s not new to us, Harry. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re brave?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brave! what am I asked to bear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Much, if you love her, Harry!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is better you should hear it from me, Harry. I wrote you word of it.
      We all imagined it would not be disagreeable to you. Who could foresee
      this change in you? She least of all!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s in love with some one?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not say in love.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me the worst.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is engaged to be married.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet came into the room&mdash;another Janet for me. She had engaged
      herself to marry the Marquis of Edbury. At the moment when she enslaved me
      with gratitude and admiration she was lost to me. I knew her too well to
      see a chance of her breaking her pledged word.
    </p>
    <p>
      My old grandfather said of Janet, &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a compassionate thing.&rsquo; I felt
      now the tears under his speech, and how late I was in getting wisdom.
      Compassion for Edbury in Janet&rsquo;s bosom was the matchmaker&rsquo;s chief engine
      of assault, my aunt Dorothy told me. Lady Ilchester had been for this
      suitor, Sir Roderick for the other, up to the verge of a quarrel between
      the most united of wedding couples. Janet was persecuted. She heard that
      Edbury&rsquo;s life was running to waste; she liked him for his cricketing and
      hunting, his frankness, seeming manliness, and general native English
      enthusiasm. I permitted myself to comprehend the case as far as I could
      allow myself to excuse her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy Beltham told me something of Janet that struck me to the dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is this, dear Harry; bear to hear it! Janet and I and his good true
      woman of a housekeeper, whose name is Waddy, we are, I believe, the only
      persons that know it. He had a large company to dine at a City tavern, she
      told us, on the night after the decision&mdash;when the verdict went
      against him. The following morning I received a note from this good Mrs.
      Waddy addressed to Sir Roderick&rsquo;s London house, where I was staying with
      Janet; it said that he was ill; and Janet put on her bonnet at once to go
      to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The lady didn&rsquo;t fear contagion any longer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She went, walking fast. He was living in lodgings, and the people of the
      house insisted on removing him, Mrs. Waddy told us. She was cowering in
      the parlour. I had not the courage to go upstairs. Janet went by herself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart rose on a huge swell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She was alone with him, Harry. We could hear them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy Beltham looked imploringly on me to waken my whole comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She subdued him. When I saw him he was white as death, but quiet, not
      dangerous at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean she found him raving?&rsquo; I cried out on our Maker&rsquo;s name, in
      grief and horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, dear Harry, it was so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She stepped between him and an asylum?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She quitted Sir Roderick&rsquo;s house to lodge your father safe in one that
      she hired, and have him under her own care. She watched him day and night
      for three weeks, and governed him, assisted only at intervals by the poor
      frightened woman, Mrs. Waddy, and just as frightened me. And I am still
      subject to the poor woman&rsquo;s way of pressing her hand to her heart at a
      noise. It &lsquo;s over now. Harry, Janet wished that you should never hear of
      it. She dreads any excitement for him. I think she is right in fancying
      her own influence the best: he is used to it. You know how gentle she is
      though she is so firm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t torture me, ma&rsquo;am, for God&rsquo;s sake,&rsquo; I called aloud.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LV. I MEET MY FIRST PLAYFELLOW AND TAKE MY PUNISHMENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      There came to me a little note on foreign paper, unaddressed, an enclosure
      forwarded by Janet, and containing merely one scrap from the playful
      XENIEN of Ottilia&rsquo;s favourite brotherly poets, of untranslatable flavour:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Who shuns true friends flies fortune in the concrete:
     Would he see what he aims at? let him ask his heels.
</pre>
    <p>
      It filled me with a breath of old German peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this I learnt that Ottilia and Janet corresponded. Upon what topics?
      to what degree of intimacy?
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet now confessed to me that their intimacy had never known reserve. The
      princess had divined her attachment for Harry Richmond when their
      acquaintance was commenced in the island, and knew at the present moment
      that I had travelled round to the recognition of Janet&rsquo;s worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus encouraged by the princess&rsquo;s changeless friendship, I wrote to her,
      leaving little to be guessed of my state of mind, withholding nothing of
      the circumstances surrounding me. Imagination dealt me all my sharpest
      misery, and now that Ottilia resumed her place there, I became infinitely
      peacefuller, and stronger to subdue my hungry nature. It caused me no
      pang, strangely though it read in my sight when written, to send warm
      greetings and respects to the prince her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it any waste of time to write of love? The trials of life are in it,
      but in a narrow ring and a fierier. You may learn to know yourself through
      love, as you do after years of life, whether you are fit to lift them that
      are about you, or whether you are but a cheat, and a load on the backs of
      your fellows. The impure perishes, the inefficient languishes, the
      moderate comes to its autumn of decay&mdash;these are of the kinds which
      aim at satisfaction to die of it soon or late. The love that survives has
      strangled craving; it lives because it lives to nourish and succour like
      the heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to strangle craving is indeed to go through a death before you reach
      your immortality.
    </p>
    <p>
      But again, to write of a love perverted by all the elements contributing
      to foolishness, and foredoomed to chastisement, would be a graceless
      business. Janet and I went through our trial, she, you may believe, the
      braver under the most to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was taken by Temple down to the ship&mdash;smelling East of London, for
      the double purpose of trying to convince Captain Welsh of the extravagance
      of a piece of chivalry he was about to commit, and of seeing a lady with a
      history, who had recently come under his guardianship. Temple thought I
      should know her, but he made a mystery of it until the moment of our
      introduction arrived, not being certain of her identity, and not wishing
      to have me disappointed. It appeared that Captain Welsh questioned his men
      closely after he had won his case, and he arrived at the conclusion that
      two or three of them had been guilty of false swearing in his interests.
      He did not dismiss them, for, as he said, it was twice a bad thing to turn
      sinners loose: it was to shove them out of the direct road of amendment,
      and it was a wrong to the population. He insisted, however, on paying the
      legal costs and an indemnity for the collision at sea; and Temple was in
      great distress about it, he having originally suggested the suspicion of
      his men to Captain Welsh. &lsquo;I wanted to put him on his guard against those
      rascals,&rsquo; Temple said, &lsquo;and I suppose,&rsquo; he sighed, &lsquo;I wanted the old
      captain to think me enormously clever all round.&rsquo; He shook himself, and
      assumed a bearish aspect, significant of disgust and recklessness. &lsquo;The
      captain &lsquo;ll be ruined, Richie; and he&rsquo;s not young, you know, to go on
      sailing his barque Priscilla for ever. If he pays, why, I ought to pay,
      and then you ought to pay, for I shouldn&rsquo;t have shown off before him
      alone, and then the wind that fetched you ought to pay. Toss common sense
      overboard, there&rsquo;s no end to your fine-drawings; that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s always
      safest to swear by the Judge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We rolled down to the masts among the chimneys on the top of an omnibus.
      The driver was eloquent on cricket-matches. Now, cricket, he said, was
      fine manly sport; it might kill a man, but it never meant mischief:
      foreigners themselves had a bit of an idea that it was the best game in
      the world, though it was a nice joke to see a foreigner playing at it!
      None of them could stand to be bowled at. Hadn&rsquo;t stomachs for it; they&rsquo;d
      have to train for soldiers first. On one occasion he had seen a Frenchman
      looking on at a match. &lsquo;Ball was hit a shooter twixt the slips: off starts
      Frenchman, catches it, heaves it up, like his head, half-way to wicket,
      and all the field set to bawling at him, and sending him, we knew where.
      He tripped off: &ldquo;You no comprong politeness in dis country.&rdquo; Ha! ha!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To prove the aforesaid Frenchman wrong, we nodded to the driver&rsquo;s laughter
      at his exquisite imitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He informed us that he had backed the Surrey Eleven last year, owing to
      the report of a gentleman-bowler, who had done things in the way of
      tumbling wickets to tickle the ears of cricketers. Gentlemen-batters were
      common: gentlemen-bowlers were quite another dish. Saddlebank was the
      gentleman&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old Nandrew Saddle?&rsquo; Temple called to me, and we smiled at the
      supposition of Saddlebank&rsquo;s fame, neither of us, from what we had known of
      his bowling, doubting that he deserved it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Acquainted with him, gentlemen?&rsquo; the driver inquired, touching his hat.
      &lsquo;Well, and I ask why don&rsquo;t more gentlemen take to cricket? &lsquo;stead of
      horses all round the year! Now, there&rsquo;s my notion of happiness,&rsquo; said the
      man condemned to inactivity, in the perpetual act of motion; &lsquo;cricket in
      cricket season! It comprises&mdash;count: lots o&rsquo; running; and that&rsquo;s
      good: just enough o&rsquo; taking it easy; that&rsquo;s good: a appetite for your
      dinner, and your ale or your Port, as may be the case; good, number three.
      Add on a tired pipe after dark, and a sound sleep to follow, and you say
      good morning to the doctor and the parson; for you&rsquo;re in health body and
      soul, and ne&rsquo;er a parson &lsquo;ll make a better Christian of ye, that I&rsquo;ll
      swear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As if anxious not to pervert us, he concluded: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I think,
      gentlemen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple and I talked of the ancient raptures of a first of May
      cricketing-day on a sunny green meadow, with an ocean of a day before us,
      and well-braced spirits for the match. I had the vision of a matronly, but
      not much altered Janet, mounted on horseback, to witness the performance
      of some favourite Eleven of youngsters with her connoisseur&rsquo;s eye; and
      then the model of an English lady, wife, and mother, waving adieu to the
      field and cantering home to entertain her husband&rsquo;s guests. Her husband!
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple was aware of my grief, but saw no remedy. I knew that in his heart
      he thought me justly punished, though he loved me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had a long sitting with Captain Welsh, whom I found immoveable, as I
      expected I should. His men, he said, had confessed their sin similarly to
      the crab in a hole, with one claw out, as the way of sinners was. He
      blamed himself mainly. &lsquo;Where you have accidents, Mr. Richmond, you have
      faults; and where you have faults aboard a ship you may trace a line to
      the captain. I should have treated my ship&rsquo;s crew like my conscience, and
      gone through them nightly. As it is, sir, here comes round one of your
      accidents to tell me I have lived blinded by conceit. That is my
      affliction, my young friend. The payment of the money is no more so than
      to restore money held in trust.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple and I argued the case with him, as of old on our voyage, on board
      the barque Priscilla, quite unavailingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is a verdict built on lies one that my Maker approves of?&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;If I
      keep possession of that money, my young friends, will it clothe me? Ay,
      with stings! Will it feed me? Ay, with poison. And they that should be
      having it shiver and want!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was emphatic, as he would not have been, save to read us an example,
      owing to our contention with him. &lsquo;The money is Satan in my very hands!&rsquo; 
      When he had dismissed the subject he never returned to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His topic of extreme happiness, to which Temple led him, was the rescue of
      a beautiful sinner from a life of shame. It appeared that Captain Welsh
      had the habit between his voyages of making one holiday expedition to the
      spot of all creation he thought the fairest, Richmond Hill, overlooking
      the Thames; and there, one evening, he espied a lady in grief, and spoke
      to her, and gave her consolation. More, he gave her a blameless home. The
      lady&rsquo;s name was Mabel Bolton. She was in distress of spirit rather than of
      circumstances, for temptation was thick about one so beautiful, to supply
      the vanities and luxuries of the father of sin. He described her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was my first playfellow, the miller&rsquo;s daughter of Dipwell, Mabel
      Sweetwinter, taken from her home by Lord Edbury during my German
      university career, and now put away by him upon command of his family on
      the eve of his marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      She herself related her history to me, after telling me that she had seen
      me once at the steps of Edbury&rsquo;s Club. Our meeting was no great surprise
      to either of us. She had heard my name as that of an expected visitor; she
      had seen Temple, moreover, and he had prompted me with her Christian name
      and the praise of her really glorious hair, to anticipate the person who
      was ushered into the little cabin-like parlour by Captain Welsh&rsquo;s good old
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Edbury she could not speak for grief, believing that he loved her still
      and was acting under compulsion. Her long and faithful attachment to the
      scapegrace seemed to preserve her from the particular regrets Captain
      Welsh supposed to occupy her sinner&rsquo;s mind; so that, after some minutes of
      the hesitation and strangeness due to our common recollections, she talked
      of him simply and well&mdash;as befitted her situation, a worldling might
      say. But she did not conceal her relief in escaping to this quaint little
      refuge (she threw a kindly-comical look, not overtoned, at the miniature
      ships on the mantelpiece, and the picture of Joseph leading Mary with her
      babe on the ass) from the temptations I could imagine a face like hers
      would expose her to. The face was splendid, the figure already overblown.
      I breathed some thanks to my father while she and I conversed apart. The
      miller was dead, her brother in America. She had no other safe home than
      the one Captain Welsh had opened to her. When I asked her (I had no excuse
      for it) whether she would consent to go to Edbury again, she reddened and
      burst into tears. I cursed my brutality. &lsquo;Let her cry,&rsquo; said Captain Welsh
      on parting with us at his street door. &lsquo;Tears are the way of women and
      their comfort.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To our astonishment he told us he intended to take her for a voyage in the
      Priscilla. &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; we asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I take her,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;because not to do things wholly is worse than not
      to do things at all, for it &lsquo;s waste of time and cause for a chorus below,
      down in hell, my young friends. The woman is beautiful as Solomon&rsquo;s bride.
      She is weak as water. And the man is wicked. He has written to her a
      letter. He would have her reserved for himself, a wedded man: such he is,
      or is soon to be. I am searching, and she is not deceitful; and I am a
      poor man again and must go the voyage. I wrestled with her, and by grace I
      conquered her to come with me of a free will, and be out of his snares.
      Aboard I do not fear him, and she shall know the mercy of the Lord on high
      seas.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We grimaced a little on her behalf, but had nothing to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Janet after Mabel was strange. In the latter one could perceive the
      palpably suitable mate for Edbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt that my darling was insulted&mdash;no amends for it I had to keep
      silent and mark the remorseless preparations going forward. Not so Heriot.
      He had come over from the camp in Ireland on leave at this juncture. His
      talk of women still suggested the hawk with the downy feathers of the last
      little plucked bird sticking to his beak; but his appreciation of Janet
      and some kindness for me made him a vehement opponent of her resolve. He
      took licence of his friendship to lay every incident before her, to
      complete his persuasions. She resisted his attacks, as I knew she would,
      obstinately, and replied to his entreaties with counter-supplications that
      he should urge me to accept old Riversley. The conflicts went on between
      those two daily, and I heard of them from Heriot at night. He refused to
      comprehend her determination under the head of anything save madness.
      Varied by reproaches of me for my former inveterate blindness, he raved
      upon Janet&rsquo;s madness incessantly, swearing that he would not be beaten. I
      told him his efforts were useless, but thought them friendly, and so they
      were, only Janet&rsquo;s resistance had fired his vanity, and he stalked up and
      down my room talking a mixture of egregious coxcombry and hearty good
      sense that might have shown one the cause he meant to win had become
      personal to him. Temple, who was sometimes in consultation with him, and
      was always amused by his quasi-fanfaronade, assured me that Herriot was
      actually scheming. The next we heard of him was, that he had been seen at
      a whitebait hotel down the river drunk with Edbury. Janet also heard of
      that, and declined to see Heriot again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our last days marched frightfully fast. Janet had learnt that any the most
      distant allusion to her marriage day was an anguish to the man who was not
      to marry her, so it was through my aunt Dorothy that I became aware of
      Julia Bulsted&rsquo;s kindness in offering to take charge of my father for a
      term. Lady Sampleman undertook to be hostess to him for one night, the eve
      of Janet&rsquo;s nuptials. He was quiet, unlikely to give annoyance to persons
      not strongly predisposed to hear sentences finished and exclamations fall
      into their right places.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adieu to my darling! There have been women well won; here was an adorable
      woman well lost. After twenty years of slighting her, did I fancy she
      would turn to me and throw a man over in reward of my ultimate recovery of
      my senses?&mdash;or fancy that one so tenacious as she had proved would
      snap a tie depending on her pledged word? She liked Edbury; she saw the
      best of him, and liked him. The improved young lord was her handiwork.
      After the years of humiliation from me, she had found herself courted by a
      young nobleman who clung to her for help, showed improvement, and brought
      her many compliments from a wondering world. She really felt that she was
      strength and true life to him. She resisted Heriot: she resisted a more
      powerful advocate, and this was the princess Ottilia. My aunt Dorothy told
      me that the princess had written. Janet either did or affected to weigh
      the princess&rsquo;s reasonings; and she did not evade the task of furnishing a
      full reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her resolution was unchanged. Loss of colour, loss of light in her eyes,
      were the sole signs of what it cost her to maintain it. Our task was to
      transfer the idea of Janet to that of Julia in my father&rsquo;s whirling brain,
      which at first rebelled violently, and cast it out like a stick thrust
      between rapidly revolving wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night before I was to take him away, she gave me her hand with a
      &lsquo;good-bye, dear Harry.&rsquo; My words were much the same. She had a ghastly
      face, but could not have known it, for she smiled, and tried to keep the
      shallow smile in play, as friends do. There was the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came abruptly, and was schoolingly cold and short.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had the effect on me of freezing my blood and setting what seemed to be
      the nerves of my brain at work in a fury of calculation to reckon the
      minutes remaining of her maiden days. I had expected nothing, but now we
      had parted I thought that one last scene to break my heart on should not
      have been denied to me. My aunt Dorothy was a mute; she wept when I spoke
      of Janet, whatever it was I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minutes ran on from circumstance to circumstance of the destiny Janet
      had marked for herself, each one rounded in my mind of a blood colour like
      the edge about prismatic hues. I lived through them a thousand times
      before they occurred, as the wretch who fears death dies multitudinously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some womanly fib preserved my father from a shock on leaving Janet&rsquo;s
      house. She left it herself at the same time that she drove him to Lady
      Sampleman&rsquo;s, and I found him there soon after she had gone to her
      bridesmaids. A letter was for me:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;DEAR HARRY,&mdash;I shall not live at Riversley, never go there again;
   do not let it be sold to a stranger; it will happen unless you go
   there. For the sake of the neighbourhood and poor people, I cannot
   allow it to be shut up. I was the cause of the chief misfortune.
   You never blamed me. Let me think that the old place is not dead.
   Adieu.

   &lsquo;Your affectionate,
                  &lsquo;JANET.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      I tore the letter to pieces, and kept them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aspect of the new intolerable world I was to live in after to-morrow,
      paralyzed sensation. My father chattered, Lady Sampleman hushed him; she
      said I might leave him to her, and I went down to Captain Welsh to bid him
      good-bye and get such peace as contact with a man clad in armour proof
      against earthly calamity could give.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was startled to see little Kiomi in Mabel&rsquo;s company.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had met accidentally at the head of the street, and had been friends
      in childhood, Captain Welsh said, adding: &lsquo;She hates men.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good reason, when they&rsquo;re beasts,&rsquo; said Kiomi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid much weeping of Mabel and old Mrs. Welsh, Kiomi showed as little
      trouble as the heath when the woods are swept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Welsh wanted Mabel to be on board early, owing, he told me, to
      information. Kiomi had offered to remain on board with her until the
      captain was able to come. He had business to do in the City.
    </p>
    <p>
      We saw them off from the waterside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Were I to leave that young woman behind me, on shore, I should be giving
      the devil warrant to seize upon his prey,&rsquo; said Captain Welsh, turning his
      gaze from the boat which conveyed Kiomi and Mabel to the barque Priscilla.
      He had information that the misleader of her youth was hunting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and I parted, and for ever, at a corner of crossways in the central
      city. There I saw the last of one who deemed it as simple a matter to
      renounce his savings for old age, to rectify an error of justice, as to
      plant his foot on the pavement; a man whose only burden was the folly of
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought to myself in despair, under what protest can I also escape from
      England and my own intemperate mind? It seemed a miraculous answer:&mdash;There
      lay at my chambers a note written by Count Kesensky; I went to the
      embassy, and heard of an Austrian ship of war being at one of our ports
      upon an expedition to the East, and was introduced to the captain, a
      gentlemanly fellow, like most of the officers of his Government. Finding
      in me a German scholar, and a joyful willingness, he engaged me to take
      the post of secretary to the expedition in the place of an invalided
      Freiherr von Redwitz. The bargain was struck immediately: I was to be
      ready to report myself to the captain on board not later than the
      following day. Count Kesensky led me aside: he regretted that he could do
      nothing better for me: but I thought his friendliness extreme and
      astonishing, and said so; whereupon the count assured me that his
      intentions were good, though he had not been of great use hitherto&mdash;an
      allusion to the borough of Chippenden he had only heard of von Redwitz&rsquo;s
      illness that afternoon. I thanked him cordially, saying I was much in his
      debt, and he bowed me out, letting me fancy, as my father had fancied
      before me, and as though I had never observed and reflected in my life,
      that the opportuneness of this intervention signified a special action of
      Providence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flattery of the thought served for an elixir. But with whom would my
      father abide during my absence? Captain Bulsted and Julia saved me from a
      fit of remorse; they had come up to town on purpose to carry him home with
      them, and had left a message on my table, and an invitation to dinner at
      their hotel, where the name of Janet was the Marino Faliero of our review
      of Riversley people and old times. The captain and his wife were indignant
      at her conduct. Since, however, I chose to excuse it, they said they would
      say nothing more about her, and she was turned face to the wall. I told
      them how Janet had taken him for months. &lsquo;But I &lsquo;ll take him for years,&rsquo; 
      said Julia. &lsquo;The truth is, Harry, my old dear! William and I are never so
      united&mdash;for I&rsquo;m ashamed to quarrel with him&mdash;as when your
      father&rsquo;s at Bulsted. He belongs to us, and other people shall know you &lsquo;re
      not obliged to depend on your family for help, and your aunt Dorothy can
      come and see him whenever she likes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That was settled. Captain Bulsted went with me to Lady Sampleman&rsquo;s to
      prepare my father for the change of nurse and residence. We were informed
      that he had gone down with Alderman Duke Saddlebank to dine at one of the
      great City Companies&rsquo; halls. I could hardly believe it. &lsquo;Ah! my dear Mr.
      Harry,&rsquo; said Lady Sampleman, &lsquo;old friends know one another best, believe
      that, now. I treated him as if he was as well as ever he was, gave him his
      turtle and madeira lunch; and Alderman Saddlebank, who lunched here&mdash;your
      father used to say, he looks like a robin hopping out of a larderquite
      jumped to dine him in the City like old times; and he will see a great
      spread of plate!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought my father only moderately unwell, wanting novelty. Captain
      Bulsted agreed with me that it would be prudent to go and fetch him. At
      the door of the City hall stood Andrew Saddlebank, grown to be simply a
      larger edition of Rippenger&rsquo;s head boy, and he imparted to us that my
      father was &lsquo;on his legs&rsquo; delivering a speech: It alarmed me. With
      Saddlebank&rsquo;s assistance I pushed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A prince! a treacherous lover! an unfatherly man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Those were the words I caught: a reproduction of many of my phrases
      employed in our arguments on this very subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bade his audience to beware of princes, beware of idle princes; and
      letting his florid fancy loose on these eminent persons, they were at one
      moment silver lamps, at another poising hawks, and again sprawling
      pumpkins; anything except useful citizens. How could they be? They had the
      attraction of the lamp, the appetite of the hawk, the occupation of the
      pumpkin: nothing was given them to do but to shine, destroy, and fatten.
      Their hands were kept empty: a trifle in their heads would topple them
      over; they were monuments of the English system of compromise. Happy for
      mankind if they were monuments only! Happy for them! But they had the
      passions of men. The adulation of the multitude was raised to inflate
      them, whose self-respect had not one prop to rest on, unless it were
      contempt for the flatterers and prophetic foresight of their perfidy. They
      were the monuments of a compromise between the past and terror of the
      future; puppets as princes, mannikins as men, the snares of frail women,
      stop-gaps of the State, feathered nonentities!
    </p>
    <p>
      So far (but not in epigram) he marshalled the things he had heard to his
      sound of drum and trumpet, like one repeating a lesson off-hand. Steering
      on a sudden completely round, he gave his audience an outline of the
      changes he would have effected had he but triumphed in his cause; and now
      came the lashing of arms, a flood of eloquence. Princes with brains,
      princes leaders, princes flowers of the land, he had offered them! princes
      that should sway assemblies, and not stultify the precepts of a decent
      people &lsquo;by making you pay in the outrage of your morals for what you seem
      to gain in policy.&rsquo; These or similar words. The whole scene was too
      grotesque and afflicting. But his command of his hearers was
      extraordinary, partly a consolation I thought, until, having touched the
      arm of one of the gentlemen of the banquet and said, &lsquo;I am his son; I wish
      to remove him,&rsquo; the reply enlightened me: &lsquo;I &lsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s danger in
      interrupting him; I really am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were listening obediently to one whom they dared not interrupt for
      fear of provoking an outburst of madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to risk it. His dilated eyes looked ready to seize on me for an
      illustration. I spoke peremptorily, and he bowed his head low, saying, &lsquo;My
      son, gentlemen,&rsquo; and submitted himself to my hands. The feasters showed
      immediately that they felt released by rising and chatting in groups.
      Alderman Saddlebank expressed much gratitude to me for the service I had
      performed. &lsquo;That first half of your father&rsquo;s speech was the most pathetic
      thing I ever heard!&rsquo; I had not shared his privilege, and could not say.
      The remark was current that a great deal was true of what had been said of
      the Fitzs. My father leaned heavily on my arm with the step and bent head
      of an ancient pensioner of the Honourable City Company. He was Julia
      Bulsted&rsquo;s charge, and I was on board the foreign vessel weighing anchor
      from England before dawn of Janet&rsquo;s marriage-day.

      CHAPTER LVI. CONCLUSION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The wind was high that morning. The rain came in gray rings, through which
      we worked on the fretted surface of crumbling seas, heaving up and
      plunging, without an outlook.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember having thought of the barque Priscilla as I watched our lithe
      Dalmatians slide along the drenched decks of the Verona frigate. At night
      it blew a gale. I could imagine it to have been sent providentially to
      brush the torture of the land from my mind, and make me feel that men are
      trifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      What are their passions, then? The storm in the clouds&mdash;even more
      short-lived than the clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      I philosophized, but my anguish was great.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet&rsquo;s &lsquo;Good-bye, Harry,&rsquo; ended everything I lived for, and seemed to
      strike the day, and bring out of it the remorseless rain. A featureless
      day, like those before the earth was built; like night under an angry
      moon; and each day the same until we touched the edge of a southern circle
      and saw light, and I could use my brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter most present to me was my injustice regarding my poor father&rsquo;s
      speech in the City hall. He had caused me to suffer so much that I
      generally felt for myself when he appealed for sympathy, or provoked some
      pity: but I was past suffering, and letting kindly recollection divest the
      speech of its verbiage, I took it to my heart. It was true that he had in
      his blind way struck the keynote of his position, much as I myself had
      conceived it before. Harsh trials had made me think of my own fortunes
      more than of his. This I felt, and I thought there never had been so
      moving a speech. It seemed to make the world in debt to us. What else is
      so consolatory to a ruined man?
    </p>
    <p>
      In reality the busy little creature within me, whom we call self, was
      digging pits for comfort to flow in, of any kind, in any form; and it
      seized on every idea, every circumstance, to turn it to that purpose, and
      with such success, that when by-and-by I learnt how entirely inactive
      special Providence had been in my affairs, I had to collect myself before
      I could muster the conception of gratitude toward the noble woman who
      clothed me in the illusion. It was to the Princess Ottilia, acting through
      Count Kesensky, that I owed both my wafting away from England at a
      wretched season, and that chance of a career in Parliament! The captain of
      the Verona hinted as much when, after a year of voyaging, we touched at an
      East Indian seaport, and von Redwitz joined the vessel to resume the post
      I was occupying. Von Redwitz (the son of Prince Ernest&rsquo;s Chancellor, I
      discovered) could have told me more than he did, but he handed me a letter
      from the princess, calling me home urgently, and even prescribing my
      route, and bidding me come straight to Germany and to Sarkeld. The summons
      was distasteful, for I had settled into harness under my scientific
      superiors, and had proved to my messmates that I was neither morose nor
      over-conceited. Captain Martinitz persuaded me to return, and besides,
      there lay between the lines of Ottilia&rsquo;s letter a signification of welcome
      things better guessed at than known. Was I not bound to do her bidding?
      Others had done it: young von Redwitz, for instance, in obeying the
      telegraph wires and feigning sickness to surrender his place to me, when
      she wished to save me from misery by hurrying me to new scenes with a task
      for my hand and head;&mdash;no mean stretch of devotion on his part.
      Ottilia was still my princess; she my providence. She wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come home, my friend Harry: you have been absent too long. He who
      intercepts you to displace you has his career before him in the vessel,
      and you nearer home. The home is always here where I am, but it may now
      take root elsewhere, and it is from Ottilia you hear that delay is now
      really loss of life. I tell you no more. You know me, that when I say
      come, it is enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A simple adieu and her name ended the mysterious letter. Not a word of
      Prince Hermann. What had happened? I guessed at it curiously and
      incessantly and only knew the nature of my suspicion by ceasing to hope as
      soon as I seemed to have divined it. I did not wrong my soul&rsquo;s high
      mistress beyond the one flash of tentative apprehension which in
      perplexity struck at impossibilities. Ottilia would never have summoned me
      to herself. But was Janet free? The hope which refused to live in that
      other atmosphere of purest calm, sprang to full stature at the bare
      thought, and would not be extinguished though all the winds beset it. Had
      my girl&rsquo;s courage failed, to spare her at the last moment? I fancied it
      might be: I was sure it was not so. Yet the doubt pressed on me with the
      force of a world of unimagined shifts and chances, and just kept the
      little flame alive, at times intoxicating me, though commonly holding me
      back to watch its forlorn conflict with probabilities known too well. It
      cost me a struggle to turn aside to Germany from the Italian highroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      I chose the line of the Brenner, and stopped half a day at Innsbruck to
      pay a visit to Colonel Heddon, of whom I had the joyful tidings that two
      of his daughters were away to go through the German form of the betrothal
      of one of them to an Englishman. The turn of the tide had come to him. And
      it comes to me, too, in a fresh spring tide whenever I have to speak of
      others instead of this everlastingly recurring I of the autobiographer, of
      which the complacent penman has felt it to be his duty to expose the
      mechanism when out of action, and which, like so many of our sins of
      commission, appears in the shape of a terrible offence when the occasion
      for continuing it draws to a close. The pleasant narrator in the first
      person is the happy bubbling fool, not the philosopher who has come to
      know himself and his relations toward the universe. The words of this last
      are one to twenty; his mind is bent upon the causes of events rather than
      their progress. As you see me on the page now, I stand somewhere between
      the two, approximating to the former, but with sufficient of the latter
      within me to tame the delightful expansiveness proper to that coming hour
      of marriage-bells and bridal-wreaths. It is a sign that the end, and the
      delivery of reader and writer alike, should not be dallied with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess had invited Lucy Heddon to Sarkeld to meet Temple, and Temple
      to meet me. Onward I flew. I saw the old woods of the lake-palace, and, as
      it were, the light of my past passion waning above them. I was greeted by
      the lady of all nobility with her gracious warmth, and in his usual abrupt
      manful fashion by Prince Hermann. And I had no time to reflect on the
      strangeness of my stepping freely under the roof where a husband claimed
      Ottilia, before she led me into the library, where sat my lost and
      recovered, my darling; and, unlike herself, for a moment, she faltered in
      rising and breathing my name.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were alone. I knew she was no bondwoman. The question how it had come
      to pass lurked behind everything I said and did; speculation on the
      visible features, and touching of the unfettered hand, restrained me from
      uttering or caring to utter it. But it was wonderful. It thrust me back on
      Providence again for the explanation&mdash;humbly this time. It was
      wonderful and blessed, as to loving eyes the first-drawn breath of a
      drowned creature restored to life. I kissed her hand. &lsquo;Wait till you have
      heard everything, Harry,&rsquo; she said, and her voice was deeper, softer,
      exquisitely strange in its known tones, as her manner was, and her eyes.
      She was not the blooming, straight-shouldered, high-breathing girl of
      other days, but sister to the day of her &lsquo;Good-bye, Harry,&rsquo; pale and worn.
      The eyes had wept. This was Janet, haply widowed. She wore no garb nor a
      shade of widowhood. Perhaps she had thrown it off, not to offend an
      implacable temper in me. I said, &lsquo;I shall hear nothing that can make you
      other than my own Janet&mdash;if you will?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled a little. &lsquo;We expected Temple&rsquo;s arrival sooner than yours,
      Harry!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you take to his Lucy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, thoroughly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The perfect ring of Janet was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mention of Riversley made her conversation lively, and she gave me
      moderately good news of my father, quaint, out of Julia Bulsted&rsquo;s latest
      letter to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then how long,&rsquo; I asked astonished, &lsquo;how long have you been staying with
      the princess?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered, colouring, &lsquo;So long, that I can speak fairish German.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And read it easily?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have actually taken to reading, Harry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her courage must have quailed, and she must have been looking for me on
      that morning of miserable aspect when I beheld the last of England through
      wailful showers, like the scene of a burial. I did not speak of it,
      fearing to hurt her pride, but said, &lsquo;Have you been here&mdash;months?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, some months,&rsquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Many?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said, and dropped her eyelids, and then, with a quick look at
      me, &lsquo;Wait for Temple, Harry. He is a day behind his time. We can&rsquo;t account
      for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I suggested, half in play, that perhaps he had decided, for the sake of a
      sea voyage, to come by our old route to Germany on board the barque
      Priscilla, with Captain Welsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint shudder passed over her. She shut her eyes and shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our interview satisfied my heart&rsquo;s hunger no further. The Verona&rsquo;s erratic
      voyage had cut me off from letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet might be a widow, for aught I knew. She was always Janet to me; but
      why at liberty? why many months at Sarkeld, the guest of the princess? Was
      she neither maid nor widow&mdash;a wife flown from a brutal husband? or
      separated, and forcibly free? Under such conditions Ottilia would not have
      commanded my return but what was I to imagine? A boiling couple of hours
      divided me from the time for dressing, when, as I meditated, I could put a
      chance question or two to the man commissioned to wait on me, and hear
      whether the English lady was a Fraulein. The Margravine and Prince Ernest
      were absent. Hermann worked in his museum, displaying his treasures to
      Colonel Heddon. I sat with the ladies in the airy look-out tower of the
      lake-palace, a prey to intense speculations, which devoured themselves and
      changed from fire to smoke, while I recounted the adventures of our ship&rsquo;s
      voyage, and they behaved as if there were nothing to tell me in turn, each
      a sphinx holding the secret I thirsted for. I should not certainly have
      thirsted much if Janet had met me as far half-way as a delicate woman may
      advance. The mystery lay in her evident affection, her apparent freedom
      and unfathomable reserve, and her desire that I should see Temple before
      she threw off her feminine armour, to which, judging by the indications,
      Ottilia seemed to me to accede.
    </p>
    <p>
      My old friend was spied first by his sweetheart Lucy, winding dilatorily
      over the hill away from Sarkeld, in one of the carriages sent to meet him.
      He was guilty of wasting a prodigious number of minutes with his trumpery
      &lsquo;How d&rsquo; ye do&rsquo;s,&rsquo; and his glances and excuses, and then I had him up in my
      room, and the tale was told; it was not Temple&rsquo;s fault if he did not begin
      straightforwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I plucked him from his narrator&rsquo;s vexatious and inevitable commencement:
      &lsquo;Temple, tell me, did she go to the altar?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She did? Then she&rsquo;s a widow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, she isn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Temple, distracting me by submitting to the lead I
      distracted him by taking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then her husband&rsquo;s alive?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple denied it, and a devil seized him to perceive some comicality in
      the dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was she married?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple said &lsquo;No,&rsquo; with a lurking drollery about his lips. He added, &lsquo;It &lsquo;s
      nothing to laugh over, Richie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I laughing? Speak out. Did Edbury come to grief overnight in any way?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Temple pronounced a negative, this time wilfully enigmatical: he
      confessed it, and accused me of the provocation. He dashed some laughter
      with gravity to prepare for my next assault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was Edbury the one to throw up the marriage? Did he decline it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; was the answer once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple stopped my wrath by catching at me and begging me to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Edbury was drowned, Richie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Overnight?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, not overnight. I can tell it all in half-a-dozen words, if you&rsquo;ll be
      quiet; and I know you&rsquo;re going to be as happy as I am, or I shouldn&rsquo;t
      trifle an instant. He went overnight on board the barque Priscilla to see
      Mabel Sweetwinter, the only woman he ever could have cared for, and he
      went the voyage, just as we did. He was trapped, caged, and transported;
      it&rsquo;s a repetition, except that the poor old Priscilla never came to land.
      She foundered in a storm in the North Sea. That &lsquo;s all we know. Every soul
      perished, the captain and all. I knew how it would be with that crew of
      his some day or other. Don&rsquo;t you remember my saying the Priscilla was the
      kind of name of a vessel that would go down with all hands, and leave a
      bottle to float to shore? A gin-bottle was found on our East coast-the old
      captain must have discovered in the last few moments that such things were
      on board&mdash;and in it there was a paper, and the passengers&rsquo; and crew&rsquo;s
      names in his handwriting, written as if he had been sitting in his parlour
      at home; over them a line&mdash;&ldquo;The Lord&rsquo;s will is about to be done&rdquo;; and
      underneath&mdash;&ldquo;We go to His judgement resigned and cheerful.&rdquo; You know
      the old captain, Richie?
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple had tears in his eyes. We both stood blinking for a second or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not but be curious to hear the reason for Edbury&rsquo;s having
      determined to sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand how it was, Richie?&rsquo; said Temple. &lsquo;Edbury went to
      persuade her to stay, or just to see her for once, and he came to
      persuasions. He seems to have been succeeding, but the captain stepped on
      board and he treated Edbury as he did us two: he made him take the voyage
      for discipline&rsquo;s sake and &ldquo;his soul&rsquo;s health.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you know all this, Temple?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know your friend Kiomi was one of the party. The captain sent her
      back on shore because he had no room for her. She told us Edbury offered
      bribes of hundreds and thousands for the captain to let him and Mabel go
      off in the boat with Kiomi, and then he took to begging to go alone. He
      tried to rouse the crew. The poor fellow cringed, she says; he threatened
      to swim off. The captain locked him up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My immediate reflections hit on the Bible lessons Edbury must have had to
      swallow, and the gaping of the waters when its truths were suddenly and
      tremendously brought home to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      An odd series of accidents! I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple continued: &lsquo;Heriot held his tongue about it next morning. He was
      one of the guests, though he had sworn he wouldn&rsquo;t go. He said something
      to Janet that betrayed him, for she had not seen him since.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How betrayed him?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said Temple, &lsquo;of course it was Heriot who put Edbury in Kiomi&rsquo;s
      hands. Edbury wouldn&rsquo;t have known of Mabel&rsquo;s sailing, or known the vessel
      she was in, without her help. She led him down to the water and posted him
      in sight before she went to Captain Welsh&rsquo;s; and when you and Captain
      Welsh walked away, Edbury rowed to the Priscilla. Old Heriot is not
      responsible for the consequences. What he supposed was likely enough. He
      thought that Edbury and Mabel were much of a pair, and thought, I suppose,
      that if Edbury saw her he&rsquo;d find he couldn&rsquo;t leave her, and old Lady Kane,
      who managed him, would stand nodding her plumes for nothing at the altar.
      And so she did: and a pretty scene it was. She snatched at the minutes as
      they slipped past twelve like fishes, and snarled at the parson, and would
      have kept him standing till one P.M., if Janet had not turned on her heel.
      The old woman got in front of her to block her way. &ldquo;Ah, Temple,&rdquo; she said
      to me, &ldquo;it would be hard if I could not think I had done all that was due
      to them.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t see her again till she was starting for Germany. And,
      Richie, she thinks you can never forgive her. She wrote me word that the
      princess is of another mind, but her own opinion, she says, is based upon
      knowing you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good heaven! how little!&rsquo; cried I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple did me a further wrong by almost thanking me on Janet&rsquo;s behalf for
      my sustained love for her, while he praised the very qualities of pride
      and a spirited sense of obligation which had reduced her to dread my
      unforgivingness. Yet he and Janet had known me longest. Supposing that my
      idea of myself differed from theirs for the simple reason that I thought
      of what I had grown to be, and they of what I had been through the
      previous years? Did I judge by the flower, and they by root and stem? But
      the flower is a thing of the season; the flower drops off: it may be a
      different development next year. Did they not therefore judge me soundly?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ottilia was the keenest reader. Ottilia had divined what could be wrought
      out of me. I was still subject to the relapses of a not perfectly right
      nature, as I perceived when glancing back at my thought of &lsquo;An odd series
      of accidents!&rsquo; which was but a disguised fashion of attributing to
      Providence the particular concern, in my fortunes: an impiety and a folly!
      This is the temptation of those who are rescued and made happy by
      circumstances. The wretched think themselves spited, and are merely
      childish, not egregious in egoism. Thither on leads to a chapter&mdash;already
      written by the wise, doubtless. It does not become an atom of humanity to
      dwell on it beyond a point where students of the human condition may see
      him passing through the experiences of the flesh and the brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, Temple and I, at two hand-basins, soaped and towelled, and I was
      more discreet toward him than I have been to you, for I reserved from him
      altogether the pronunciation of the council of senators in the secret
      chamber of my head. Whether, indeed, I have fairly painted the outer part
      of myself waxes dubious when I think of his spluttering laugh and shout;
      &lsquo;Richie, you haven&rsquo;t changed a bit&mdash;you&rsquo;re just like a boy!&rsquo; Certain
      indications of external gravity, and a sinking of the natural springs
      within characterized Temple&rsquo;s approach to the responsible position of a
      British husband and father. We talked much of Captain Welsh, and the
      sedate practical irony of his imprisoning one like Edbury to discipline
      him on high seas, as well as the singular situation of the couple of
      culprits under his admonishing regimen, and the tragic end. My next two
      minutes alone with Janet were tempered by it. Only my eagerness for
      another term of privacy persuaded her that I was her lover instead of
      judge, and then, having made the discovery that a single-minded gladness
      animated me in the hope that she and I would travel together one in body
      and soul, she surrendered, with her last bit of pride broken; except, it
      may be, a fragment of reserve traceable in the confession that came
      quaintly after supreme self-blame, when she said she was bound to tell me
      that possibly&mdash;probably, were the trial to come over again, she
      should again act as she had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily for us both, my wits had been sharpened enough to know that there
      is more in men and women than the stuff they utter. And blessed privilege
      now! if the lips were guilty of nonsense, I might stop them. Besides, I
      was soon to be master upon such questions. She admitted it, admitting with
      an unwonted emotional shiver, that absolute freedom could be the worst of
      perils. &lsquo;For women?&rsquo; said I. She preferred to say, &lsquo;For girls,&rsquo; and then
      &lsquo;Yes, for women, as they are educated at present.&rsquo; Spice of the princess&rsquo;s
      conversation flavoured her speech. The signs unfamiliar about her for me
      were marks of the fire she had come out of; the struggle, the torture, the
      determined sacrifice, through pride&rsquo;s conception of duty. She was iron
      once. She had come out of the fire finest steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Riversley! Harry,&rsquo; she murmured, and my smile, and word, and squeeze in
      reply, brought back a whole gleam of the fresh English morning she had
      been in face, and voice, and person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it conceivable that we could go back to Riversley single?
    </p>
    <p>
      Before that was answered she had to make a statement; and in doing it she
      blushed, because it involved Edbury&rsquo;s name, and seemed to involve her
      attachment to him; but she paid me the compliment of speaking it frankly.
      It was that she had felt herself bound in honour to pay Edbury&rsquo;s debts.
      Even by such slight means as her saying, &lsquo;Riversley, Harry,&rsquo; and my kiss
      of her fingers when a question of money was in debate, did we burst aside
      the vestiges of mutual strangeness, and recognize one another, but with an
      added warmth of love. When I pleaded for the marriage to be soon, she
      said, &lsquo;I wish it, Harry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sentiment you do not obtain from a Damascus blade. She most cordially
      despised the ladies who parade and play on their sex, and are for ever
      acting according to the feminine standard:&mdash;a dangerous stretch of
      contempt for one less strong than she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riding behind her and Temple one day with the princess, I said, &lsquo;What
      takes you most in Janet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied, &lsquo;Her courage. And it is of a kind that may knot up every
      other virtue worth having. I have impulses, and am capable of desperation,
      but I have no true courage: so I envy and admire, even if I have to blame
      her; for I know that this possession of hers, which identifies her and
      marks her from the rest of us, would bear the ordeal of fire. I can
      imagine the qualities I have most pride in withering and decaying under a
      prolonged trial. I cannot conceive her courage failing. Perhaps because I
      have it not myself I think it the rarest of precious gifts. It seems to me
      to imply one half, and to dispense with the other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I have lived to think that Ottilia was right. As nearly right, too, in the
      wording of her opinion as one may be in three or four sentences designed
      to be comprehensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Janet&rsquo;s readiness to meet calamity was shown ere we reached home upon
      an evening of the late autumn, and set eye on a scene, for her the very
      saddest that could have been devised to test her spirit of endurance,
      when, driving up the higher heath-land, we saw the dark sky ominously
      reddened over Riversley, and, mounting the ridge, had the funeral flames
      of the old Grange dashed in our faces. The blow was evil, sudden,
      unaccountable. Villagers, tenants, farm-labourers, groups of a deputation
      that had gone to the railway station to give us welcome; and returned,
      owing to a delay in our arrival, stood gazing from all quarters. The
      Grange was burning in two great wings, that soared in flame-tips and
      columns of crimson smoke, leaving the central hall and chambers untouched
      as yet, but alive inside with mysterious ranges of lights, now curtained,
      now made bare&mdash;a feeble contrast to the savage blaze to right and
      left, save for the wonder aroused as to its significance. These were soon
      cloaked. Dead sable reigned in them, and at once a jet of flame gave the
      whole vast building to destruction. My wife thrust her hand in mine. Fire
      at the heart, fire at the wings&mdash;our old home stood in that majesty
      of horror which freezes the limbs of men, bidding them look and no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What has Riversley done to deserve this?&rsquo; I heard Janet murmur to
      herself. &lsquo;His room!&rsquo; she said, when at the South-east wing, where my old
      grandfather had slept, there burst a glut of flame. We dove down to the
      park and along the carriage-road to the first red line of gazers. They
      told us that no living creatures were in the house. My aunt Dorothy was at
      Bulsted. I perceived my father&rsquo;s man Tollingby among the servants, and
      called him to me; others came, and out of a clatter of tongues, and all
      eyes fearfully askant at the wall of fire, we gathered that a great
      reception had been prepared for us by my father: lamps, lights in all the
      rooms, torches in the hall, illuminations along the windows, stores of
      fireworks, such a display as only he could have dreamed of. The fire had
      broken out at dusk, from an explosion of fireworks at one wing and some
      inexplicable mismanagement at the other. But the house must have been like
      a mine, what with the powder, the torches, the devices in paper and
      muslin, and the extraordinary decorations fitted up to celebrate our
      return in harmony with my father&rsquo;s fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gentlemen on horseback dashed up to us. Captain Bulsted seized my hand. He
      was hot from a ride to fetch engines, and sang sharp in my ear, &lsquo;Have you
      got him?&rsquo; It was my father he meant. The cry rose for my father, and the
      groups were agitated and split, and the name of the missing man, without
      an answer to it, shouted. Captain Bulsted had left him bravely attempting
      to quench the flames after the explosion of fireworks. He rode about,
      interrogating the frightened servants and grooms holding horses and dogs.
      They could tell us that the cattle were safe, not a word of my father; and
      amid shrieks of women at fresh falls of timber and ceiling into the pit of
      fire, and warnings from the men, we ran the heated circle of the building
      to find a loophole and offer aid if a living soul should be left; the
      night around us bright as day, busier than day, and a human now added to
      elemental horror. Janet would not quit her place. She sent her
      carriage-horses to Bulsted, and sat in the carriage to see the last of
      burning Riversley. Each time that I came to her she folded her arms on my
      neck and kissed me silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      We gathered from the subsequent testimony of men and women of the
      household who had collected their wits, that my father must have remained
      in the doomed old house to look to the safety of my aunt Dorothy. He was
      never seen again.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; appears, or with which the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
&ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
