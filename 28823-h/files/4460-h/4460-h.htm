    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. THE CHAMPION OF HIS COUNTRY
    </h2>
    <p>
      When young Nevil Beauchamp was throwing off his midshipman&rsquo;s jacket for a
      holiday in the garb of peace, we had across Channel a host of dreadful
      military officers flashing swords at us for some critical observations of
      ours upon their sovereign, threatening Afric&rsquo;s fires and savagery. The
      case occurred in old days now and again, sometimes, upon imagined
      provocation, more furiously than at others. We were unarmed, and the
      spectacle was distressing. We had done nothing except to speak our minds
      according to the habit of the free, and such an explosion appeared as
      irrational and excessive as that of a powder-magazine in reply to nothing
      more than the light of a spark. It was known that a valorous General of
      the Algerian wars proposed to make a clean march to the capital of the
      British Empire at the head of ten thousand men; which seems a small
      quantity to think much about, but they wore wide red breeches blown out by
      Fame, big as her cheeks, and a ten thousand of that sort would never think
      of retreating. Their spectral advance on quaking London through Kentish
      hopgardens, Sussex corn-fields, or by the pleasant hills of Surrey, after
      a gymnastic leap over the riband of salt water, haunted many pillows. And
      now those horrid shouts of the legions of Caesar, crying to the inheritor
      of an invading name to lead them against us, as the origin of his title
      had led the army of Gaul of old gloriously, scared sweet sleep. We saw
      them in imagination lining the opposite shore; eagle and standard-bearers,
      and gallifers, brandishing their fowls and their banners in a manner to
      frighten the decorum of the universe. Where were our men?
    </p>
    <p>
      The returns of the census of our population were oppressively
      satisfactory, and so was the condition of our youth. We could row and ride
      and fish and shoot, and breed largely: we were athletes with a fine
      history and a full purse: we had first-rate sporting guns, unrivalled
      park-hacks and hunters, promising babies to carry on the renown of England
      to the next generation, and a wonderful Press, and a Constitution the
      highest reach of practical human sagacity. But where were our armed men?
      where our great artillery? where our proved captains, to resist a sudden
      sharp trial of the national mettle? Where was the first line of England&rsquo;s
      defence, her navy? These were questions, and Ministers were called upon to
      answer them. The Press answered them boldly, with the appalling statement
      that we had no navy and no army. At the most we could muster a few old
      ships, a couple of experimental vessels of war, and twenty-five thousand
      soldiers indifferently weaponed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were in fact as naked to the Imperial foe as the merely painted
      Britons.
    </p>
    <p>
      This being apprehended, by the aid of our own shortness of figures and the
      agitated images of the red-breeched only waiting the signal to jump and be
      at us, there ensued a curious exhibition that would be termed, in simple
      language, writing to the newspapers, for it took the outward form of
      letters: in reality, it was the deliberate saddling of our ancient
      nightmare of Invasion, putting the postillion on her, and trotting her
      along the high-road with a winding horn to rouse old Panic. Panic we will,
      for the sake of convenience, assume to be of the feminine gender, and a
      spinster, though properly she should be classed with the large mixed race
      of mental and moral neuters which are the bulk of comfortable nations. She
      turned in her bed at first like the sluggard of the venerable hymnist: but
      once fairly awakened, she directed a stare toward the terrific foreign
      contortionists, and became in an instant all stormy nightcap and fingers
      starving for the bell-rope. Forthwith she burst into a series of shrieks,
      howls, and high piercing notes that caused even the parliamentary
      Opposition, in the heat of an assault on a parsimonious Government, to
      abandon its temporary advantage and be still awhile. Yet she likewise
      performed her part with a certain deliberation and method, as if aware
      that it was a part she had to play in the composition of a singular
      people. She did a little mischief by dropping on the stock-markets; in
      other respects she was harmless, and, inasmuch as she established a
      subject for conversation, useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, lest she should have been taken too seriously, the Press, which had
      kindled, proceeded to extinguish her with the formidable engines called
      leading articles, which fling fire or water, as the occasion may require.
      It turned out that we had ships ready for launching, and certain regiments
      coming home from India; hedges we had, and a spirited body of yeomanry;
      and we had pluck and patriotism, the father and mother of volunteers
      innumerable. Things were not so bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Panic, however, sent up a plaintive whine. What country had anything like
      our treasures to defend? countless riches, beautiful women, an inviolate
      soil! True, and it must be done. Ministers were authoritatively summoned
      to set to work immediately. They replied that they had been at work all
      the time, and were at work now. They could assure the country, that though
      they flourished no trumpets, they positively guaranteed the safety of our
      virgins and coffers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the people, rather ashamed, abused the Press for unreasonably
      disturbing them. The Press attacked old Panic and stripped her naked.
      Panic, with a desolate scream, arraigned the parliamentary Opposition for
      having inflated her to serve base party purposes. The Opposition
      challenged the allegations of Government, pointed to the trimness of army
      and navy during its term of office, and proclaimed itself watch-dog of the
      country, which is at all events an office of a kind. Hereupon the
      ambassador of yonder ireful soldiery let fall a word, saying, by the faith
      of his Master, there was no necessity for watch-dogs to bark; an ardent
      and a reverent army had but fancied its beloved chosen Chief insulted; the
      Chief and chosen held them in; he, despite obloquy, discerned our merits
      and esteemed us.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, then, Panic, or what remained of her, was put to bed again. The
      Opposition retired into its kennel growling. The People coughed like a man
      of two minds, doubting whether he has been divinely inspired or has cut a
      ridiculous figure. The Press interpreted the cough as a warning to
      Government; and Government launched a big ship with hurrahs, and ordered
      the recruiting-sergeant to be seen conspicuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus we obtained a moderate reinforcement of our arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not arrived at by connivance all round, though there was a look of
      it. Certainly it did not come of accident, though there was a look of that
      as well. Nor do we explain much of the secret by attributing it to the
      working of a complex machinery. The housewife&rsquo;s remedy of a good shaking
      for the invalid who will not arise and dance away his gout, partly
      illustrates the action of the Press upon the country: and perhaps the
      country shaken may suffer a comparison with the family chariot of the last
      century, built in a previous one, commodious, furnished agreeably, being
      all that the inside occupants could require of a conveyance, until the
      report of horsemen crossing the heath at a gallop sets it dishonourably
      creaking and complaining in rapid motion, and the squire curses his
      miserly purse that would not hire a guard, and his dame says, I told you
      so!&mdash;Foolhardy man, to suppose, because we have constables in the
      streets of big cities, we have dismissed the highwayman to limbo. And here
      he is, and he will cost you fifty times the sum you would have laid out to
      keep him at a mile&rsquo;s respectful distance! But see, the wretch is bowing:
      he smiles at our carriage, and tells the coachman that he remembers he has
      been our guest, and really thinks we need not go so fast. He leaves word
      for you, sir, on your peril to denounce him on another occasion from the
      magisterial Bench, for that albeit he is a gentleman of the road, he has a
      mission to right society, and succeeds legitimately to that bold Good
      Robin Hood who fed the poor.&mdash;Fresh from this polite encounter, the
      squire vows money for his personal protection: and he determines to speak
      his opinion of Sherwood&rsquo;s latest captain as loudly as ever. That he will,
      I do not say. It might involve a large sum per annum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similes are very well in their way. None can be sufficient in this case
      without levelling a finger at the taxpayer&mdash;nay, directly mentioning
      him. He is the key of our ingenuity. He pays his dues; he will not pay the
      additional penny or two wanted of him, that we may be a step or two ahead
      of the day we live in, unless he is frightened. But scarcely anything less
      than the wild alarum of a tocsin will frighten him. Consequently the
      tocsin has to be sounded; and the effect is woeful past measure: his
      hugging of his army, his kneeling on the shore to his navy, his
      implorations of his yeomanry and his hedges, are sad to note. His bursts
      of pot-valiancy (the male side of the maiden Panic within his bosom) are
      awful to his friends. Particular care must be taken after he has begun to
      cool and calculate his chances of security, that he do not gather to him a
      curtain of volunteers and go to sleep again behind them; for they cost
      little in proportion to the much they pretend to be to him. Patriotic
      taxpayers doubtless exist: prophetic ones, provident ones, do not. At
      least we show that we are wanting in them. The taxpayer of a free land
      taxes himself, and his disinclination for the bitter task, save under
      circumstances of screaming urgency&mdash;as when the night-gear and
      bed-linen of old convulsed Panic are like the churned Channel sea in the
      track of two hundred hostile steamboats, let me say&mdash;is of the kind
      the gentle schoolboy feels when death or an expedition has relieved him of
      his tyrant, and he is entreated notwithstanding to go to his books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will you not own that the working of the system for scaring him and
      bleeding is very ingenious? But whether the ingenuity comes of native
      sagacity, as it is averred by some, or whether it shows an instinct
      labouring to supply the deficiencies of stupidity, according to others, I
      cannot express an opinion. I give you the position of the country
      undisturbed by any moralizings of mine. The youth I introduce to you will
      rarely let us escape from it; for the reason that he was born with so
      extreme and passionate a love for his country, that he thought all things
      else of mean importance in comparison: and our union is one in which,
      following the counsel of a sage and seer, I must try to paint for you what
      is, not that which I imagine. This day, this hour, this life, and even
      politics, the centre and throbbing heart of it (enough, when unburlesqued,
      to blow the down off the gossamer-stump of fiction at a single breath, I
      have heard tell), must be treated of men, and the ideas of men, which are&mdash;it
      is policy to be emphatic upon truisms&mdash;are actually the motives of
      men in a greater degree than their appetites: these are my theme; and may
      it be my fortune to keep them at bloodheat, and myself calm as a statue of
      Memnon in prostrate Egypt! He sits there waiting for the sunlight; I here,
      and readier to be musical than you think. I can at any rate be impartial;
      and do but fix your eyes on the sunlight striking him and swallowing the
      day in rounding him, and you have an image of the passive receptivity of
      shine and shade I hold it good to aim at, if at the same time I may keep
      my characters at blood-heat. I shoot my arrows at a mark that is pretty
      certain to return them to me. And as to perfect success, I should be like
      the panic-stricken shopkeepers in my alarm at it; for I should believe
      that genii of the air fly above our tree-tops between us and the
      incognizable spheres, catching those ambitious shafts they deem it a
      promise of fun to play pranks with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. Beauchamp at that period of the panic had not the slightest
      feeling for the taxpayer. He was therefore unable to penetrate the mystery
      of our roundabout way of enlivening him. He pored over the journals in
      perplexity, and talked of his indignation nightly to his pretty partners
      at balls, who knew not they were lesser Andromedas of his dear Andromeda
      country, but danced and chatted and were gay, and said they were sure he
      would defend them. The men he addressed were civil. They listened to him,
      sometimes with smiles and sometimes with laughter, but approvingly, liking
      the lad&rsquo;s quick spirit. They were accustomed to the machinery employed to
      give our land a shudder and to soothe it, and generally remarked that it
      meant nothing. His uncle Everard, and his uncle&rsquo;s friend Stukely Culbrett,
      expounded the nature of Frenchmen to him, saying that they were uneasy
      when not periodically thrashed; it would be cruel to deny them their crow
      beforehand; and so the pair of gentlemen pooh-poohed the affair; agreeing
      with him, however, that we had no great reason to be proud of our
      appearance, and the grounds they assigned for this were the activity and
      the prevalence of the ignoble doctrines of Manchester&mdash;a power whose
      very existence was unknown to Mr. Beauchamp. He would by no means allow
      the burden of our national disgrace to be cast on one part of the nation.
      We were insulted, and all in a poultry-flutter, yet no one seemed to feel
      it but himself! Outside the Press and Parliament, which must necessarily
      be the face we show to the foreigner, absolute indifference reigned. Navy
      men and red-coats were willing to join him or anybody in sneers at a
      clipping and paring miserly Government, but they were insensible to the
      insult, the panic, the startled-poultry show, the shame of our exhibition
      of ourselves in Europe. It looked as if the blustering French Guard were
      to have it all their own way. And what would they, what could they but,
      think of us! He sat down to write them a challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is not the only Englishman who has been impelled by a youthful chivalry
      to do that. He is perhaps the youngest who ever did it, and consequently
      there were various difficulties to be overcome. As regards his
      qualifications for addressing Frenchmen, a year of his prae-neptunal time
      had been spent in their capital city for the purpose of acquiring French
      of Paris, its latest refinements of pronunciation and polish, and the art
      of conversing. He had read the French tragic poets and Moliere; he could
      even relish the Gallic-classic&mdash;&lsquo;Qu&rsquo;il mourut!&rsquo; and he spoke French
      passably, being quite beyond the Bullish treatment of the tongue. Writing
      a letter in French was a different undertaking. The one he projected bore
      no resemblance to an ordinary letter. The briefer the better, of course;
      but a tone of dignity was imperative, and the tone must be individual,
      distinctive, Nevil Beauchamp&rsquo;s, though not in his native language. First
      he tried his letter in French, and lost sight of himself completely.
      &lsquo;Messieurs de la Garde Francaise,&rsquo; was a good beginning; the remainder
      gave him a false air of a masquerader, most uncomfortable to see; it was
      Nevil Beauchamp in moustache and imperial, and bagbreeches badly fitting.
      He tried English, which was really himself, and all that heart could
      desire, supposing he addressed a body of midshipmen just a little loftily.
      But the English, when translated, was bald and blunt to the verge of
      offensiveness.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;GENTLEMEN OF THE FRENCH GUARD,

   &lsquo;I take up the glove you have tossed us. I am an Englishman.
   That will do for a reason.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      This might possibly pass with the gentlemen of the English Guard. But
      read:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;MESSIEURS DE LA GARDE FRANCAISE,

   &lsquo;J&rsquo;accepte votre gant. Je suis Anglais. La raison est suffisante.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      And imagine French Guardsmen reading it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beauchamp knew the virtue of punctiliousness in epithets and phrases
      of courtesy toward a formal people, and as the officers of the French
      Guard were gentlemen of birth, he would have them to perceive in him their
      equal at a glance. On the other hand, a bare excess of phrasing distorted
      him to a likeness of Mascarille playing Marquis. How to be English and
      think French! The business was as laborious as if he had started on the
      rough sea of the Channel to get at them in an open boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady governing his uncle Everard&rsquo;s house, Mrs. Rosamund Culling,
      entered his room and found him writing with knitted brows. She was young,
      that is, she was not in her middleage; and they were the dearest of
      friends; each had given the other proof of it. Nevil looked up and beheld
      her lifted finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are composing a love-letter, Nevil!&rsquo; The accusation sounded like
      irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said he, puffing; &lsquo;I wish I were!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What can it be, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He thrust pen and paper a hand&rsquo;s length on the table, and gazed at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Nevil, is it really anything serious?&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am writing French, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I may help you. It must be very absorbing, for you did not hear my
      knock at your door.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, could he trust her? The widow of a British officer killed nobly
      fighting for his country in India, was a person to be relied on for active
      and burning sympathy in a matter that touched the country&rsquo;s honour. She
      was a woman, and a woman of spirit. Men had not pleased him of late.
      Something might be hoped from a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stated his occupation, saying that if she would assist him in his
      French she would oblige him; the letter must be written and must go. This
      was uttered so positively that she bowed her head, amused by the funny
      semi-tone of defiance to the person to whom he confided the secret. She
      had humour, and was ravished by his English boyishness, with the novel
      blush of the heroical-nonsensical in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Culling promised him demurely that she would listen, objecting
      nothing to his plan, only to his French.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Messieurs de la Garde Francaise!&rsquo; he commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her criticism followed swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you are writing to the Garde Imperiale.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He admitted his error, and thanked her warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Messieurs de la Garde Imperiale!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does not that,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;include the non-commissioned officers, the
      privates, and the cooks, of all the regiments?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He could scarcely think that, but thought it provoking the French had no
      distinctive working title corresponding to gentlemen, and suggested
      &lsquo;Messieurs les Officiers&rsquo;: which might, Mrs. Culling assured him, comprise
      the barbers. He frowned, and she prescribed his writing, &lsquo;Messieurs les
      Colonels de la Garde Imperiale.&rsquo; This he set down. The point was that a
      stand must be made against the flood of sarcasms and bullyings to which
      the country was exposed in increasing degrees, under a belief that we
      would fight neither in the mass nor individually. Possibly, if it became
      known that the colonels refused to meet a midshipman, the gentlemen of our
      Household troops would advance a step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Calling&rsquo;s adroit efforts to weary him out of his project were
      unsuccessful. He was too much on fire to know the taste of absurdity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevil repeated what he had written in French, and next the English of what
      he intended to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady conscientiously did her utmost to reconcile the two languages.
      She softened his downrightness, passed with approval his compliments to
      France and the ancient high reputation of her army, and, seeing that a
      loophole was left for them to apologize, asked how many French colonels he
      wanted to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not WANT, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Nevil.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had simply taken up the glove they had again flung at our feet: and he
      had done it to stop the incessant revilings, little short of positive
      contempt, which we in our indolence exposed ourselves to from the
      foreigner, particularly from Frenchmen, whom he liked; and precisely
      because he liked them he insisted on forcing them to respect us. Let his
      challenge be accepted, and he would find backers. He knew the stuff of
      Englishmen: they only required an example.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;French officers are skilful swordsmen,&rsquo; said Mrs. Culling. &lsquo;My husband
      has told me they will spend hours of the day thrusting and parrying. They
      are used to duelling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We,&rsquo; Nevil answered, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t get apprenticed to the shambles to learn our
      duty on the field. Duelling is, I know, sickening folly. We go too far in
      pretending to despise every insult pitched at us. A man may do for his
      country what he wouldn&rsquo;t do for himself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Culling gravely said she hoped that bloodshed would be avoided, and
      Mr. Beauchamp nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She left him hard at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a popular boy, a favourite of women, and therefore full of
      engagements to Balls and dinners. And he was a modest boy, though his
      uncle encouraged him to deliver his opinions freely and argue with men.
      The little drummer attached to wheeling columns thinks not more of himself
      because his short legs perform the same strides as the grenadiers&rsquo;; he is
      happy to be able to keep the step; and so was Nevil; and if ever he
      contradicted a senior, it was in the interests of the country. Veneration
      of heroes, living and dead, kept down his conceit. He worshipped
      devotedly. From an early age he exacted of his flattering ladies that they
      must love his hero. Not to love his hero was to be strangely in error, to
      be in need of conversion, and he proselytized with the ardour of the
      Moslem. His uncle Everard was proud of his good looks, fire, and nonsense,
      during the boy&rsquo;s extreme youth. He traced him by cousinships back to the
      great Earl Beauchamp of Froissart, and would have it so; and he would have
      spoilt him had not the young fellow&rsquo;s mind been possessed by his reverence
      for men of deeds. How could he think of himself, who had done nothing,
      accomplished nothing, so long as he brooded on the images of signal
      Englishmen whose names were historic for daring, and the strong arm, and
      artfulness, all given to the service of the country?&mdash;men of a
      magnanimity overcast with simplicity, which Nevil held to be pure insular
      English; our type of splendid manhood, not discoverable elsewhere. A
      method of enraging him was to distinguish one or other of them as Irish,
      Scottish, or Cambrian. He considered it a dismemberment of the country.
      And notwithstanding the pleasure he had in uniting in his person the
      strong red blood of the chivalrous Lord Beauchamp with the hard and
      tenacious Romfrey blood, he hated the title of Norman. We are English&mdash;British,
      he said. A family resting its pride on mere ancestry provoked his
      contempt, if it did not show him one of his men. He had also a disposition
      to esteem lightly the family which, having produced a man, settled down
      after that effort for generations to enjoy the country&rsquo;s pay. Boys are
      unjust; but Nevil thought of the country mainly, arguing that we should
      not accept the country&rsquo;s money for what we do not ourselves perform. These
      traits of his were regarded as characteristics hopeful rather than the
      reverse; none of his friends and relatives foresaw danger in them. He was
      a capital boy for his elders to trot out and banter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rosamund Culling usually went to his room to see him and doat on him
      before he started on his rounds of an evening. She suspected that his
      necessary attention to his toilet would barely have allowed him time to
      finish his copy of the letter. Certain phrases had bothered him. The
      thrice recurrence of &lsquo;ma patrie&rsquo; jarred on his ear. &lsquo;Sentiments&rsquo; afflicted
      his acute sense of the declamatory twice. &lsquo;C&rsquo;est avec les sentiments du
      plus profond regret&rsquo;: and again, &lsquo;Je suis bien scar que vous comprendrez
      mes sentiments, et m&rsquo;accorderez l&rsquo;honneur que je reclame au nom de ma
      patrie outrage.&rsquo; The word &lsquo;patrie&rsquo; was broadcast over the letter, and
      &lsquo;honneur&rsquo; appeared four times, and a more delicate word to harp on than
      the others!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not to Frenchmen,&rsquo; said his friend Rosamund. &lsquo;I would put &ldquo;Je suis
      convaincu&rdquo;: it is not so familiar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I have written out the fair copy, ma&rsquo;am, and that alteration seems a
      trifle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would copy it again and again, Nevil, to get it right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No: I&rsquo;d rather see it off than have it right,&rsquo; said Nevil, and he folded
      the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the deuce to address it, and what direction to write on it, were
      further difficulties. He had half a mind to remain at home to conquer them
      by excogitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund urged him not to break his engagement to dine at the Halketts&rsquo;,
      where perhaps from his friend Colonel Halkett, who would never imagine the
      reason for the inquiry, he might learn how a letter to a crack French
      regiment should be addressed and directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This proved persuasive, and as the hour was late Nevil had to act on her
      advice in a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      His uncle Everard enjoyed a perusal of the manuscript in his absence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. UNCLE, NEPHEW, AND ANOTHER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Honourable Everard Romfrey came of a race of fighting earls, toughest
      of men, whose high, stout, Western castle had weathered our cyclone
      periods of history without changeing hands more than once, and then but
      for a short year or two, as if to teach the original possessors the wisdom
      of inclining to the stronger side. They had a queen&rsquo;s chamber in it, and a
      king&rsquo;s; and they stood well up against the charge of having dealt darkly
      with the king. He died among them&mdash;how has not been told. We will not
      discuss the conjectures here. A savour of North Sea foam and ballad
      pirates hangs about the early chronicles of the family. Indications of an
      ancestry that had lived between the wave and the cloud were discernible in
      their notions of right and wrong. But a settlement on solid earth has its
      influences. They were chivalrous knights bannerets, and leaders in the
      tented field, paying and taking fair ransom for captures; and they were
      good landlords, good masters blithely followed to the wars. Sing an old
      battle of Normandy, Picardy, Gascony, and you celebrate deeds of theirs.
      At home they were vexatious neighbours to a town of burghers claiming
      privileges: nor was it unreasonable that the Earl should flout the
      pretensions of the town to read things for themselves, documents,
      titleships, rights, and the rest. As well might the flat plain boast of
      seeing as far as the pillar. Earl and town fought the fight of Barons and
      Commons in epitome. The Earl gave way; the Barons gave way. Mighty men may
      thrash numbers for a time; in the end the numbers will be thrashed into
      the art of beating their teachers. It is bad policy to fight the odds inch
      by inch. Those primitive school masters of the million liked it, and took
      their pleasure in that way. The Romfreys did not breed warriors for a
      parade at Court; wars, though frequent, were not constant, and they wanted
      occupation: they may even have felt that they were bound in no common
      degree to the pursuit of an answer to what may be called the parent
      question of humanity: Am I thy master, or thou mine? They put it to lords
      of other castles, to town corporations, and sometimes brother to brother:
      and notwithstanding that the answer often unseated and once discastled
      them, they swam back to their places, as born warriors, urged by a passion
      for land, are almost sure to do; are indeed quite sure, so long as they
      multiply sturdily, and will never take no from Fortune. A family passion
      for land, that survives a generation, is as effective as genius in
      producing the object it conceives; and through marriages and conflicts,
      the seizure of lands, and brides bearing land, these sharp-feeding
      eagle-eyed earls of Romfrey spied few spots within their top tower&rsquo;s wide
      circle of the heavens not their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is therefore manifest that they had the root qualities, the prime
      active elements, of men in perfection, and notably that appetite to
      flourish at the cost of the weaker, which is the blessed exemplification
      of strength, and has been man&rsquo;s cheerfulest encouragement to fight on
      since his comparative subjugation (on the whole, it seems complete) of the
      animal world. By-and-by the struggle is transferred to higher ground, and
      we begin to perceive how much we are indebted to the fighting spirit.
      Strength is the brute form of truth. No conspicuously great man was born
      of the Romfreys, who were better served by a succession of able sons. They
      sent undistinguished able men to army and navy&mdash;lieutenants given to
      be critics of their captains, but trustworthy for their work. In the later
      life of the family, they preferred the provincial state of splendid
      squires to Court and political honours. They were renowned shots,
      long-limbed stalking sportsmen in field and bower, fast friends,
      intemperate enemies, handsome to feminine eyes, resembling one another in
      build, and mostly of the Northern colour, or betwixt the tints, with an
      hereditary nose and mouth that cried Romfrey from faces thrice diluted in
      cousinships.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hon. Everard (Stephen Denely Craven Romfrey), third son of the late
      Earl, had some hopes of the title, and was in person a noticeable
      gentleman, in mind a mediaeval baron, in politics a crotchety
      unintelligible Whig. He inherited the estate of Holdesbury, on the borders
      of Hampshire and Wilts, and espoused that of Steynham in Sussex, where he
      generally resided. His favourite in the family had been the Lady Emily,
      his eldest sister, who, contrary to the advice of her other brothers and
      sisters, had yielded her hand to his not wealthy friend, Colonel Richard
      Beauchamp. After the death of Nevil&rsquo;s parents, he adopted the boy, being
      himself childless, and a widower. Childlessness was the affliction of the
      family. Everard, having no son, could hardly hope that his brother the
      Earl, and Craven, Lord Avonley, would have one, for he loved the prospect
      of the title. Yet, as there were no cousins of the male branch extant, the
      lack of an heir was a serious omission, and to become the Earl of Romfrey,
      and be the last Earl of Romfrey, was a melancholy thought, however
      brilliant. So sinks the sun: but he could not desire the end of a great
      day. At one time he was a hot Parliamentarian, calling himself a Whig,
      called by the Whigs a Radical, called by the Radicals a Tory, and very
      happy in fighting them all round. This was during the decay of his party,
      before the Liberals were defined. A Liberal deprived him of the seat he
      had held for fifteen years, and the clearness of his understanding was
      obscured by that black vision of popular ingratitude which afflicts the
      free fighting man yet more than the malleable public servant. The latter
      has a clerkly humility attached to him like a second nature, from his
      habit of doing as others bid him: the former smacks a voluntarily sweating
      forehead and throbbing wounds for witness of his claim upon your palpable
      thankfulness. It is an insult to tell him that he fought for his own
      satisfaction. Mr. Romfrey still called himself a Whig, though it was Whig
      mean vengeance on account of his erratic vote and voice on two or three
      occasions that denied him a peerage and a seat in haven. Thither let your
      good sheep go, your echoes, your wag-tail dogs, your wealthy pursy
      manufacturers! He decried the attractions of the sublimer House, and
      laughed at the transparent Whiggery of his party in replenishing it from
      the upper shoots of the commonalty: &lsquo;Dragging it down to prop it up!
      swamping it to keep it swimming!&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was nevertheless a vehement supporter of that House. He stood for King,
      Lords, and Commons, in spite of his personal grievances, harping the triad
      as vigorously as bard of old Britain. Commons he added out of courtesy, or
      from usage or policy, or for emphasis, or for the sake of the
      Constitutional number of the Estates of the realm, or it was because he
      had an intuition of the folly of omitting them; the same, to some extent,
      that builders have regarding bricks when they plan a fabric. Thus,
      although King and Lords prove the existence of Commons in days of the
      political deluge almost syllogistically, the example of not including one
      of the Estates might be imitated, and Commons and King do not necessitate
      the conception of an intermediate third, while Lords and Commons suggest
      the decapitation of the leading figure. The united three, however, no
      longer cast reflections on one another, and were an assurance to this
      acute politician that his birds were safe. He preserved game rigorously,
      and the deduction was the work of instinct with him. To his mind the
      game-laws were the corner-stone of Law, and of a man&rsquo;s right to hold his
      own; and so delicately did he think the country poised, that an attack on
      them threatened the structure of justice. The three conjoined Estates were
      therefore his head gamekeepers; their duty was to back him against the
      poacher, if they would not see the country tumble. As to his
      under-gamekeepers, he was their intimate and their friend, saying, with
      none of the misanthropy which proclaims the virtues of the faithful dog to
      the confusion of humankind, he liked their company better than that of his
      equals, and learnt more from them. They also listened deferentially to
      their instructor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation he delighted in most might have been going on in any
      century since the Conquest. Grant him his not unreasonable argument upon
      his property in game, he was a liberal landlord. No tenants were forced to
      take his farms. He dragged none by the collar. He gave them liberty to go
      to Australia, Canada, the Americas, if they liked. He asked in return to
      have the liberty to shoot on his own grounds, and rear the marks for his
      shot, treating the question of indemnification as a gentleman should.
      Still there were grumbling tenants. He swarmed with game, and, though he
      was liberal, his hares and his birds were immensely destructive:
      computation could not fix the damage done by them. Probably the farmers
      expected them not to eat. &lsquo;There are two parties to a bargain,&rsquo; said
      Everard, &lsquo;and one gets the worst of it. But if he was never obliged to
      make it, where&rsquo;s his right to complain?&rsquo; Men of sense rarely obtain
      satisfactory answers: they are provoked to despise their kind. But the
      poacher was another kind of vermin than the stupid tenant. Everard did him
      the honour to hate him, and twice in a fray had he collared his ruffian,
      and subsequently sat in condemnation of the wretch: for he who can attest
      a villany is best qualified to punish it. Gangs from the metropolis found
      him too determined and alert for their sport. It was the factiousness of
      here and there an unbroken young scoundrelly colt poacher of the
      neighbourhood, a born thief, a fellow damned in an inveterate taste for
      game, which gave him annoyance. One night he took Master Nevil out with
      him, and they hunted down a couple of sinners that showed fight against
      odds. Nevil attempted to beg them off because of their boldness. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
      set my traps for nothing,&rsquo; said his uncle, silencing him. But the boy
      reflected that his uncle was perpetually lamenting the cowed spirit of the
      common English-formerly such fresh and merry men! He touched Rosamund
      Culling&rsquo;s heart with his description of their attitudes when they stood
      resisting and bawling to the keepers, &lsquo;Come on we&rsquo;ll die for it.&rsquo; They did
      not die. Everard explained to the boy that he could have killed them, and
      was contented to have sent them to gaol for a few weeks. Nevil gaped at
      the empty magnanimity which his uncle presented to him as a remarkably big
      morsel. At the age of fourteen he was despatched to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went unwillingly; not so much from an objection to a naval life as from
      a wish, incomprehensible to grown men and boys, and especially to his
      cousin, Cecil Baskelett, that he might remain at school and learn. &lsquo;The
      fellow would like to be a parson!&rsquo; Everard said in disgust. No parson had
      ever been known of in the Romfrey family, or in the Beauchamp. A legend of
      a parson that had been a tutor in one of the Romfrey houses, and had
      talked and sung blandly to a damsel of the blood&mdash;degenerate maid&mdash;to
      receive a handsome trouncing for his pains, instead of the holy
      marriage-tie he aimed at, was the only connection of the Romfreys with the
      parsonry, as Everard called them. He attributed the boy&rsquo;s feeling to the
      influence of his great-aunt Beauchamp, who would, he said, infallibly have
      made a parson of him. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather enlist for a soldier,&rsquo; Nevil said, and
      he ceased to dream of rebellion, and of his little property of a few
      thousand pounds in the funds to aid him in it. He confessed to his dear
      friend Rosamund Culling that he thought the parsons happy in having time
      to read history. And oh, to feel for certain which side was the wrong side
      in our Civil War, so that one should not hesitate in choosing! Such
      puzzles are never, he seemed to be aware, solved in a midshipman&rsquo;s mess.
      He hated bloodshed, and was guilty of the &lsquo;cotton-spinners&rsquo; babble,&rsquo; 
      abhorred of Everard, in alluding to it. Rosamund liked him for his
      humanity; but she, too, feared he was a slack Romfrey when she heard him
      speak in precocious contempt of glory. Somewhere, somehow, he had got hold
      of Manchester sarcasms concerning glory: a weedy word of the newspapers
      had been sown in his bosom perhaps. He said: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care to win glory; I
      know all about that; I &lsquo;ve seen an old hat in the Louvre.&rsquo; And he would
      have had her to suppose that he had looked on the campaigning head-cover
      of Napoleon simply as a shocking bad, bald, brown-rubbed old tricorne
      rather than as the nod of extinction to thousands, the great orb of
      darkness, the still-trembling gloomy quiver&mdash;the brain of the
      lightnings of battles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this boy nursed no secret presumptuous belief that he was fitted for
      the walks of the higher intellect; he was not having his impudent boy&rsquo;s
      fling at superiority over the superior, as here and there a subtle-minded
      vain juvenile will; nor was he a parrot repeating a line from some
      Lancastrian pamphlet. He really disliked war and the sword; and scorning
      the prospect of an idle life, confessing that his abilities barely adapted
      him for a sailor&rsquo;s, he was opposed to the career opened to him almost to
      the extreme of shrinking and terror. Or that was the impression conveyed
      to a not unsympathetic hearer by his forlorn efforts to make himself
      understood, which were like the tappings of the stick of a blind man
      mystified by his sense of touch at wrong corners. His bewilderment and
      speechlessness were a comic display, tragic to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as his uncle Everard predicted, he came home from his first voyage a
      pleasant sailor lad. His features, more than handsome to a woman, so
      mobile they were, shone of sea and spirit, the chance lights of the sea,
      and the spirit breathing out of it. As to war and bloodshed, a man&rsquo;s first
      thought must be his country, young Jacket remarked, and &lsquo;Ich dien&rsquo; was the
      best motto afloat. Rosamund noticed the peculiarity of the books he
      selected for his private reading. They were not boys&rsquo; books, books of
      adventure and the like. His favourite author was one writing of Heroes, in
      (so she esteemed it) a style resembling either early architecture or utter
      dilapidation, so loose and rough it seemed; a wind-in-the-orchard style,
      that tumbled down here and there an appreciable fruit with uncouth
      bluster; sentences without commencements running to abrupt endings and
      smoke, like waves against a sea-wall, learned dictionary words giving a
      hand to street-slang, and accents falling on them haphazard, like slant
      rays from driving clouds; all the pages in a breeze, the whole book
      producing a kind of electrical agitation in the mind and the joints. This
      was its effect on the lady. To her the incomprehensible was the
      abominable, for she had our country&rsquo;s high critical feeling; but he, while
      admitting that he could not quite master it, liked it. He had dug the book
      out of a bookseller&rsquo;s shop in Malta, captivated by its title, and had,
      since the day of his purchase, gone at it again and again, getting nibbles
      of golden meaning by instalments, as with a solitary pick in a very dark
      mine, until the illumination of an idea struck him that there was a great
      deal more in the book than there was in himself. This was sufficient to
      secure the devoted attachment of young Mr. Beauchamp. Rosamund sighed with
      apprehension to think of his unlikeness to boys and men among his
      countrymen in some things. Why should he hug a book he owned he could not
      quite comprehend? He said he liked a bone in his mouth; and it was natural
      wisdom, though unappreciated by women. A bone in a boy&rsquo;s mind for him to
      gnaw and worry, corrects the vagrancies and promotes the healthy
      activities, whether there be marrow in it or not. Supposing it furnishes
      only dramatic entertainment in that usually vacant tenement, or
      powder-shell, it will be of service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevil proposed to her that her next present should be the entire list of
      his beloved Incomprehensible&rsquo;s published works, and she promised, and was
      not sorry to keep her promise dangling at the skirts of memory, to drop
      away in time. For that fire-and-smoke writer dedicated volumes to the
      praise of a regicide. Nice reading for her dear boy! Some weeks after
      Nevil was off again, she abused herself for her half-hearted love of him,
      and would have given him anything&mdash;the last word in favour of the
      Country versus the royal Martyr, for example, had he insisted on it. She
      gathered, bit by bit, that he had dashed at his big blustering cousin
      Cecil to vindicate her good name. The direful youths fought in the
      Steynham stables, overheard by the grooms. Everard received a fine account
      of the tussle from these latter, and Rosamund, knowing him to be of the
      order of gentlemen who, whatsoever their sins, will at all costs protect a
      woman&rsquo;s delicacy, and a dependant&rsquo;s, man or woman, did not fear to have
      her ears shocked in probing him on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everard was led to say that Nevil&rsquo;s cousins were bedevilled with
      womanfolk.
    </p>
    <p>
      From which Rosamund perceived that women had been at work; and if so, it
      was upon the business of the scandal-monger; and if so, Nevil fought his
      cousin to protect her good name from a babbler of the family gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke to Stukely Culbrett, her dead husband&rsquo;s friend, to whose
      recommendation she was indebted for her place in Everard Romfrey&rsquo;s
      household.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil behaved like a knight, I hear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your beauty was disputed,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and Nevil knocked the blind man down
      for not being able to see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought, &lsquo;Not my beauty! Nevil struck his cousin on behalf of the only
      fair thing I have left to me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a moment with her when many sensations rush together and form a
      knot in sensitive natures. She had been very good-looking. She was
      good-looking still, but she remembered the bloom of her looks in her
      husband&rsquo;s days (the tragedy of the mirror is one for a woman to write: I
      am ashamed to find myself smiling while the poor lady weeps), she
      remembered his praises, her pride; his death in battle, her anguish: then,
      on her strange entry to this house, her bitter wish to be older; and then,
      the oppressive calm of her recognition of her wish&rsquo;s fulfilment, the heavy
      drop to dead earth, when she could say, or pretend to think she could say&mdash;I
      look old enough: will they tattle of me now? Nevil&rsquo;s championship of her
      good name brought her history spinning about her head, and threw a finger
      of light on her real position. In that she saw the slenderness of her hold
      on respect, as well as felt her personal stainlessness. The boy warmed her
      chill widowhood. It was written that her, second love should be of the
      pattern of mother&rsquo;s love. She loved him hungrily and jealously, always in
      fear for him when he was absent, even anxiously when she had him near. For
      some cause, born, one may fancy, of the hour of her love&rsquo;s conception, his
      image in her heart was steeped in tears. She was not, happily, one of the
      women who betray strong feeling, and humour preserved her from excesses of
      sentiment.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. CONTAINS BARONIAL VIEWS OF THE PRESENT TIME
    </h2>
    <p>
      Upon the word of honour of Rosamund, the letter to the officers of the
      French Guard was posted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Post it, post it,&rsquo; Everard said, on her consulting him, with the letter
      in her hand. &lsquo;Let the fellow stand his luck.&rsquo; It was addressed to the
      Colonel of the First Regiment of the Imperial Guard, Paris. That
      superscription had been suggested by Colonel Halkett. Rosamund was in
      favour of addressing it to Versailles, Nevil to the Tuileries; but Paris
      could hardly fail to hit the mark, and Nevil waited for the reply, half
      expecting an appointment on the French sands: for the act of posting a
      letter, though it be to little short of the Pleiades even, will stamp an
      incredible proceeding as a matter of business, so ready is the ardent mind
      to take footing on the last thing done. The flight of Mr. Beauchamp&rsquo;s
      letter placed it in the common order of occurrences for the youthful
      author of it. Jack Wilmore, a messmate, offered to second him, though he
      should be dismissed the service for it. Another second would easily be
      found somewhere; for, as Nevil observed, you have only to set these
      affairs going, and British blood rises: we are not the people you see on
      the surface. Wilmore&rsquo;s father was a parson, for instance. What did he do?
      He could not help himself: he supplied the army and navy with recruits!
      One son was in a marching regiment, the other was Jack, and three girls
      had vowed never to quit the rectory save as brides of officers. Nevil
      thought that seemed encouraging; we were evidently not a nation of
      shopkeepers at heart; and he quoted sayings of Mr. Stukely Culbrett&rsquo;s, in
      which neither his ear nor Wilmore&rsquo;s detected the under-ring Stukely was
      famous for: as that England had saddled herself with India for the express
      purpose of better obeying the Commandments in Europe; and that it would be
      a lamentable thing for the Continent and our doctrines if ever beef should
      fail the Briton, and such like. &lsquo;Depend upon it we&rsquo;re a fighting nation
      naturally, Jack,&rsquo; said Nevil. &lsquo;How can we submit!... however, I shall not
      be impatient. I dislike duelling, and hate war, but I will have the
      country respected.&rsquo; They planned a defence of the country, drawing their
      strategy from magazine articles by military pens, reverberations of the
      extinct voices of the daily and weekly journals, customary after a panic,
      and making bloody stands on spots of extreme pastoral beauty, which they
      visited by coach and rail, looking back on unfortified London with
      particular melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund&rsquo;s word may be trusted that she dropped the letter into a London
      post-office in pursuance of her promise to Nevil. The singular fact was
      that no answer to it ever arrived. Nevil, without a doubt of her honesty,
      proposed an expedition to Paris; he was ordered to join his ship, and he
      lay moored across the water in the port of Bevisham, panting for notice to
      be taken of him. The slight of the total disregard of his letter now
      affected him personally; it took him some time to get over this indignity
      put upon him, especially because of his being under the impression that
      the country suffered, not he at all. The letter had served its object:
      ever since the transmission of it the menaces and insults had ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they might be renewed, and he desired to stop them altogether. His
      last feeling was one of genuine regret that Frenchmen should have behaved
      unworthily of the high estimation he held them in. With which he dismissed
      the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was rallied about it when he next sat at his uncle&rsquo;s table, and had to
      pardon Rosamund for telling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevil replied modestly: &lsquo;I dare say you think me half a fool, sir. All I
      know is, I waited for my betters to speak first. I have no dislike of
      Frenchmen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Everard shook his head to signify, &lsquo;not half.&rsquo; But he was gentle enough in
      his observations. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a motto, Ex pede Herculem. You stepped out for
      the dogs to judge better of us. It&rsquo;s an infernally tripping motto for a
      composite structure like the kingdom of Great Britain and Manchester, boy
      Nevil. We can fight foreigners when the time comes.&rsquo; He directed Nevil to
      look home, and cast an eye on the cotton-spinners, with the remark that
      they were binding us hand and foot to sell us to the biggest buyer, and
      were not Englishmen but &lsquo;Germans and Jews, and quakers and hybrids,
      diligent clerks and speculators, and commercial travellers, who have
      raised a fortune from foisting drugged goods on an idiot population.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He loathed them for the curse they were to the country. And he was one of
      the few who spoke out. The fashion was to pet them. We stood against them;
      were halfhearted, and were beaten; and then we petted them, and bit by bit
      our privileges were torn away. We made lords of them to catch them, and
      they grocers of us by way of a return. &lsquo;Already,&rsquo; said Everard, &lsquo;they have
      knocked the nation&rsquo;s head off, and dry-rotted the bone of the people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t they,&rsquo; Nevil asked, &lsquo;belong to the Liberal party?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rsquo; Everard replied, &lsquo;they belong to any party that upsets
      the party above them. They belong to the GEORGE FOXE party, and my
      poultry-roosts are the mark they aim at. You shall have a glance at the
      manufacturing district some day. You shall see the machines they work
      with. You shall see the miserable lank-jawed half-stewed pantaloons
      they&rsquo;ve managed to make of Englishmen there. My blood &lsquo;s past boiling.
      They work young children in their factories from morning to night. Their
      manufactories are spreading like the webs of the devil to suck the blood
      of the country. In that district of theirs an epidemic levels men like a
      disease in sheep. Skeletons can&rsquo;t make a stand. On the top of it all they
      sing Sunday tunes!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This behaviour of corn-law agitators and protectors of poachers was an
      hypocrisy too horrible for comment. Everard sipped claret. Nevil lashed
      his head for the clear idea which objurgation insists upon implanting, but
      batters to pieces in the act.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Manchester&rsquo;s the belly of this country!&rsquo; Everard continued. &lsquo;So long as
      Manchester flourishes, we&rsquo;re a country governed and led by the belly. The
      head and the legs of the country are sound still; I don&rsquo;t guarantee it for
      long, but the middle&rsquo;s rapacious and corrupt. Take it on a question of
      foreign affairs, it &lsquo;s an alderman after a feast. Bring it upon home
      politics, you meet a wolf.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The faithful Whig veteran spoke with jolly admiration of the speech of a
      famous Tory chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was the way to talk to them! Denounce them traitors! Up whip, and
      set the ruffians capering! Hit them facers! Our men are always for the
      too-clever trick. They pluck the sprouts and eat them, as if the loss of a
      sprout or two thinned Manchester! Your policy of absorption is good enough
      when you&rsquo;re dealing with fragments. It&rsquo;s a devilish unlucky thing to
      attempt with a concrete mass. You might as well ask your head to absorb a
      wall by running at it like a pugnacious nigger. I don&rsquo;t want you to go
      into Parliament ever. You&rsquo;re a fitter man out of it; but if ever you&rsquo;re
      bitten&mdash;and it&rsquo;s the curse of our country to have politics as well as
      the other diseases&mdash;don&rsquo;t follow a flag, be independent, keep a free
      vote; remember how I&rsquo;ve been tied, and hold foot against Manchester. Do it
      blindfold; you don&rsquo;t want counselling, you&rsquo;re sure to be right. I&rsquo;ll lay
      you a blood-brood mare to a cabstand skeleton, you&rsquo;ll have an easy
      conscience and deserve the thanks of the country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevil listened gravely. The soundness of the head and legs of the country
      he took for granted. The inflated state of the unchivalrous middle,
      denominated Manchester, terrified him. Could it be true that England was
      betraying signs of decay? and signs how ignoble! Half-a-dozen crescent
      lines cunningly turned, sketched her figure before the world, and the
      reflection for one ready to die upholding her was that the portrait was no
      caricature. Such an emblematic presentation of the land of his filial
      affection haunted him with hideous mockeries. Surely the foreigner hearing
      our boasts of her must compare us to showmen bawling the attractions of a
      Fat Lady at a fair!
    </p>
    <p>
      Swoln Manchester bore the blame of it. Everard exulted to hear his young
      echo attack the cotton-spinners. But Nevil was for a plan, a system,
      immediate action; the descending among the people, and taking an
      initiative, LEADING them, insisting on their following, not standing aloof
      and shrugging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We lead them in war,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;why not in peace? There&rsquo;s a front for
      peace as well as war, and that&rsquo;s our place rightly. We&rsquo;re pushed aside;
      why, it seems to me we&rsquo;re treated like old-fashioned ornaments! The fault
      must be ours. Shrugging and sneering is about as honourable as blazing
      fireworks over your own defeat. Back we have to go! that&rsquo;s the point, sir.
      And as for jeering the cotton-spinners, I can&rsquo;t while they&rsquo;ve the lead of
      us. We let them have it! And we have thrice the stake in the country. I
      don&rsquo;t mean properties and titles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Deuce you don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said his uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean our names, our histories; I mean our duties. As for titles, the
      way to defend them is to be worthy of them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Damned fine speech,&rsquo; remarked Everard. &lsquo;Now you get out of that trick of
      prize-orationing. I call it snuffery, sir; it&rsquo;s all to your own nose!
      You&rsquo;re talking to me, not to a gallery. &ldquo;Worthy of them!&rdquo; Caesar wraps his
      head in his robe: he gets his dig in the ribs for all his attitudinizing.
      It&rsquo;s very well for a man to talk like that who owns no more than his
      barebodkin life, poor devil. Tall talk&rsquo;s his jewelry: he must have his
      dandification in bunkum. You ought to know better. Property and titles are
      worth having, whether you are &ldquo;worthy of them&rdquo; or a disgrace to your
      class. The best way of defending them is to keep a strong fist, and take
      care you don&rsquo;t draw your fore-foot back more than enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please propose something to be done,&rsquo; said Nevil, depressed by the
      recommendation of that attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everard proposed a fight for every privilege his class possessed. &lsquo;They
      say,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;a nobleman fighting the odds is a sight for the gods: and
      I wouldn&rsquo;t yield an inch of ground. It&rsquo;s no use calling things by fine
      names&mdash;the country&rsquo;s ruined by cowardice. Poursuivez! I cry. Haro! at
      them! The biggest hart wins in the end. I haven&rsquo;t a doubt about that. And
      I haven&rsquo;t a doubt we carry the tonnage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the people,&rsquo; sighed Nevil, entangled in his uncle&rsquo;s haziness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What people?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose the people of Great Britain count, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course they do; when the battle&rsquo;s done, the fight lost and won.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you expect the people to look on, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The people always wait for the winner, boy Nevil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young fellow exclaimed despondingly, &lsquo;If it were a race!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s like a race, and we&rsquo;re confoundedly out of training,&rsquo; said Everard.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he rested. A mediaeval gentleman with the docile notions of the
      twelfth century, complacently driving them to grass and wattling them in
      the nineteenth, could be of no use to a boy trying to think, though he
      could set the youngster galloping. Nevil wandered about the woods of
      Steynham, disinclined to shoot and lend a hand to country sports. The
      popping of the guns of his uncle and guests hung about his ears much like
      their speech, which was unobjectionable in itself, but not sufficient; a
      little hard, he thought, a little idle. He wanted something, and wanted
      them to give their time and energy to something, that was not to be had in
      a market. The nobles, he felt sure, might resume their natural alliance
      with the people, and lead them, as they did of old, to the battle-field.
      How might they? A comely Sussex lass could not well tell him how.
      Sarcastic reports of the troublesome questioner represented him applying
      to a nymph of the country for enlightenment. He thrilled surprisingly
      under the charm of feminine beauty. &lsquo;The fellow&rsquo;s sound at bottom,&rsquo; his
      uncle said, hearing of his having really been seen walking in the complete
      form proper to his budding age, that is, in two halves. Nevil showed that
      he had gained an acquaintance with the struggles of the neighbouring
      agricultural poor to live and rear their children. His uncle&rsquo;s table
      roared at his enumeration of the sickly little beings, consumptive or
      bandy-legged, within a radius of five miles of Steynham. Action was what
      he wanted, Everard said. Nevil perhaps thought the same, for he dashed out
      of his mooning with a wave of the Tory standard, delighting the ladies,
      though in that conflict of the Lion and the Unicorn (which was a Tory
      song) he seemed rather to wish to goad the dear lion than crush the
      one-horned intrusive upstart. His calling on the crack corps of Peers to
      enrol themselves forthwith in the front ranks, and to anticipate
      opposition by initiating measures, and so cut out that funny old crazy old
      galleon, the People, from under the batteries of the enemy, highly amused
      the gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before rejoining his ship, Nevil paid his customary short visit of
      ceremony to his great-aunt Beauchamp&mdash;a venerable lady past eighty,
      hitherto divided from him in sympathy by her dislike of his uncle Everard,
      who had once been his living hero. That was when he was in frocks, and
      still the tenacious fellow could not bear to hear his uncle spoken ill of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All the men of that family are heartless, and he is a man of wood, my
      dear, and a bad man,&rsquo; the old lady said. &lsquo;He should have kept you at
      school, and sent you to college. You want reading and teaching and talking
      to. Such a house as that is should never be a home for you.&rsquo; She hinted at
      Rosamund. Nevil defended the persecuted woman, but with no better success
      than from the attacks of the Romfrey ladies; with this difference,
      however, that these decried the woman&rsquo;s vicious arts, and Mistress
      Elizabeth Mary Beauchamp put all the sin upon the man. Such a man! she
      said. &lsquo;Let me hear that he has married her, I will not utter another
      word.&rsquo; Nevil echoed, &lsquo;Married!&rsquo; in a different key.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am as much of an aristocrat as any of you, only I rank morality
      higher,&rsquo; said Mrs. Beauchamp. &lsquo;When you were a child I offered to take you
      and make you my heir, and I would have educated you. You shall see a
      great-nephew of mine that I did educate; he is eating his dinners for the
      bar in London, and comes to me every Sunday. I shall marry him to a good
      girl, and I shall show your uncle what my kind of man-making is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevil had no desire to meet the other great-nephew, especially when he was
      aware of the extraordinary circumstance that a Beauchamp great-niece,
      having no money, had bestowed her hand on a Manchester man defunct,
      whereof this young Blackburn Tuckham, the lawyer, was issue. He took his
      leave of Mrs. Elizabeth Beauchamp, respecting her for her constitutional
      health and brightness, and regretting for the sake of the country that she
      had not married to give England men and women resembling her. On the whole
      he considered her wiser in her prescription for the malady besetting him
      than his uncle. He knew that action was but a temporary remedy. College
      would have been his chronic medicine, and the old lady&rsquo;s acuteness in
      seeing it impressed him forcibly. She had given him a peaceable two days
      on the Upper Thames, in an atmosphere of plain good sense and
      just-mindedness. He wrote to thank her, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My England at sea will be your parlour-window looking down the grass to
      the river and rushes; and when you do me the honour to write, please tell
      me the names of those wildflowers growing along the banks in Summer.&rsquo; The
      old lady replied immediately, enclosing a cheque for fifty pounds:
      &lsquo;Colonel Halkett informs me you are under a cloud at Steynham, and I have
      thought you may be in want of pocket-money. The wild-flowers are
      willowherb, meadow-sweet, and loosestrife. I shall be glad when you are
      here in Summer to see them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevil despatched the following: &lsquo;I thank you, but I shall not cash the
      cheque. The Steynham tale is this:
    </p>
    <p>
      I happened to be out at night, and stopped the keepers in chase of a young
      fellow trespassing. I caught him myself, but recognized him as one of a
      family I take an interest in, and let him run before they came up. My
      uncle heard a gun; I sent the head gamekeeper word in the morning to out
      with it all. Uncle E. was annoyed, and we had a rough parting. If you are
      rewarding me for this, I have no right to it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beauchamp rejoined: &lsquo;Your profession should teach you subordination,
      if it does nothing else that is valuable to a Christian gentleman. You
      will receive from the publisher the &ldquo;Life and Letters of Lord
      Collingwood,&rdquo; whom I have it in my mind that a young midshipman should
      task himself to imitate. Spend the money as you think fit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevil&rsquo;s ship, commanded by Captain Robert Hall (a most gallant officer,
      one of his heroes, and of Lancashire origin, strangely!), flew to the
      South American station, in and about Lord Cochrane&rsquo;s waters; then as
      swiftly back. For, like the frail Norwegian bark on the edge of the
      maelstrom, liker to a country of conflicting interests and passions, that
      is not mentally on a level with its good fortune, England was drifting
      into foreign complications. A paralyzed Minister proclaimed it. The
      governing people, which is looked to for direction in grave dilemmas by
      its representatives and reflectors, shouted that it had been accused of
      pusillanimity. No one had any desire for war, only we really had (and it
      was perfectly true) been talking gigantic nonsense of peace, and of the
      everlastingness of the exchange of fruits for money, with angels waving
      raw-groceries of Eden in joy of the commercial picture. Therefore, to
      correct the excesses of that fit, we held the standing by the Moslem, on
      behalf of the Mediterranean (and the Moslem is one of our customers,
      bearing an excellent reputation for the payment of debts), to be good,
      granting the necessity. We deplored the necessity. The Press wept over it.
      That, however, was not the politic tone for us while the Imperial berg of
      Polar ice watched us keenly; and the Press proceeded to remind us that we
      had once been bull-dogs. Was there not an animal within us having a right
      to a turn now and then? And was it not (Falstaff, on a calm world, was
      quoted) for the benefit of our constitutions now and then to loosen the
      animal? Granting the necessity, of course. By dint of incessantly speaking
      of the necessity we granted it unknowingly. The lighter hearts regarded
      our period of monotonously lyrical prosperity as a man sensible of fresh
      morning air looks back on the snoring bolster. Many of the graver were
      glad of a change. After all that maundering over the blessed peace which
      brings the raisin and the currant for the pudding, and shuts up the cannon
      with a sheep&rsquo;s head, it became a principle of popular taste to descant on
      the vivifying virtues of war; even as, after ten months of money-mongering
      in smoky London, the citizen hails the sea-breeze and an immersion in
      unruly brine, despite the cost, that breeze and brine may make a man of
      him, according to the doctor&rsquo;s prescription: sweet is home, but health is
      sweeter! Then was there another curious exhibition of us. Gentlemen, to
      the exact number of the Graces, dressed in drab of an ancient cut, made a
      pilgrimage to the icy despot, and besought him to give way for Piety&rsquo;s
      sake. He, courteous, colossal, and immoveable, waved them homeward. They
      returned and were hooted for belying the bellicose by their mission, and
      interpreting too well the peaceful. They were the unparalyzed Ministers of
      the occasion, but helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now came war, the purifier and the pestilence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cry of the English people for war was pretty general, as far as the
      criers went. They put on their Sabbath face concerning the declaration of
      war, and told with approval how the Royal hand had trembled in committing
      itself to the form of signature to which its action is limited. If there
      was money to be paid, there was a bugbear to be slain for it; and a
      bugbear is as obnoxious to the repose of commercial communities as rivals
      are to kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cry for war was absolutely unanimous, and a supremely national cry,
      Everard Romfrey said, for it excluded the cotton-spinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smacked his hands, crowing at the vociferations of disgust of those
      negrophiles and sweaters of Christians, whose isolated clamour amid the
      popular uproar sounded of gagged mouths.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the half-stifled cotton-spinners, a notorious one, a spouter of
      rank sedition and hater of aristocracy, a political poacher, managed to
      make himself heard. He was tossed to the Press for morsel, and tossed back
      to the people in strips. Everard had a sharp return of appetite in reading
      the daily and weekly journals. They printed logic, they printed sense;
      they abused the treasonable barking cur unmercifully. They printed almost
      as much as he would have uttered, excepting the strong salt of his
      similes, likening that rascal and his crew to the American weed in our
      waters, to the rotting wild bees&rsquo; nest in our trees, to the worm in our
      ships&rsquo; timbers, and to lamentable afflictions of the human frame, and of
      sheep, oxen, honest hounds. Manchester was in eclipse. The world of
      England discovered that the peace-party which opposed was the actual cause
      of the war: never was indication clearer. But my business is with Mr.
      Beauchamp, to know whom, and partly understand his conduct in after-days,
      it will be as well to take a bird&rsquo;seye glance at him through the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Everard, &lsquo;we shall see what staff there is in that fellow
      Nevil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He expected, as you may imagine, a true young Beauchamp-Romfrey to be
      straining his collar like a leash-hound.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. A GLIMPSE OF NEVIL IN ACTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The young gentleman to whom Everard Romfrey transferred his combative
      spirit despatched a letter from the Dardanelles, requesting his uncle not
      to ask him for a spark of enthusiasm. He despised our Moslem allies, he
      said, and thought with pity of the miserable herds of men in regiments
      marching across the steppes at the bidding of a despot that we were
      helping to popularize. He certainly wrote in the tone of a jejune
      politician; pardonable stuff to seniors entertaining similar opinions, but
      most exasperating when it runs counter to them: though one question put by
      Nevil was not easily answerable. He wished to know whether the English
      people would be so anxious to be at it if their man stood on the opposite
      shore and talked of trying conclusions on their green fields. And he
      suggested that they had become so ready for war because of their having
      grown rather ashamed of themselves, and for the special reason that they
      could have it at a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The rascal&rsquo;s liver&rsquo;s out of order,&rsquo; Everard said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming to the sentence: &lsquo;Who speaks out in this crisis? There is one, and
      I am with him&rsquo;; Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s compassionate sentiments veered round to
      irate amazement. For the person alluded to was indeed the infamous
      miauling cotton-spinner. Nevil admired him. He said so bluntly. He pointed
      to that traitorous George-Foxite as the one heroical Englishman of his
      day, declaring that he felt bound in honour to make known his admiration
      for the man; and he hoped his uncle would excuse him. &lsquo;If we differ, I am
      sorry, sir; but I should be a coward to withhold what I think of him when
      he has all England against him, and he is in the right, as England will
      discover. I maintain he speaks wisely&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mind saying, like a
      prophet; and he speaks on behalf of the poor as well as of the country. He
      appears to me the only public man who looks to the state of the poor&mdash;I
      mean, their interests. They pay for war, and if we are to have peace at
      home and strength for a really national war, the only war we can ever call
      necessary, the poor must be contented. He sees that. I shall not run the
      risk of angering you by writing to defend him, unless I hear of his being
      shamefully mishandled, and the bearer of an old name can be of service to
      him. I cannot say less, and will say no more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Everard apostrophized his absent nephew: &lsquo;You jackass!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I am reminded by Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s profound disappointment in the youth, that
      it will be repeatedly shared by many others: and I am bound to forewarn
      readers of this history that there is no plot in it. The hero is
      chargeable with the official disqualification of constantly offending
      prejudices, never seeking to please; and all the while it is upon him the
      narrative hangs. To be a public favourite is his last thought.
      Beauchampism, as one confronting him calls it, may be said to stand for
      nearly everything which is the obverse of Byronism, and rarely woos your
      sympathy, shuns the statuesque pathetic, or any kind of posturing. For
      Beauchamp will not even look at happiness to mourn its absence; melodious
      lamentations, demoniacal scorn, are quite alien to him. His faith is in
      working and fighting. With every inducement to offer himself for a
      romantic figure, he despises the pomades and curling-irons of modern
      romance, its shears and its labels: in fine, every one of those positive
      things by whose aid, and by some adroit flourishing of them, the nimbus
      known as a mysterious halo is produced about a gentleman&rsquo;s head. And a
      highly alluring adornment it is! We are all given to lose our solidity and
      fly at it; although the faithful mirror of fiction has been showing us
      latterly that a too superhuman beauty has disturbed popular belief in the
      bare beginnings of the existence of heroes: but this, very likely, is
      nothing more than a fit of Republicanism in the nursery, and a deposition
      of the leading doll for lack of variety in him. That conqueror of
      circumstances will, the dullest soul may begin predicting, return on his
      cockhorse to favour and authority. Meantime the exhibition of a hero whom
      circumstances overcome, and who does not weep or ask you for a tear, who
      continually forfeits attractiveness by declining to better his own
      fortunes, must run the chances of a novelty during the interregnum.
      Nursery Legitimists will be against him to a man; Republicans likewise,
      after a queer sniff at his pretensions, it is to be feared. For me, I have
      so little command over him, that in spite of my nursery tastes, he drags
      me whither he lists. It is artless art and monstrous innovation to present
      so wilful a figure, but were I to create a striking fable for him, and set
      him off with scenic effects and contrasts, it would be only a momentary
      tonic to you, to him instant death. He could not live in such an
      atmosphere. The simple truth has to be told: how he loved his country, and
      for another and a broader love, growing out of his first passion, fought
      it; and being small by comparison, and finding no giant of the Philistines
      disposed to receive a stone in his fore-skull, pummelled the obmutescent
      mass, to the confusion of a conceivable epic. His indifferent England
      refused it to him. That is all I can say. The greater power of the two,
      she seems, with a quiet derision that does not belie her amiable
      passivity, to have reduced in Beauchamp&rsquo;s career the boldest readiness for
      public action, and some good stout efforts besides, to the flat result of
      an optically discernible influence of our hero&rsquo;s character in the domestic
      circle; perhaps a faintly-outlined circle or two beyond it. But this does
      not forbid him to be ranked as one of the most distinguishing of her
      children of the day he lived in. Blame the victrix if you think he should
      have been livelier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevil soon had to turn his telescope from politics. The torch of war was
      actually lighting, and he was not fashioned to be heedless of what
      surrounded him. Our diplomacy, after dancing with all the suppleness of
      stilts, gravely resigned the gift of motion. Our dauntless Lancastrian
      thundered like a tempest over a gambling tent, disregarded. Our worthy
      people, consenting to the doctrine that war is a scourge, contracted the
      habit of thinking it, in this case, the dire necessity which is the sole
      excuse for giving way to an irritated pugnacity, and sucked the comforting
      caramel of an alliance with their troublesome next-door neighbour, profuse
      in comfits as in scorpions. Nevil detected that politic element of their
      promptitude for war. His recollections of dissatisfaction in former days
      assisted him to perceive the nature of it, but he was too young to hold
      his own against the hubbub of a noisy people, much too young to remain
      sceptical of a modern people&rsquo;s enthusiasm for war while journals were
      testifying to it down the length of their columns, and letters from home
      palpitated with it, and shipmates yawned wearily for the signal, and
      shiploads of red coats and blue, infantry, cavalry, artillery, were
      singing farewell to the girl at home, and hurrah for anything in foreign
      waters. He joined the stream with a cordial spirit. Since it must be so!
      The wind of that haughty proceeding of the Great Bear in putting a paw
      over the neutral brook brushed his cheek unpleasantly. He clapped hands
      for the fezzy defenders of the border fortress, and when the order came
      for the fleet to enter the old romantic sea of storms and fables, he wrote
      home a letter fit for his uncle Everard to read. Then there was the
      sailing and the landing, and the march up the heights, which Nevil was
      condemned to look at. To his joy he obtained an appointment on shore, and
      after that Everard heard of him from other channels. The two were of a
      mind when the savage winter advanced which froze the attack of the city,
      and might be imaged as the hoar god of hostile elements pointing a hand to
      the line reached, and menacing at one farther step. Both blamed the
      Government, but they divided as to the origin of governmental
      inefficiency; Nevil accusing the Lords guilty of foulest sloth, Everard
      the Quakers of dry-rotting the country. He passed with a shrug Nevil&rsquo;s
      puling outcry for the enemy as well as our own poor fellows: &lsquo;At his
      steppes again!&rsquo; And he had to be forgiving when reports came of his
      nephew&rsquo;s turn for overdoing his duty: &lsquo;show-fighting,&rsquo; as he termed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Braggadocioing in deeds is only next bad to mouthing it,&rsquo; he wrote very
      rationally. &lsquo;Stick to your line. Don&rsquo;t go out of it till you are ordered
      out. Remember that we want soldiers and sailors, we don&rsquo;t want suicides.&rsquo; 
      He condescended to these italics, considering impressiveness to be urgent.
      In his heart, notwithstanding his implacably clear judgement, he was
      passably well pleased with the congratulations encompassing him on account
      of his nephew&rsquo;s gallantry at a period of dejection in Britain: for the
      winter was dreadful; every kind heart that went to bed with cold feet felt
      acutely for our soldiers on the frozen heights, and thoughts of heroes
      were as good as warming-pans. Heroes we would have. It happens in war as
      in wit, that all the birds of wonder fly to a flaring reputation. He that
      has done one wild thing must necessarily have done the other; so Nevil
      found himself standing in the thick of a fame that blew rank eulogies on
      him for acts he had not performed. The Earl of Romfrey forwarded hampers
      and a letter of praise. &lsquo;They tell me that while you were facing the
      enemy, temporarily attaching yourself to one of the regiments&mdash;I
      forget which, though I have heard it named&mdash;you sprang out under fire
      on an eagle clawing a hare. I like that. I hope you had the benefit of the
      hare. She is our property, and I have issued an injunction that she shall
      not go into the newspapers.&rsquo; Everard was entirely of a contrary opinion
      concerning the episode of eagle and hare, though it was a case of a bird
      of prey interfering with an object of the chase. Nevil wrote home most
      entreatingly and imperatively, like one wincing, begging him to contradict
      that and certain other stories, and prescribing the form of a public
      renunciation of his proclaimed part in them. &lsquo;The hare,&rsquo; he sent word, &lsquo;is
      the property of young Michell of the Rodney, and he is the humanest and
      the gallantest fellow in the service. I have written to my Lord. Pray help
      to rid me of burdens that make me feel like a robber and impostor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Everard replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have a letter from your captain, informing me that I am unlikely to see
      you home unless you learn to hold yourself in. I wish you were in another
      battery than Robert Hall&rsquo;s. He forgets the force of example, however much
      of a dab he may be at precept. But there you are, and please clap a
      hundredweight on your appetite for figuring, will you. Do you think there
      is any good in helping to Frenchify our army? I loathe a fellow who shoots
      at a medal. I wager he is easy enough to be caught by circumvention&mdash;put
      me in the open with him. Tom Biggot, the boxer, went over to Paris, and
      stood in the ring with one of their dancing pugilists, and the first round
      he got a crack on the chin from the rogue&rsquo;s foot; the second round he
      caught him by the lifted leg, and punished him till pec was all he could
      say of peccavi. Fight the straightforward fight. Hang flan! Battle is a
      game of give and take, and if our men get elanned, we shall see them
      refusing to come up to time. This new crossing and medalling is the
      devil&rsquo;s own notion for upsetting a solid British line, and tempting
      fellows to get invalided that they may blaze it before the shopkeepers and
      their wives in the city. Give us an army!&mdash;none of your caperers.
      Here are lots of circusy heroes coming home to rest after their fatigues.
      One was spouting at a public dinner yesterday night. He went into it
      upright, and he ran out of it upright&mdash;at the head of his men!&mdash;and
      here he is feasted by the citizens and making a speech upright, and my boy
      fronting the enemy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Everard&rsquo;s involuntary break-down from his veteran&rsquo;s roughness to a touch
      of feeling thrilled Nevil, who began to perceive what his uncle was
      driving at when he rebuked the coxcombry of the field, and spoke of the
      description of compliment your hero was paying Englishmen in affecting to
      give them examples of bravery and preternatural coolness. Nevil sent home
      humble confessions of guilt in this respect, with fresh praises of young
      Michell: for though Everard, as Nevil recognized it, was perfectly right
      in the abstract, and generally right, there are times when an example is
      needed by brave men&mdash;times when the fiery furnace of death&rsquo;s
      dragon-jaw is not inviting even to Englishmen receiving the word that duty
      bids them advance, and they require a leader of the way. A national
      coxcombry that pretends to an independence of human sensations, and makes
      a motto of our dandiacal courage, is more perilous to the armies of the
      nation than that of a few heroes. It is this coxcombry which has too often
      caused disdain of the wise chief&rsquo;s maxim of calculation for winners,
      namely, to have always the odds on your side, and which has bled,
      shattered, and occasionally disgraced us. Young Michell&rsquo;s carrying
      powder-bags to the assault, and when ordered to retire, bearing them on
      his back, and helping a wounded soldier on the way, did surely well; nor
      did Mr. Beauchamp himself behave so badly on an occasion when the sailors
      of his battery caught him out of a fire of shell that raised jets of dust
      and smoke like a range of geysers over the open, and hugged him as loving
      women do at a meeting or a parting. He was penitent before his uncle,
      admitting, first, that the men were not in want of an example of the
      contempt of death, and secondly, that he doubted whether it was contempt
      of death on his part so much as pride&mdash;a hatred of being seen
      running.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like the fellow to be drawing it so fine,&rsquo; said Everard. It
      sounded to him a trifle parsonical. But his heart was won by Nevil&rsquo;s
      determination to wear out the campaign rather than be invalided or
      entrusted with a holiday duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see with shame (admiration of them) old infantry captains and colonels
      of no position beyond their rank in the army, sticking to their post,&rsquo; 
      said Nevil, &lsquo;and a lord and a lord and a lord slipping off as though the
      stuff of the man in him had melted. I shall go through with it.&rsquo; Everard
      approved him. Colonel Halkett wrote that the youth was a skeleton. Still
      Everard encouraged him to persevere, and said of him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I like him for holding to his work after the strain&rsquo;s over. That tells
      the man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He observed at his table, in reply to commendations of his nephew:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil&rsquo;s leak is his political craze, and that seems to be going: I hope
      it is. You can&rsquo;t rear a man on politics. When I was of his age I never
      looked at the newspapers, except to read the divorce cases. I came to
      politics with a ripe judgement. He shines in action, and he&rsquo;ll find that
      out, and leave others the palavering.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was upon the close of the war that Nevil drove his uncle to avow a
      downright undisguised indignation with him. He caught a fever in the
      French camp, where he was dispensing vivers and provends out of English
      hampers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those French fellows are every man of them trained up to snapping-point,&rsquo; 
      said Everard. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re sure to have them if you hold out long against them.
      And greedy dogs too: they&rsquo;re for half our hampers, and all the glory. And
      there&rsquo;s Nevil down on his back in the thick of them! Will anybody tell me
      why the devil he must be poking into the French camp? They were ready
      enough to run to him and beg potatoes. It &lsquo;s all for humanity he does
      it-mark that. Never was a word fitter for a quack&rsquo;s mouth than &ldquo;humanity.&rdquo;
       Two syllables more, and the parsons would be riding it to sawdust.
      Humanity! Humanitomtity! It&rsquo;s the best word of the two for half the things
      done in the name of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A tremendously bracing epistle, excellent for an access of fever, was
      despatched to humanity&rsquo;s curate, and Everard sat expecting a hot
      rejoinder, or else a black sealed letter, but neither one nor the other
      arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, to his disgust, came rumours of peace between the mighty
      belligerents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silver trumpets of peace were nowhere hearkened to with satisfaction
      by the bull-dogs, though triumph rang sonorously through the music, for
      they had been severely mangled, as usual at the outset, and they had at
      last got their grip, and were in high condition for fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most expansive panegyrists of our deeds did not dare affirm of the
      most famous of them, that England had embarked her costly cavalry to offer
      it for a mark of artillery-balls on three sides of a square: and the
      belief was universal that we could do more business-like deeds and play
      the great game of blunders with an ability refined by experience. Everard
      Romfrey was one of those who thought themselves justified in insisting
      upon the continuation of the war, in contempt of our allies. His favourite
      saying that constitution beats the world, was being splendidly manifested
      by our bearing. He was very uneasy; he would not hear of peace; and not
      only that, the imperial gentleman soberly committed the naivete of sending
      word to Nevil to let him know immediately the opinion of the camp
      concerning it, as perchance an old Roman knight may have written to some
      young aquilifer of the Praetorians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allies, however, are of the description of twins joined by a membrane, and
      supposing that one of them determines to sit down, the other will act
      wisely in bending his knees at once, and doing the same: he cannot but be
      extremely uncomfortable left standing. Besides, there was the Ottoman
      cleverly poised again; the Muscovite was battered; fresh guilt was added
      to the military glory of the Gaul. English grumblers might well be asked
      what they had fought for, if they were not contented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett mentioned a report that Nevil had received a slight
      thigh-wound of small importance. At any rate, something was the matter
      with him, and it was naturally imagined that he would have double cause to
      write home; and still more so for the reason, his uncle confessed, that he
      had foreseen the folly of a war conducted by milky cotton-spinners and
      their adjuncts, in partnership with a throned gambler, who had won his
      stake, and now snapped his fingers at them. Everard expected, he had
      prepared himself for, the young naval politician&rsquo;s crow, and he meant to
      admit frankly that he had been wrong in wishing to fight anybody without
      having first crushed the cotton faction. But Nevil continued silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dead in hospital or a Turk hotel!&rsquo; sighed Everard; &lsquo;and no more to the
      scoundrels over there than a body to be shovelled into slack lime.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund Culling was the only witness of his remarkable betrayal of grief.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. RENEE
    </h2>
    <p>
      At last, one morning, arrived a letter from a French gentleman signing
      himself Comte Cresnes de Croisnel, in which Everard was informed that his
      nephew had accompanied the son of the writer, Captain de Croisnel, on
      board an Austrian boat out of the East, and was lying in Venice under a
      return-attack of fever,&mdash;not, the count stated pointedly, in the
      hands of an Italian physician. He had brought his own with him to meet his
      son, who was likewise disabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everard was assured by M. de Croisnel that every attention and
      affectionate care were being rendered to his gallant and adored nephew&mdash;&lsquo;vrai
      type de tout ce qu&rsquo;il y a de noble et de chevaleresque dans la vieille
      Angleterre&rsquo;&mdash;from a family bound to him by the tenderest obligations,
      personal and national; one as dear to every member of it as the brother,
      the son, they welcomed with thankful hearts to the Divine interposition
      restoring him to them. In conclusion, the count proposed something like
      the embrace of a fraternal friendship should Everard think fit to act upon
      the spontaneous sentiments of a loving relative, and join them in Venice
      to watch over his nephew&rsquo;s recovery. Already M. Nevil was stronger. The
      gondola was a medicine in itself, the count said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everard knitted his mouth to intensify a peculiar subdued form of laughter
      through the nose, in hopeless ridicule of a Frenchman&rsquo;s notions of an
      Englishman&rsquo;s occupations&mdash;presumed across Channel to allow of his
      breaking loose from shooting engagements at a minute&rsquo;s notice, to rush off
      to a fetid foreign city notorious for mud and mosquitoes, and commence
      capering and grimacing, pouring forth a jugful of ready-made
      extravagances, with &lsquo;mon fils! mon cher neveu! Dieu!&rsquo; and similar
      fiddlededee. These were matters for women to do, if they chose: women and
      Frenchmen were much of a pattern. Moreover, he knew the hotel this Comte
      de Croisnel was staying at. He gasped at the name of it: he had rather
      encounter a grisly bear than a mosquito any night of his life, for no
      stretch of cunning outwits a mosquito; and enlarging on the qualities of
      the terrific insect, he vowed it was damnation without trial or judgement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, Mrs. Culling&rsquo;s departure was permitted. He argued, &lsquo;Why go?
      the fellow&rsquo;s comfortable, getting himself together, and you say the French
      are good nurses.&rsquo; But her entreaties to go were vehement, though Venice
      had no happy place in her recollections, and he withheld his objections to
      her going. For him, the fields forbade it. He sent hearty messages to
      Nevil, and that was enough, considering that the young dog of &lsquo;humanity&rsquo; 
      had clearly been running out of his way to catch a jaundice, and was
      bereaving his houses of the matronly government, deprived of which they
      were all of them likely soon to be at sixes and sevens with disorderly
      lacqueys, peccant maids, and cooks in hysterics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now if the master of his fortunes had come to Venice!&mdash;Nevil started
      the supposition in his mind often after hope had sunk.&mdash;Everard would
      have seen a young sailor and a soldier the thinner for wear, reclining in
      a gondola half the day, fanned by a brunette of the fine lineaments of the
      good blood of France. She chattered snatches of Venetian caught from the
      gondoliers, she was like a delicate cup of crystal brimming with the
      beauty of the place, and making one of them drink in all his impressions
      through her. Her features had the soft irregularities which run to
      rarities of beauty, as the ripple rocks the light; mouth, eyes, brows,
      nostrils, and bloomy cheeks played into one another liquidly; thought
      flew, tongue followed, and the flash of meaning quivered over them like
      night-lightning. Or oftener, to speak truth, tongue flew, thought
      followed: her age was but newly seventeen, and she was French.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her name was Renee. She was the only daughter of the Comte de Croisnel.
      Her brother Roland owed his life to Nevil, this Englishman proud of a
      French name&mdash;Nevil Beauchamp. If there was any warm feeling below the
      unruffled surface of the girl&rsquo;s deliberate eyes while gazing on him, it
      was that he who had saved her brother must be nearly brother himself, yet
      was not quite, yet must be loved, yet not approached. He was her brother&rsquo;s
      brother-in-arms, brother-in-heart, not hers, yet hers through her brother.
      His French name rescued him from foreignness. He spoke her language with a
      piquant accent, unlike the pitiable English. Unlike them, he was gracious,
      and could be soft and quick. The battle-scarlet, battle-black, Roland&rsquo;s
      tales of him threw round him in her imagination, made his gentleness a
      surprise. If, then, he was hers through her brother, what was she to him?
      The question did not spring clearly within her, though she was alive to
      every gradual change of manner toward the convalescent necessitated by the
      laws overawing her sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Venice was the French girl&rsquo;s dream. She was realizing it hungrily,
      revelling in it, anatomizing it, picking it to pieces, reviewing it,
      comparing her work with the original, and the original with her first
      conception, until beautiful sad Venice threatened to be no more her dream,
      and in dread of disenchantment she tried to take impressions humbly,
      really tasked herself not to analyze, not to dictate from a French
      footing, not to scorn. Not to be petulant with objects disappointing her,
      was an impossible task. She could not consent to a compromise with the
      people, the merchandize, the odours of the city. Gliding in the gondola
      through the narrow canals at low tide, she leaned back simulating stupor,
      with one word&mdash;&lsquo;Venezia!&rsquo; Her brother was commanded to smoke: &lsquo;Fumez,
      fumez, Roland!&rsquo; As soon as the steel-crested prow had pushed into her
      Paradise of the Canal Grande, she quietly shrouded her hair from tobacco,
      and called upon rapture to recompense her for her sufferings. The black
      gondola was unendurable to her. She had accompanied her father to the
      Accademia, and mused on the golden Venetian streets of Carpaccio: she must
      have an open gondola to decorate in his manner, gaily, splendidly, and
      mock at her efforts&mdash;a warning to all that might hope to improve the
      prevailing gloom and squalor by levying contributions upon the Merceria!
      Her most constant admiration was for the English lord who used once to
      ride on the Lido sands and visit the Armenian convent&mdash;a lord and a
      poet. [Lord Byron D.W.]
    </p>
    <p>
      This was to be infinitely more than a naval lieutenant. But Nevil claimed
      her as little personally as he allowed her to be claimed by another. The
      graces of her freaks of petulance and airy whims, her sprightly jets of
      wilfulness, fleeting frowns of contempt, imperious decisions, were all
      beautiful, like silver-shifting waves, in this lustrous planet of her pure
      freedom; and if you will seize the divine conception of Artemis, and own
      the goddess French, you will understand his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though he admired fervently, and danced obediently to her tunes, Nevil
      could not hear injustice done to a people or historic poetic city without
      trying hard to right the mind guilty of it. A newspaper correspondent, a
      Mr. John Holles, lingering on his road home from the army, put him on the
      track of an Englishman&rsquo;s books&mdash;touching the spirit as well as the
      stones of Venice, and Nevil thanked him when he had turned some of the
      leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The study of the books to school Renee was pursued, like the Bianchina&rsquo;s
      sleep, in gondoletta, and was not unlike it at intervals. A translated
      sentence was the key to a reverie. Renee leaned back, meditating; he
      forward, the book on his knee: Roland left them to themselves, and spied
      for the Bianchina behind the window-bars. The count was in the churches or
      the Galleries. Renee thought she began to comprehend the spirit of Venice,
      and chided her rebelliousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But our Venice was the Venice of the decadence, then!&rsquo; she said,
      complaining. Nevil read on, distrustful of the perspicuity of his own
      ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, but,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;when these Venetians were rough men, chanting like
      our Huguenots, how cold it must have been here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She hoped she was not very wrong in preferring the times of the great
      Venetian painters and martial doges to that period of faith and
      stone-cutting. What was done then might be beautiful, but the life was
      monotonous; she insisted that it was Huguenot; harsh, nasal, sombre,
      insolent, self-sufficient. Her eyes lightened for the flashing colours and
      pageantries, and the threads of desperate adventure crossing the Rii to
      this and that palace-door and balcony, like faint blood-streaks; the times
      of Venice in full flower. She reasoned against the hard eloquent
      Englishman of the books. &lsquo;But we are known by our fruits, are we not? and
      the Venice I admire was surely the fruit of these stonecutters chanting
      hymns of faith; it could not but be: and if it deserved, as he says, to
      die disgraced, I think we should go back to them and ask them whether
      their minds were as pure and holy as he supposes.&rsquo; Her French wits would
      not be subdued. Nevil pointed to the palaces. &lsquo;Pride,&rsquo; said she. He argued
      that the original Venetians were not responsible for their offspring. &lsquo;You
      say it?&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;you, of an old race? Oh, no; you do not feel it!&rsquo; and
      the trembling fervour of her voice convinced him that he did not, could
      not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee said: &lsquo;I know my ancestors are bound up in me, by my sentiments to
      them; and so do you, M. Nevil. We shame them if we fail in courage and
      honour. Is it not so? If we break a single pledged word we cast shame on
      them. Why, that makes us what we are; that is our distinction: we dare not
      be weak if we would. And therefore when Venice is reproached with avarice
      and luxury, I choose to say&mdash;what do we hear of the children of
      misers? and I say I am certain that those old cold Huguenot stonecutters
      were proud and grasping. I am sure they were, and they shall share the
      blame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevil plunged into his volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called on Roland for an opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Friend,&rsquo; said Roland, &lsquo;opinions may differ: mine is, considering the
      defences of the windows, that the only way into these houses or out of
      them bodily was the doorway.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland complimented his sister and friend on the prosecution of their
      studies: he could not understand a word of the subject, and yawning, he
      begged permission to be allowed to land and join the gondola at a distant
      quarter. The gallant officer was in haste to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee stared at her brother. He saw nothing; he said a word to the
      gondoliers, and quitted the boat. Mars was in pursuit. She resigned
      herself, and ceased then to be a girl.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. LOVE IN VENICE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The air flashed like heaven descending for Nevil alone with Renee. They
      had never been alone before. Such happiness belonged to the avenue of
      wishes leading to golden mists beyond imagination, and seemed, coming on
      him suddenly, miraculous. He leaned toward her like one who has broken a
      current of speech, and waits to resume it. She was all unsuspecting
      indolence, with gravely shadowed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I throw the book down,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She objected. &lsquo;No; continue: I like it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of them divined that the book was there to do duty for Roland.
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed it, keeping a finger among the leaves; a kind of anchorage in
      case of indiscretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Permit me to tell you, M. Nevil, you are inclined to play truant to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now is the very time to read; for my poor Roland is at sea when we
      discuss our questions, and the book has driven him away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But we have plenty of time to read. We miss the scenes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The scenes are green shutters, wet steps, barcaroli, brown women, striped
      posts, a scarlet night-cap, a sick fig-tree, an old shawl, faded spots of
      colour, peeling walls. They might be figured by a trodden melon. They all
      resemble one another, and so do the days here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the charm. I wish I could look on you and think the same. You, as
      you are, for ever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you not let me live my life?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would not have you alter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please to be pathetic on that subject after I am wrinkled, monsieur.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You want commanding, mademoiselle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee nestled her chin, and gazed forward through her eyelashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Venice is like a melancholy face of a former beauty who has ceased to
      rouge, or wipe away traces of her old arts,&rsquo; she said, straining for
      common talk, and showing the strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait; now we are rounding,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;now you have three of what you call
      your theatre-bridges in sight. The people mount and drop, mount and drop;
      I see them laugh. They are full of fun and good-temper. Look on living
      Venice!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Provided that my papa is not crossing when we go under!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would he not trust you to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He would? And you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do believe they are improvizing an operetta on the second bridge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You trust yourself willingly?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As to my second brother. You hear them? How delightfully quick and
      spontaneous they are! Ah, silly creatures! they have stopped. They might
      have held it on for us while we were passing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where would the naturalness have been then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps, M. Nevil, I do want commanding. I am wilful. Half my days will
      be spent in fits of remorse, I begin to think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come to me to be forgiven.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I? I should be forgiven too readily.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not so sure of that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you be harsh? No, not even with enemies. Least of all with... with
      us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh for the black gondola!&mdash;the little gliding dusky chamber for two;
      instead of this open, flaunting, gold and crimson cotton-work, which
      exacted discretion on his part and that of the mannerly gondoliers, and
      exposed him to window, balcony, bridge, and borderway.
    </p>
    <p>
      They slipped on beneath a red balcony where a girl leaned on her folded
      arms, and eyed them coming and going by with Egyptian gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How strange a power of looking these people have,&rsquo; said Renee, whose
      vivacity was fascinated to a steady sparkle by the girl. &lsquo;Tell me, is she
      glancing round at us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevil turned and reported that she was not. She had exhausted them while
      they were in transit; she had no minor curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us fancy she is looking for her lover,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee added: &lsquo;Let us hope she will not escape being seen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I give her my benediction,&rsquo; said Nevil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I,&rsquo; said Renee; &lsquo;and adieu to her, if you please. Look for Roland.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You remind me; I have but a few instants.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;M. Nevil, you are a preux of the times of my brother&rsquo;s patronymic. And
      there is my Roland awaiting us. Is he not handsome?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How glad you are to have him to relieve guard!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee bent on Nevil one of her singular looks of raillery. She had
      hitherto been fencing at a serious disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not so very glad,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;if that deprived me of the presence of his
      friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland was her tower. But Roland was not yet on board. She had peeped from
      her citadel too rashly. Nevil had time to spring the flood of crimson in
      her cheeks, bright as the awning she reclined under.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you have me with you always?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Assuredly,&rsquo; said she, feeling the hawk in him, and trying to baffle him
      by fluttering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Always? forever? and&mdash;listen-give me a title?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee sang out to Roland like a bird in distress, and had some trouble not
      to appear too providentially rescued. Roland on board, she resumed the
      attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;M. Nevil vows he is a better brother to me than you, who dart away on an
      impulse and leave us threading all Venice till we do not know where we
      are, naughty brother!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My little sister, the spot where you are,&rsquo; rejoined Roland, &lsquo;is precisely
      the spot where I left you, and I defy you to say you have gone on without
      me. This is the identical riva I stepped out on to buy you a packet of
      Venetian ballads.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They recognized the spot, and for a confirmation of the surprising
      statement, Roland unrolled several sheets of printed blotting-paper, and
      rapidly read part of a Canzonetta concerning Una Giovine who reproved her
      lover for his extreme addiction to wine:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
            &lsquo;Ma se, ma se,
             Cotanto beve,
             Mi no, mi no,
             No ve sposero.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This astounding vagabond preferred Nostrani to his heart&rsquo;s mistress. I
      tasted some of their Nostrani to see if it could be possible for a
      Frenchman to exonerate him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland&rsquo;s wry face at the mention of Nostrani brought out the chief
      gondolier, who delivered himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Signore, there be hereditary qualifications. One must be born Italian to
      appreciate the merits of Nostrani!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland laughed. He had covered his delinquency in leaving his sister, and
      was full of an adventure to relate to Nevil, a story promising well for
      him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. AN AWAKENING FOR BOTH
    </h2>
    <p>
      Renee was downcast. Had she not coquetted? The dear young Englishman had
      reduced her to defend herself, the which fair ladies, like besieged
      garrisons, cannot always do successfully without an attack at times,
      which, when the pursuer is ardent, is followed by a retreat, which is a
      provocation; and these things are coquettry. Her still fresh
      convent-conscience accused her of it pitilessly. She could not forgive her
      brother, and yet she dared not reproach him, for that would have
      inculpated Nevil. She stepped on to the Piazzetta thoughtfully. Her father
      was at Florian&rsquo;s, perusing letters from France. &lsquo;We are to have the
      marquis here in a week, my child,&rsquo; he said. Renee nodded. Involuntarily
      she looked at Nevil. He caught the look, with a lover&rsquo;s quick sense of
      misfortune in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard her brother reply to him: &lsquo;Who? the Marquis de Rouaillout? It is
      a jolly gaillard of fifty who spoils no fun.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mistake his age, Roland,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Forty-nine, then, my sister.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is not that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He looks it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been absent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Probably, my arithmetical sister, he has employed the interval to grow
      younger. They say it is the way with green gentlemen of a certain age.
      They advance and they retire. They perform the first steps of a quadrille
      ceremoniously, and we admire them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; exclaimed the Comte de Croisnel. &lsquo;You talk nonsense,
      Roland. M. le marquis is hardly past forty. He is in his prime.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Without question, mon pere. For me, I was merely offering proof that he
      can preserve his prime unlimitedly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is not a subject for mockery, Roland.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite the contrary; for reverence!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another than you, my boy, and he would march you out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am to imagine, then, that his hand continues firm?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Imagine to the extent of your capacity; but remember that respect is
      always owing to your own family, and deliberate before you draw on
      yourself such a chastisement as mercy from an accepted member of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland bowed and drummed on his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation had been originated by Renee for the enlightenment of
      Nevil and as a future protection to herself. Now that it had disclosed its
      burden she could look at him no more, and when her father addressed her
      significantly: &lsquo;Marquise, you did me the honour to consent to accompany me
      to the Church of the Frari this afternoon?&rsquo; she felt her self-accusation
      of coquettry biting under her bosom like a thing alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland explained the situation to Nevil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the mania with us, my dear Nevil, to marry our girls young to
      established men. Your established man carries usually all the signs,
      visible to the multitude or not, of the stages leading to that eminence.
      We cannot, I believe, unless we have the good fortune to boast the
      paternity of Hercules, disconnect ourselves from the steps we have
      mounted; not even, the priests inform us, if we are ascending to heaven;
      we carry them beyond the grave. However, it seems that our excellent
      marquis contrives to keep them concealed, and he is ready to face marriage&mdash;the
      Grandest Inquisitor, next to Death. Two furious matchmakers&mdash;our
      country, beautiful France, abounds in them&mdash;met one day; they were a
      comtesse and a baronne, and they settled the alliance. The bell was rung,
      and Renee came out of school. There is this to be said: she has no mother;
      the sooner a girl without a mother has a husband the better. That we are
      all agreed upon. I have no personal objection to the marquis; he has never
      been in any great scandals. He is Norman, and has estates in Normandy,
      Dauphiny, Touraine; he is hospitable, luxurious. Renee will have a fine
      hotel in Paris. But I am eccentric: I have read in our old Fabliaux of
      December and May. Say the marquis is November, say October; he is still
      some distance removed from the plump Spring month. And we in our family
      have wits and passions. In fine, a bud of a rose in an old gentleman&rsquo;s
      button-hole! it is a challenge to the whole world of youth; and if the bud
      should leap? Enough of this matter, friend Nevil; but sometimes a friend
      must allow himself to be bothered. I have perfect confidence in my sister,
      you see; I simply protest against her being exposed to... You know men. I
      protest, that is, in the privacy of my cigar-case, for I have no chance
      elsewhere. The affair is on wheels. The very respectable matchmakers have
      kindled the marquis on the one hand, and my father on the other, and Renee
      passes obediently from the latter to the former. In India they sacrifice
      the widows, in France the virgins.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland proceeded to relate his adventure. Nevil&rsquo;s inattention piqued him
      to salt and salt it wonderfully, until the old story of He and She had an
      exciting savour in its introductory chapter; but his friend was flying
      through the circles of the Inferno, and the babble of an ephemeral upper
      world simply affected him by its contrast with the overpowering horrors,
      repugnances, despairs, pities, rushing at him, surcharging his senses.
      Those that live much by the heart in their youth have sharp foretastes of
      the issues imaged for the soul. St. Mark&rsquo;s was in a minute struck black
      for him. He neither felt the sunlight nor understood why column and
      campanile rose, nor why the islands basked, and boats and people moved.
      All were as remote little bits of mechanism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevil escaped, and walked in the direction of the Frari down calle and
      campiello. Only to see her&mdash;to compare her with the Renee of the past
      hour! But that Renee had been all the while a feast of delusion; she could
      never be resuscitated in the shape he had known, not even clearly
      visioned. Not a day of her, not an hour, not a single look had been his
      own. She had been sold when he first beheld her, and should, he muttered
      austerely, have been ticketed the property of a middle-aged man, a
      worn-out French marquis, whom she had agreed to marry, unwooed, without
      love&mdash;the creature of a transaction. But she was innocent, she was
      unaware of the sin residing in a loveless marriage; and this restored her
      to him somewhat as a drowned body is given back to mourners.
    </p>
    <p>
      After aimless walking he found himself on the Zattere, where the lonely
      Giudecca lies in front, covering mud and marsh and lagune-flames of later
      afternoon, and you have sight of the high mainland hills which seem to
      fling forth one over other to a golden sea-cape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Midway on this unadorned Zattere, with its young trees and spots of shade,
      he was met by Renee and her father. Their gondola was below, close to the
      riva, and the count said, &lsquo;She is tired of standing gazing at pictures.
      There is a Veronese in one of the churches of the Giudecca opposite. Will
      you, M. Nevil, act as parade-escort to her here for half an hour, while I
      go over? Renee complains that she loses the vulgar art of walking in her
      complaisant attention to the fine Arts. I weary my poor child.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee protested in a rapid chatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Must I avow it?&rsquo; said the count; &lsquo;she damps my enthusiasm a little.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevil mutely accepted the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice that day was she surrendered to him: once in his ignorance, when
      time appeared an expanse of many sunny fields. On this occasion it puffed
      steam; yet, after seeing the count embark, he commenced the parade in
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is a nice walk,&rsquo; said Renee; &lsquo;we have not the steps of the Riva dei
      Schiavoni. It is rather melancholy though. How did you discover it? I
      persuaded my papa to send the gondola round, and walk till we came to the
      water. Tell me about the Giudecca.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Giudecca was a place kept apart for the Jews, I believe. You have
      seen their burial-ground on the Lido. Those are, I think, the Euganean
      hills. You are fond of Petrarch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;M. Nevil, omitting the allusion to the poet, you have, permit me to
      remark, the brevity without the precision of an accredited guide to
      notabilities.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you what I know,&rsquo; said Nevil, brooding on the finished tone and
      womanly aplomb of her language. It made him forget that she was a girl
      entrusted to his guardianship. His heart came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Renee, if you loved him, I, on my honour, would not utter a word for
      myself. Your heart&rsquo;s inclinations are sacred for me. I would stand by, and
      be your friend and his. If he were young, that I might see a chance of
      it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She murmured, &lsquo;You should not have listened to Roland.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Roland should have warned me. How could I be near you and not... But I am
      nothing. Forget me; do not think I speak interestedly, except to save the
      dearest I have ever known from certain wretchedness. To yield yourself
      hand and foot for life! I warn you that it must end miserably. Your
      countrywomen... You have the habit in France; but like what are you
      treated? You! none like you in the whole world! You consent to be
      extinguished. And I have to look on! Listen to me now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee glanced at the gondola conveying her father. And he has not yet
      landed! she thought, and said, &lsquo;Do you pretend to judge of my welfare
      better than my papa?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; in this. He follows a fashion. You submit to it. His anxiety is to
      provide for you. But I know the system is cursed by nature, and that means
      by heaven.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because it is not English?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O Renee, my beloved for ever! Well, then, tell me, tell me you can say
      with pride and happiness that the Marquis de Rouaillout is to be your&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      the word&mdash;husband!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee looked across the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Friend, if my father knew you were asking me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will speak to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Useless.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is generous, he loves you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He cannot break an engagement binding his honour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you, Renee, would you&mdash;it must be said&mdash;consent to have
      it known to him&mdash;I beg for more than life&mdash;that your are not
      averse... that you support me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His failing breath softened the bluntness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied, &lsquo;I would not have him ever break an engagement binding his
      honour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You stretch the point of honour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is our way. Dear friend, we are French. And I presume to think that
      our French system is not always wrong, for if my father had not broken it
      by treating you as one of us and leaving me with you, should I have
      heard...?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have displeased you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not suppose that. But, I mean, a mother would not have left me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wished to avoid it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not blame me. I had some instinct; you were very pale.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You knew I loved you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; for this morning...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning it seemed to me, and I regretted my fancy, that you were
      inclined to trifle, as, they say, young men do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With Renee?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With your friend Renee. And those are the hills of Petrarch&rsquo;s tomb? They
      are mountains.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were purple beneath a large brooding cloud that hung against the sun,
      waiting for him to enfold him, and Nevil thought that a tomb there would
      be a welcome end, if he might lift Renee in one wild flight over the chasm
      gaping for her. He had no language for thoughts of such a kind, only
      tumultuous feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was immoveable, in perfect armour.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said despairingly, &lsquo;Can you have realized what you are consenting to?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered, &lsquo;It is my duty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your duty! it&rsquo;s like taking up a dice-box, and flinging once, to certain
      ruin!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must oppose my father to you, friend. Do you not understand duty to
      parents? They say the English are full of the idea of duty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Duty to country, duty to oaths and obligations; but with us the heart is
      free to choose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Free to choose, and when it is most ignorant?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The heart? ask it. Nothing is surer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is not what we are taught. We are taught that the heart deceives
      itself. The heart throws your dicebox; not prudent parents.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She talked like a woman, to plead the cause of her obedience as a girl,
      and now silenced in the same manner that she had previously excited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you are lost to me,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They saw the gondola returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How swiftly it comes home; it loitered when it went,&rsquo; said Renee. &lsquo;There
      sits my father, brimming with his picture; he has seen one more! We will
      congratulate him. This little boulevard is not much to speak of. The hills
      are lovely. Friend,&rsquo; she dropped her voice on the gondola&rsquo;s approach, &lsquo;we
      have conversed on common subjects.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevil had her hand in his, to place her in the gondola.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed thankful that he should prefer to go round on foot. At least,
      she did not join in her father&rsquo;s invitation to him. She leaned back,
      nestling her chin and half closing her eyes, suffering herself to be
      divided from him, borne away by forces she acquiesced in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland was not visible till near midnight on the Piazza. The promenaders,
      chiefly military of the garrison, were few at that period of social
      protestation, and he could declare his disappointment aloud, ringingly, as
      he strolled up to Nevil, looking as if the cigar in his mouth and the
      fists entrenched in his wide trowsers-pockets were mortally at feud. His
      adventure had not pursued its course luminously. He had expected romance,
      and had met merchandize, and his vanity was offended. To pacify him, Nevil
      related how he had heard that since the Venetian rising of &lsquo;49, Venetian
      ladies had issued from the ordeal of fire and famine of another pattern
      than the famous old Benzon one, in which they touched earthiest earth. He
      praised Republicanism for that. The spirit of the new and short-lived
      Republic wrought that change in Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, if they&rsquo;re republican as well as utterly decayed,&rsquo; said Roland, &lsquo;I
      give them up; let them die virtuous.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevil told Roland that he had spoken to Renee. He won sympathy, but Roland
      could not give him encouragement. They crossed and recrossed the shadow of
      the great campanile, on the warm-white stones of the square, Nevil
      admitting the weight of whatsoever Roland pointed to him in favour of the
      arrangement according to French notions, and indeed, of aristocratic
      notions everywhere, saving that it was imperative for Renee to be disposed
      of in marriage early. Why rob her of her young springtime!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;French girls,&rsquo; replied Roland, confused by the nature of the explication
      in his head&mdash;&lsquo;well, they&rsquo;re not English; they want a hand to shape
      them, otherwise they grow all awry. My father will not have one of her
      aunts to live with him, so there she is. But, my dear Nevil, I owe my life
      to you, and I was no party to this affair. I would do anything to help
      you. What says Renee?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She obeys.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly. You see! Our girls are chess-pieces until they &lsquo;re married. Then
      they have life and character sometimes too much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is not like them, Roland; she is like none. When I spoke to her
      first, she affected no astonishment; never was there a creature so nobly
      sincere. She&rsquo;s a girl in heart, not in mind. Think of her sacrificed to
      this man thrice her age!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She differs from other girls only on the surface, Nevil. As for the man,
      I wish she were going to marry a younger. I wish, yes, my friend,&rsquo; Roland
      squeezed Nevil&rsquo;s hand, &lsquo;I wish! I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s hopeless. She did not tell
      you to hope?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not by one single sign,&rsquo; said Nevil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see, my friend!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For that reason,&rsquo; Nevil rejoined, with the calm fanaticism of the passion
      of love, &lsquo;I hope all the more... because I will not believe that she, so
      pure and good, can be sacrificed. Put me aside&mdash;I am nothing. I hope
      to save her from that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have now,&rsquo; said Roland, &lsquo;struck the current of duplicity. You are
      really in love, my poor fellow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lover and friend came to no conclusion, except that so lovely a night was
      not given for slumber. A small round brilliant moon hung almost globed in
      the depths of heaven, and the image of it fell deep between San Giorgio
      and the Dogana.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee had the scene from her window, like a dream given out of sleep. She
      lay with both arms thrown up beneath her head on the pillow, her eyelids
      wide open, and her visage set and stern. Her bosom rose and sank regularly
      but heavily. The fluctuations of a night stormy for her, hitherto unknown,
      had sunk her to this trance, in which she lay like a creature flung on
      shore by the waves. She heard her brother&rsquo;s voice and Nevil&rsquo;s, and the
      pacing of their feet. She saw the long shaft of moonlight broken to
      zigzags of mellow lightning, and wavering back to steadiness; dark San
      Giorgio, and the sheen of the Dogana&rsquo;s front. But the visible beauty
      belonged to a night that had shivered repose, humiliated and wounded her,
      destroyed her confident happy half-infancy of heart, and she had flown for
      a refuge to hard feelings. Her predominant sentiment was anger; an anger
      that touched all and enveloped none, for it was quite fictitious, though
      she felt it, and suffered from it. She turned it on Nevil, as against an
      enemy, and became the victim in his place. Tears for him filled in her
      eyes, and ran over; she disdained to notice them, and blinked offendedly
      to have her sight clear of the weakness; but these interceding tears would
      flow; it was dangerous to blame him, harshly. She let them roll down,
      figuring to herself with quiet simplicity of mind that her spirit was
      independent of them as long as she restrained her hands from being
      accomplices by brushing them away, as weeping girls do that cry for
      comfort. Nevil had saved her brother&rsquo;s life, and had succoured her
      countrymen; he loved her, and was a hero. He should not have said he loved
      her; that was wrong; and it was shameful that he should have urged her to
      disobey her father. But this hero&rsquo;s love of her might plead excuses she
      did not know of; and if he was to be excused, he, unhappy that he was, had
      a claim on her for more than tears. She wept resentfully. Forces above her
      own swayed and hurried her like a lifeless body dragged by flying wheels:
      they could not unnerve her will, or rather, what it really was, her sense
      of submission to a destiny. Looked at from the height of the palm-waving
      cherubs over the fallen martyr in the picture, she seemed as nerveless as
      a dreamy girl. The raised arms and bent elbows were an illusion of
      indifference. Her shape was rigid from hands to feet, as if to keep in a
      knot the resolution of her mind; for the second and in that young season
      the stronger nature grafted by her education fixed her to the religious
      duty of obeying and pleasing her father, in contempt, almost in
      abhorrence, of personal inclinations tending to thwart him and imperil his
      pledged word. She knew she had inclinations to be tender. Her hands
      released, how promptly might she not have been confiding her innumerable
      perplexities of sentiment and emotion to paper, undermining
      self-governance; self-respect, perhaps! Further than that, she did not
      understand the feelings she struggled with; nor had she any impulse to
      gaze on him, the cause of her trouble, who walked beside her brother
      below, talking betweenwhiles in the night&rsquo;s grave undertones. Her trouble
      was too overmastering; it had seized her too mysteriously, coming on her
      solitariness without warning in the first watch of the night, like a spark
      crackling serpentine along dry leaves to sudden flame. A thought of Nevil
      and a regret had done it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. A NIGHT ON THE ADRIATIC
    </h2>
    <p>
      The lovers met after Roland had spoken to his sister&mdash;not exactly to
      advocate the cause of Nevil, though he was under the influence of that
      grave night&rsquo;s walk with him, but to sound her and see whether she at all
      shared Nevil&rsquo;s view of her situation. Roland felt the awfulness of a
      French family arrangement of a marriage, and the impertinence of a foreign
      Cupid&rsquo;s intrusion, too keenly to plead for his friend: at the same time he
      loved his friend and his sister, and would have been very ready to smile
      blessings on them if favourable circumstances had raised a signal; if, for
      example, apoplexy or any other cordial ex machina intervention had removed
      the middle-aged marquis; and, perhaps, if Renee had shown the repugnance
      to her engagement which Nevil declared she must have in her heart, he
      would have done more than smile; he would have laid the case deferentially
      before his father. His own opinion was that young unmarried women were
      incapable of the passion of love, being, as it were, but half-feathered in
      that state, and unable to fly; and Renee confirmed it. The suspicion of an
      advocacy on Nevil&rsquo;s behalf steeled her. His tentative observations were
      checked at the outset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can such things be spoken of to me, Roland? I am plighted. You know it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged, said a word of pity for Nevil, and went forth to let his
      friend know that it was as he had predicted: Renee was obedience in
      person, like a rightly educated French girl. He strongly advised his
      friend to banish all hope of her from his mind. But the mind he addressed
      was of a curious order; far-shooting, tough, persistent, and when acted on
      by the spell of devotion, indomitable. Nevil put hope aside, or rather, he
      clad it in other garments, in which it was hardly to be recognized by
      himself, and said to Roland: &lsquo;You must bear this from me; you must let me
      follow you to the end, and if she wavers she will find me near.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland could not avoid asking the use of it, considering that Renee,
      however much she admired and liked, was not in love with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevil resigned himself to admit that she was not: and therefore,&rsquo; said he,
      &lsquo;you won&rsquo;t object to my remaining.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee greeted Nevil with as clear a conventional air as a woman could
      assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was going, she said, to attend High Mass in the church of S. Moise,
      and she waved her devoutest Roman Catholicism to show the breadth of the
      division between them. He proposed to go likewise. She was mute. After
      some discourse she contrived to say inoffensively that people who strolled
      into her churches for the music, or out of curiosity, played the
      barbarian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I will not go,&rsquo; said Nevil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I do not wish to number you among them,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said Nevil, &lsquo;I will go, for it cannot be barbarous to try to be
      with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, that is wickedness,&rsquo; said Renee.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sensible that conversation betrayed her, and Nevil&rsquo;s apparently
      deliberate pursuit signified to her that he must be aware of his mastery,
      and she resented it, and stumbled into pitfalls whenever she opened her
      lips. It seemed to be denied to them to utter what she meant, if indeed
      she had a meaning in speaking, save to hurt herself cruelly by wounding
      the man who had caught her in the toils: and so long as she could imagine
      that she was the only one hurt, she was the braver and the harsher for it;
      but at the sight of Nevil in pain her heart relented and shifted, and
      discovering it to be so weak as to be almost at his mercy, she defended it
      with an aggressive unkindness, for which, in charity to her sweeter
      nature, she had to ask his pardon, and then had to fib to give reasons for
      her conduct, and then to pretend to herself that her pride was humbled by
      him; a most humiliating round, constantly recurring; the worse for the
      reflection that she created it. She attempted silence. Nevil spoke, and
      was like the magical piper: she was compelled to follow him and dance the
      round again, with the wretched thought that it must resemble coquettry.
      Nevil did not think so, but a very attentive observer now upon the scene,
      and possessed of his half of the secret, did, and warned him. Rosamund
      Culling added that the French girl might be only an unconscious coquette,
      for she was young. The critic would not undertake to pronounce on her
      suggestion, whether the candour apparent in merely coquettish instincts
      was not more dangerous than a battery of the arts of the sex. She had
      heard Nevil&rsquo;s frank confession, and seen Renee twice, when she tried in
      his service, though not greatly wishing for success, to stir the sensitive
      girl for an answer to his attachment. Probably she went to work
      transparently, after the insular fashion of opening a spiritual mystery
      with the lancet. Renee suffered herself to be probed here and there, and
      revealed nothing of the pain of the operation. She said to Nevil, in
      Rosamund&rsquo;s hearing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you the sense of honour acute in your country?&rsquo; Nevil inquired for
      the apropos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such pointed insolence disposed Rosamund to an irritable antagonism,
      without reminding her that she had given some cause for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee said to her presently: &lsquo;He saved my brother&rsquo;s life&rsquo;; the apropos
      being as little perceptible as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice dropped to her sweetest deep tones, and there was a supplicating
      beam in her eyes, unintelligible to the direct Englishwoman, except under
      the heading of a power of witchery fearful to think of in one so young,
      and loved by Nevil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The look was turned upon her, not upon her hero, and Rosamund thought,
      &lsquo;Does she want to entangle me as well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, in truth, a look of entreaty from woman to woman, signifying need
      of womanly help. Renee would have made a confidante of her, if she had not
      known her to be Nevil&rsquo;s, and devoted to him. &lsquo;I would speak to you, but
      that I feel you would betray me,&rsquo; her eyes had said. The strong sincerity
      dwelling amid multiform complexities might have made itself comprehensible
      to the English lady for a moment or so, had Renee spoken words to her
      ears; but belief in it would hardly have survived the girl&rsquo;s next
      convolutions. &lsquo;She is intensely French,&rsquo; Rosamund said to Nevil&mdash;a
      volume of insular criticism in a sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do not know her, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Nevil. &lsquo;You think her older than she
      is, and that is the error I fell into. She is a child.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A serpent in the egg is none the less a serpent, Nevil. Forgive me; but
      when she tells you the case is hopeless!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No case is hopeless till a man consents to think it is; and I shall
      stay.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But then again, Nevil, you have not consulted your uncle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let him see her! let him only see her!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund Culling reserved her opinion compassionately. His uncle would
      soon be calling to have him home: society panted for him to make much of
      him and here he was, cursed by one of his notions of duty, in attendance
      on a captious &lsquo;young French beauty, who was the less to be excused for not
      dismissing him peremptorily, if she cared for him at all. His career,
      which promised to be so brilliant, was spoiling at the outset. Rosamund
      thought of Renee almost with detestation, as a species of sorceress that
      had dug a trench in her hero&rsquo;s road, and unhorsed and fast fettered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis was expected immediately. Renee sent up a little note to Mrs.
      Calling&rsquo;s chamber early in the morning, and it was with an air of
      one-day-more-to-ourselves, that, meeting her, she entreated the English
      lady to join the expedition mentioned in her note. Roland had hired a big
      Chioggian fishing-boat to sail into the gulf at night, and return at dawn,
      and have sight of Venice rising from the sea. Her father had declined; but
      M. Nevil wished to be one of the party, and in that case.... Renee threw
      herself beseechingly into the mute interrogation, keeping both of
      Rosamund&rsquo;s hands. They could slip away only by deciding to, and this rare
      Englishwoman had no taste for the petty overt hostilities. &lsquo;If I can be of
      use to you,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you can bear sea-pitching and tossing for the sake of the loveliest
      sight in the whole world,&rsquo; said Renee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it well,&rsquo; Rosamund replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee rippled her eyebrows. She divined a something behind that remark,
      and as she was aware of the grief of Rosamund&rsquo;s life, her quick intuition
      whispered that it might be connected with the gallant officer dead on the
      battle-field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madame, if you know it too well...&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; it is always worth seeing,&rsquo; said Rosamund, &lsquo;and I think,
      mademoiselle, with your permission, I should accompany you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is only a whim of mine, madame. I can stay on shore.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not when it is unnecessary to forego a pleasure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say, my last day of freedom.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee kissed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is terribly winning, Rosamund avowed. Renee was in debate whether the
      woman devoted to Nevil would hear her and help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Roland and Nevil returned from their boat, where they had left
      carpenters and upholsterers at work, and the delicate chance for an
      understanding between the ladies passed by.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young men were like waves of ocean overwhelming it, they were so full
      of their boat, and the scouring and cleaning out of it, and provisioning,
      and making it worthy of its freight. Nevil was surprised that Mrs. Culling
      should have consented to come, and asked her if she really wished it&mdash;really;
      and &lsquo;Really,&rsquo; said Rosamund; &lsquo;certainly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Without dubitation,&rsquo; cried Roland. &lsquo;And now my little Renee has no more
      shore-qualms; she is smoothly chaperoned, and madame will present us tea
      on board. All the etcaeteras of life are there, and a mariner&rsquo;s eye in me
      spies a breeze at sunset to waft us out of Malamocco.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The count listened to the recital of their preparations with his usual
      absent interest in everything not turning upon Art, politics, or social
      intrigue. He said, &lsquo;Yes, good, good,&rsquo; at the proper intervals, and walked
      down the riva to look at the busy boat, said to Nevil, &lsquo;You are a sailor;
      I confide my family to you,&rsquo; and prudently counselled Renee to put on the
      dresses she could toss to the deep without regrets. Mrs. Culling he
      thanked fervently for a wonderful stretch of generosity in lending her
      presence to the madcaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether the day was a reanimation of external Venice. But there was a
      thunderbolt in it; for about an hour before sunset, when the ladies were
      superintending and trying not to criticize the ingenious efforts to
      produce a make-believe of comfort on board for them, word was brought down
      to the boat by the count&rsquo;s valet that the Marquis de Rouaillout had
      arrived. Renee turned her face to her brother superciliously. Roland
      shrugged. &lsquo;Note this, my sister,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;an anticipation of dates in
      paying visits precludes the ripeness of the sentiment of welcome. It is,
      however, true that the marquis has less time to spare than others.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have started; we are on the open sea. How can we put back?&rsquo; said
      Renee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You hear, Francois; we are on the open sea,&rsquo; Roland addressed the valet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monsieur has cut loose his communications with land,&rsquo; Francois responded,
      and bowed from the landing.

      Nevil hastened to make this a true report; but they had to wait for tide
      as well as breeze, and pilot through intricate mud-channels before they
      could see the outside of the Lido, and meanwhile the sun lay like a golden
      altarplatter on mud-banks made bare by the ebb, and curled in drowsy
      yellow links along the currents. All they could do was to push off and
      hang loose, bumping to right and left in the midst of volleys and
      countervolleys of fishy Venetian, Chioggian, and Dalmatian, quite as
      strong as anything ever heard down the Canalaggio. The representatives of
      these dialects trotted the decks and hung their bodies half over the sides
      of the vessels to deliver fire, flashed eyes and snapped fingers, not a
      whit less fierce than hostile crews in the old wars hurling an interchange
      of stink-pots, and then resumed the trot, apparently in search of fresh
      ammunition. An Austrian sentinel looked on passively, and a police
      inspector peeringly. They were used to it. Happily, the combustible import
      of the language was unknown to the ladies, and Nevil&rsquo;s attempts to keep
      his crew quiet, contrasting with Roland&rsquo;s phlegm, which a Frenchman can
      assume so philosophically when his tongue is tied, amused them. During the
      clamour, Renee saw her father beckoning from the riva. She signified that
      she was no longer in command of circumstances; the vessel was off. But the
      count stamped his foot, and nodded imperatively. Thereupon Roland repeated
      the eloquent demonstrations of Renee, and the count lost patience, and
      Roland shouted, &lsquo;For the love of heaven, don&rsquo;t join this babel; we&rsquo;re
      nearly bursting.&rsquo; The rage of the babel was allayed by degrees, though not
      appeased, for the boat was behaving wantonly, as the police officer
      pointed out to the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee stood up to bend her head. It was in reply to a salute from the
      Marquis de Rouaillout, and Nevil beheld his rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;M. le Marquis, seeing it is out of the question that we can come to you,
      will you come to us?&rsquo; cried Roland.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis gesticulated &lsquo;With alacrity&rsquo; in every limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will bring you back on to-morrow midnight&rsquo;s tide, safe, we promise
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis advanced a foot, and withdrew it. Could he have heard
      correctly? They were to be out a whole night at sea! The count dejectedly
      confessed his incapability to restrain them: the young desperadoes were
      ready for anything. He had tried the voice of authority, and was laughed
      at. As to Renee, an English lady was with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The English lady must be as mad as the rest,&rsquo; said the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The English are mad,&rsquo; said the count; &lsquo;but their women are strict upon
      the proprieties.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Possibly, my dear count; but what room is there for the proprieties on
      board a fishing-boat?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is even as you say, my dear marquis.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You allow it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can I help myself? Look at them. They tell me they have given the boat
      the fittings of a yacht.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the young man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is the M. Beauchamp of whom I have spoken to you, the very pick of
      his country, fresh, lively, original; and he can converse. You will like
      him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope so,&rsquo; said the marquis, and roused a doleful laugh. &lsquo;It would seem
      that one does not arrive by hastening!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! but my dear marquis, you have paid the compliment; you are like
      Spring thrusting in a bunch of lilac while the winds of winter blow. If
      you were not expected, your expeditiousness is appreciated, be sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland fortunately did not hear the marquis compared to Spring. He was
      saying: &lsquo;I wonder what those two elderly gentlemen are talking about&rsquo;; and
      Nevil confused his senses by trying to realize that one of them was
      destined to be the husband of his now speechless Renee. The marquis was
      clad in a white silken suit, and a dash of red round the neck set off his
      black beard; but when he lifted his broad straw hat, a baldness of sconce
      shone. There was elegance in his gestures; he looked a gentleman, though
      an ultra-Gallican one, that is, too scrupulously finished for our taste,
      smelling of the valet. He had the habit of balancing his body on the hips,
      as if to emphasize a juvenile vigour, and his general attitude suggested
      an idea that he had an oration for you. Seen from a distance, his baldness
      and strong nasal projection were not winning features; the youthful
      standard he had evidently prescribed to himself in his dress and his ready
      jerks of acquiescence and delivery might lead a forlorn rival to conceive
      him something of an ogre straining at an Adonis. It could not be disputed
      that he bore his disappointment remarkably well; the more laudably,
      because his position was within a step of the ridiculous, for he had shot
      himself to the mark, despising sleep, heat, dust, dirt, diet, and lo, that
      charming object was deliberately slipping out of reach, proving his
      headlong journey an absurdity.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood declining to participate in the lunatic voyage, and bidding
      them perforce good speed off the tips of his fingers, Renee turned her
      eyes on him, and away. She felt a little smart of pity, arising partly
      from her antagonism to Roland&rsquo;s covert laughter: but it was the colder
      kind of feminine pity, which is nearer to contempt than to tenderness. She
      sat still, placid outwardly, in fear of herself, so strange she found it
      to be borne out to sea by her sailor lover under the eyes of her
      betrothed. She was conscious of a tumultuous rush of sensations, none of
      them of a very healthy kind, coming as it were from an unlocked chamber of
      her bosom, hitherto of unimagined contents; and the marquis being now on
      the spot to defend his own, she no longer blamed Nevil: it was otherwise
      utterly. All the sweeter side of pity was for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was at first amazed by the sudden exquisite transition. Tenderness
      breathed from her, in voice, in look, in touch; for she accepted his help
      that he might lead her to the stern of the vessel, to gaze well on setting
      Venice, and sent lightnings up his veins; she leaned beside him over the
      vessel&rsquo;s rails, not separated from him by the breadth of a fluttering
      riband. Like him, she scarcely heard her brother when for an instant he
      intervened, and with Nevil she said adieu to Venice, where the faint red
      Doge&rsquo;s palace was like the fading of another sunset north-westward of the
      glory along the hills. Venice dropped lower and lower, breasting the
      waters, until it was a thin line in air. The line was broken, and ran in
      dots, with here and there a pillar standing on opal sky. At last the
      topmost campanile sank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee looked up at the sails, and back for the submerged city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is gone!&rsquo; she said, as though a marvel had been worked; and swiftly:
      &lsquo;we have one night!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She breathed it half like a question, like a petition, catching her
      breath. The adieu to Venice was her assurance of liberty, but Venice
      hidden rolled on her the sense of the return and plucked shrewdly at her
      tether of bondage.
    </p>
    <p>
      They set their eyes toward the dark gulf ahead. The night was growing
      starry. The softly ruffled Adriatic tossed no foam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One night?&rsquo; said Nevil; &lsquo;one? Why only one?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee shuddered. &lsquo;Oh! do not speak.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, give me your hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, my friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed a hand that was like a quivering chord. She gave it as though
      it had been his own to claim. But that it meant no more than a hand he
      knew by the very frankness of her compliance, in the manner natural to
      her; and this was the charm, it filled him with her peculiar image and
      spirit, and while he held it he was subdued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lying on the deck at midnight, wrapt in his cloak and a coil of rope for a
      pillow, considerably apart from jesting Roland, the recollection of that
      little sanguine spot of time when Renee&rsquo;s life-blood ran with his, began
      to heave under him like a swelling sea. For Nevil the starred black night
      was Renee. Half his heart was in it: but the combative division flew to
      the morning and the deadly iniquity of the marriage, from which he
      resolved to save her; in pure devotedness, he believed. And so he closed
      his eyes. She, a girl, with a heart fluttering open and fearing, felt only
      that she had lost herself somewhere, and she had neither sleep nor
      symbols, nothing but a sense of infinite strangeness, as though she were
      borne superhumanly through space.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. MORNING AT SEA UNDER THE ALPS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The breeze blew steadily, enough to swell the sails and sweep the vessel
      on smoothly. The night air dropped no moisture on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevil Beauchamp dozed for an hour. He was awakened by light on his
      eyelids, and starting up beheld the many pinnacles of grey and red rocks
      and shadowy high white regions at the head of the gulf waiting for the
      sun; and the sun struck them. One by one they came out in crimson flame,
      till the vivid host appeared to have stepped forward. The shadows on the
      snow-fields deepened to purple below an irradiation of rose and pink and
      dazzling silver. There of all the world you might imagine Gods to sit. A
      crowd of mountains endless in range, erect, or flowing, shattered and
      arid, or leaning in smooth lustre, hangs above the gulf. The mountains are
      sovereign Alps, and the sea is beneath them. The whole gigantic body keeps
      the sea, as with a hand, to right and left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevil&rsquo;s personal rapture craved for Renee with the second long breath he
      drew; and now the curtain of her tent-cabin parted, and greeting him with
      a half smile, she looked out. The Adriatic was dark, the Alps had heaven
      to themselves. Crescents and hollows, rosy mounds, white shelves, shining
      ledges, domes and peaks, all the towering heights were in illumination
      from Friuli into farthest Tyrol; beyond earth to the stricken senses of
      the gazers. Colour was stedfast on the massive front ranks: it wavered in
      the remoteness, and was quick and dim as though it fell on beating wings;
      but there too divine colour seized and shaped forth solid forms, and
      thence away to others in uttermost distances where the incredible
      flickering gleam of new heights arose, that soared, or stretched their
      white uncertain curves in sky like wings traversing infinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed unlike morning to the lovers, but as if night had broken with a
      revelation of the kingdom in the heart of night. While the broad smooth
      waters rolled unlighted beneath that transfigured upper sphere, it was
      possible to think the scene might vanish like a view caught out of
      darkness by lightning. Alp over burning Alp, and around them a hueless
      dawn! The two exulted they threw off the load of wonderment, and in
      looking they had the delicious sensation of flight in their veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee stole toward Nevil. She was mystically shaken and at his mercy; and
      had he said then, &lsquo;Over to the other land, away from Venice!&rsquo; she would
      have bent her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked his permission to rouse her brother and madame, so that they
      should not miss the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland lay in the folds of his military greatcoat, too completely happy to
      be disturbed, Nevil Beauchamp chose to think; and Rosamund Culling, he
      told Renee, had been separated from her husband last on these waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! to be unhappy here,&rsquo; sighed Renee. &lsquo;I fancied it when I begged her to
      join us. It was in her voice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The impressionable girl trembled. He knew he was dear to her, and for that
      reason, judging of her by himself, he forbore to urge his advantage,
      conceiving it base to fear that loving him she could yield her hand to
      another; and it was the critical instant. She was almost in his grasp. A
      word of sharp entreaty would have swung her round to see her situation
      with his eyes, and detest and shrink from it. He committed the capital
      fault of treating her as his equal in passion and courage, not as metal
      ready to run into the mould under temporary stress of fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even later in the morning, when she was cooler and he had come to speak,
      more than her own strength was needed to resist him. The struggle was
      hard. The boat&rsquo;s head had been put about for Venice, and they were among
      the dusky-red Chioggian sails in fishing quarters, expecting momently a
      campanile to signal the sea-city over the level. Renee waited for it in
      suspense. To her it stood for the implacable key of a close and stifling
      chamber, so different from this brilliant boundless region of air, that
      she sickened with the apprehension; but she knew it must appear, and soon,
      and therewith the contraction and the gloom it indicated to her mind. He
      talked of the beauty. She fretted at it, and was her petulant self again
      in an epigrammatic note of discord.
    </p>
    <p>
      He let that pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Last night you said &ldquo;one night,&rdquo;&rsquo; he whispered. &lsquo;We will have another
      sail before we leave Venice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One night, and in a little time one hour! and next one minute! and
      there&rsquo;s the end,&rsquo; said Renee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tone alarmed him. &lsquo;Have you forgotten that you gave me your hand?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I gave my hand to my friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You gave it to me for good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; I dared not; it is not mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is mine,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee pointed to the dots and severed lines and isolated columns of the
      rising city, black over bright sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mine there as well as here,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, and looked at her with the
      fiery zeal of eyes intent on minutest signs for a confirmation, to shake
      that sad negation of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Renee, you cannot break the pledge of the hand you gave me last night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You tell me how weak a creature I am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are me, myself; more, better than me. And say, would you not rather
      coast here and keep the city under water?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not refrain from confessing that she would be glad never to land
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So, when you land, go straight to your father,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, to whose
      conception it was a simple act resulting from the avowal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! you torture me,&rsquo; she cried. Her eyelashes were heavy with tears. &lsquo;I
      cannot do it. Think what you will of me! And, my friend, help me. Should
      you not help me? I have not once actually disobeyed my father, and he has
      indulged me, but he has been sure of me as a dutiful girl. That is my
      source of self-respect. My friend can always be my friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, while it&rsquo;s not too late,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      She observed a sudden stringing of his features. He called to the chief
      boatman, made his command intelligible to that portly capitano, and went
      on to Roland, who was puffing his after-breakfast cigarette in
      conversation with the tolerant English lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You condescend to notice us, Signor Beauchamp,&rsquo; said Roland. &lsquo;The vessel
      is up to some manoeuvre?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have decided not to land,&rsquo; replied Beauchamp. &lsquo;And Roland,&rsquo; he checked
      the Frenchman&rsquo;s shout of laughter, &lsquo;I think of making for Trieste. Let me
      speak to you, to both. Renee is in misery. She must not go back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland sprang to his feet, stared, and walked over to Renee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil,&rsquo; said Rosamund Culling, &lsquo;do you know what you are doing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perfectly,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Come to her. She is a girl, and I must think and
      act for her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland met them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Nevil, are you in a state of delusion? Renee denies...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no delusion, Roland. I am determined to stop a catastrophe. I see
      it as plainly as those Alps. There is only one way, and that&rsquo;s the one I
      have chosen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chosen! my friend&rsquo;. But allow me to remind you that you have others to
      consult. And Renee herself...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is a girl. She loves me, and I speak for her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has said it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has more than said it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You strike me to the deck, Nevil. Either you are downright mad&mdash;which
      seems the likeliest, or we are all in a nightmare. Can you suppose I will
      let my sister be carried away the deuce knows where, while her father is
      expecting her, and to fulfil an engagement affecting his pledged word?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp simply replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come to her.&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. A SINGULAR COUNCIL
    </h2>
    <p>
      The four sat together under the shadow of the helmsman, by whom they were
      regarded as voyagers in debate upon the question of some hours further on
      salt water. &lsquo;No bora,&rsquo; he threw in at intervals, to assure them that the
      obnoxious wind of the Adriatic need not disturb their calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an extraordinary sitting, but none of the parties to it thought of
      it so when Nevil Beauchamp had plunged them into it. He compelled them,
      even Renee&mdash;and she would have flown had there been wings on her
      shoulders&mdash;to feel something of the life and death issues present to
      his soul, and submit to the discussion, in plain language of the
      market-place, of the most delicate of human subjects for her, for him, and
      hardly less for the other two. An overmastering fervour can do this. It
      upsets the vessel we float in, and we have to swim our way out of deep
      waters by the directest use of the natural faculties, without much
      reflection on the change in our habits. To others not under such an
      influence the position seems impossible. This discussion occurred.
      Beauchamp opened the case in a couple of sentences, and when the turn came
      for Renee to speak, and she shrank from the task in manifest pain, he
      spoke for her, and no one heard her contradiction. She would have wished
      the fearful impetuous youth to succeed if she could have slept through the
      storm he was rousing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland appealed to her. &lsquo;You! my sister! it is you that consent to this
      wild freak, enough to break your father&rsquo;s heart?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had really forgotten his knowledge of her character&mdash;what much he
      knew&mdash;in the dust of the desperation flung about her by Nevil
      Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head; she had not consented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The man she loves is her voice and her will,&rsquo; said Beauchamp. &lsquo;She gives
      me her hand and I lead her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland questioned her. It could not be denied that she had given her hand,
      and her bewildered senses made her think that it had been with an entire
      abandonment; and in the heat of her conflict of feelings, the
      deliciousness of yielding to him curled round and enclosed her, as in a
      cool humming sea-shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Renee!&rsquo; said Roland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brother!&rsquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see that I cannot suffer you to be borne away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; do not!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the boat was flying fast from Venice, and she could have fallen at his
      feet and kissed them for not countermanding it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are in my charge, my sister.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now, Nevil, between us two,&rsquo; said Roland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp required no challenge. He seemed, to Rosamund Culling, twice
      older than he was, strangely adept, yet more strangely wise of worldly
      matters, and eloquent too. But it was the eloquence of frenzy, madness, in
      Roland&rsquo;s ear. The arrogation of a terrible foresight that harped on
      present and future to persuade him of the righteousness of this headlong
      proceeding advocated by his friend, vexed his natural equanimity. The
      argument was out of the domain of logic. He could hardly sit to listen,
      and tore at his moustache at each end. Nevertheless his sister listened.
      The mad Englishman accomplished the miracle of making her listen, and
      appear to consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland laughed scornfully. &lsquo;Why Trieste? I ask you, why Trieste? You can&rsquo;t
      have a Catholic priest at your bidding, without her father&rsquo;s sanction.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We leave Renee at Trieste, under the care of madame,&rsquo; said Beauchamp,
      &lsquo;and we return to Venice, and I go to your father. This method protects
      Renee from annoyance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It strikes me that if she arrives at any determination she must take the
      consequences.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She does. She is brave enough for that. But she is a girl; she has to
      fight the battle of her life in a day, and I am her lover, and she leaves
      it to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is my sister such a coward?&rsquo; said Roland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee could only call out his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will never do, my dear Nevil; Roland tried to deal with his
      unreasonable friend affectionately. &lsquo;I am responsible for her. It&rsquo;s your
      own fault&mdash;if you had not saved my life I should not have been in
      your way. Here I am, and your proposal can&rsquo;t be heard of. Do as you will,
      both of you, when you step ashore in Venice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If she goes back she is lost,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, and he attacked Roland on
      the side of his love for Renee, and for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland was inflexible. Seeing which, Renee said, &lsquo;To Venice, quickly, my
      brother!&rsquo; and now she almost sighed with relief to think that she was
      escaping from this hurricane of a youth, who swept her off her feet and
      wrapt her whole being in a delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We were in sight of the city just now!&rsquo; cried Roland, staring and
      frowning. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp answered him calmly, &lsquo;The boat&rsquo;s under my orders.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Talk madness, but don&rsquo;t act it,&rsquo; said Roland. &lsquo;Round with the boat at
      once. Hundred devils! you haven&rsquo;t your wits.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To his amazement, Beauchamp refused to alter the boat&rsquo;s present course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You heard my sister?&rsquo; said Roland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You frighten her,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You heard her wish to return to Venice, I say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has no wish that is not mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It came to Roland&rsquo;s shouting his command to the men, while Beauchamp
      pointed the course on for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will make this a ghastly pleasantry,&rsquo; said Roland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do what I know to be right,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You want an altercation before these fellows?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There won&rsquo;t be one; they obey me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland blinked rapidly in wrath and doubt of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madame,&rsquo; he stooped to Rosamund Culling, with a happy inspiration,
      &lsquo;convince him; you have known him longer than I, and I desire not to lose
      my friend. And tell me, madame&mdash;I can trust you to be truth itself,
      and you can see it is actually the time for truth to be spoken&mdash;is he
      justified in taking my sister&rsquo;s hand? You perceive that I am obliged to
      appeal to you. Is he not dependent on his uncle? And is he not, therefore,
      in your opinion, bound in reason as well as in honour to wait for his
      uncle&rsquo;s approbation before he undertakes to speak for my sister? And,
      since the occasion is urgent, let me ask you one thing more: whether, by
      your knowledge of his position, you think him entitled to presume to
      decide upon my sister&rsquo;s destiny? She, you are aware, is not so young but
      that she can speak for herself...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There you are wrong, Roland,&rsquo; said Beauchamp; &lsquo;she can neither speak nor
      think for herself: you lead her blindfolded.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you, my friend, suppose that you are wiser than any of us. It is
      understood. I venture to appeal to madame on the point in question.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor lady&rsquo;s heart beat dismally. She was constrained to answer, and
      said, &lsquo;His uncle is one who must be consulted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You hear that, Nevil,&rsquo; said Roland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp looked at her sharply; angrily, Rosamund feared. She had struck
      his hot brain with the vision of Everard Romfrey as with a bar of iron. If
      Rosamund had inclined to the view that he was sure of his uncle&rsquo;s support,
      it would have seemed to him a simple confirmation of his sentiments, but
      he was not of the same temper now as when he exclaimed, &lsquo;Let him see her!&rsquo; 
      and could imagine, give him only Renee&rsquo;s love, the world of men
      subservient to his wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he was dreaming; he was now in fiery earnest, for that reason
      accessible to facts presented to him; and Rosamund&rsquo;s reluctantly spoken
      words brought his stubborn uncle before his eyes, inflicting a sense of
      helplessness of the bitterest kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all silent. Beauchamp stared at the lines of the deck-planks.
    </p>
    <p>
      His scheme to rescue Renee was right and good; but was he the man that
      should do it? And was she, moreover, he thought&mdash;speculating on her
      bent head&mdash;the woman to be forced to brave the world with him, and
      poverty? She gave him no sign. He was assuredly not the man to pretend to
      powers he did not feel himself to possess, and though from a personal, and
      still more from a lover&rsquo;s, inability to see all round him at one time and
      accurately to weigh the forces at his disposal, he had gone far, he was
      not a wilful dreamer nor so very selfish a lover. The instant his
      consciousness of a superior strength failed him he acknowledged it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee did not look up. She had none of those lightnings of primitive
      energy, nor the noble rashness and reliance on her lover, which his
      imagination had filled her with; none. That was plain. She could not even
      venture to second him. Had she done so he would have held out. He walked
      to the head of the boat without replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after this the boat was set for Venice again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he rejoined his companions he kissed Rosamund&rsquo;s hand, and Renee,
      despite a confused feeling of humiliation and anger, loved him for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glittering Venice was now in sight; the dome of Sta. Maria Salute shining
      like a globe of salt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland flung his arm round his friend&rsquo;s neck, and said, &lsquo;Forgive me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do what you think right,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a perfect man of honour, my friend, and a woman would adore you.
      Girls are straws. It&rsquo;s part of Renee&rsquo;s religion to obey her father. That&rsquo;s
      why I was astonished!... I owe you my life, and I would willingly give you
      my sister in part payment, if I had the giving of her; most willingly. The
      case is, that she&rsquo;s a child, and you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m dependent,&rsquo; Beauchamp assented. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t act; I see it. That
      scheme wants two to carry it out: she has no courage. I feel that I could
      carry the day with my uncle, but I can&rsquo;t subject her to the risks, since
      she dreads them; I see it. Yes, I see that! I should have done well, I
      believe; I should have saved her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Run to England, get your uncle&rsquo;s consent, and then try.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; I shall go to her father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Nevil, and supposing you have Renee to back you&mdash;supposing
      it, I say&mdash;won&rsquo;t you be falling on exactly the same bayonet-point?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I leave her!&rsquo; Beauchamp interjected. He perceived the quality of
      Renee&rsquo;s unformed character which he could not express.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But we are to suppose that she loves you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is a girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You return, my friend, to the place you started from, as you did on the
      canal without knowing it. In my opinion, frankly, she is best married. And
      I think so all the more after this morning&rsquo;s lesson. You understand
      plainly that if you leave her she will soon be pliant to the legitimate
      authorities; and why not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen to me, Roland. I tell you she loves me. I am bound to her, and
      when&mdash;if ever I see her unhappy, I will not stand by and look on
      quietly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland shrugged. &lsquo;The future not being born, my friend, we will abstain
      from baptizing it. For me, less privileged than my fellows, I have never
      seen the future. Consequently I am not in love with it, and to declare
      myself candidly I do not care for it one snap of the fingers. Let us
      follow our usages, and attend to the future at the hour of its delivery. I
      prefer the sage-femme to the prophet. From my heart, Nevil, I wish I could
      help you. We have charged great guns together, but a family arrangement is
      something different from a hostile battery. There&rsquo;s Venice! and, as soon
      as you land, my responsibility&rsquo;s ended. Reflect, I pray you, on what I
      have said about girls. Upon my word, I discover myself talking wisdom to
      you. Girls are precious fragilities. Marriage is the mould for them; they
      get shape, substance, solidity: that is to say, sense, passion, a will of
      their own: and grace and tenderness, delicacy; all out of the rude, raw,
      quaking creatures we call girls. Paris! my dear Nevil. Paris! It&rsquo;s the
      book of women.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The grandeur of the decayed sea-city, where folly had danced Parisianly of
      old, spread brooding along the waters in morning light; beautiful; but
      with that inner light of history seen through the beauty Venice was like a
      lowered banner. The great white dome and the campanili watching above her
      were still brave emblems. Would Paris leave signs of an ancient vigour
      standing to vindicate dignity when her fall came? Nevil thought of Renee
      in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      She avoided him. She had retired behind her tent-curtains, and reappeared
      only when her father&rsquo;s voice hailed the boat from a gondola. The count and
      the marquis were sitting together, and there was a spare gondola for the
      voyagers, so that they should not have to encounter another babel of the
      riva. Salutes were performed with lifted hats, nods, and bows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, my dear child, it has all been very wonderful and uncomfortable?&rsquo; 
      said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wonderful, papa; splendid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No qualms of any kind?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None, I assure you.&rsquo; And madame?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madame will confirm it, if you find a seat for her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund Culling was received in the count&rsquo;s gondola, cordially thanked,
      and placed beside the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I stay on board and pay these fellows,&rsquo; said Roland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee was told by her father to follow madame. He had jumped into the
      spare gondola and offered a seat to Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; cried Renee, arresting Beauchamp, &lsquo;it is I who mean to sit with
      papa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Up sprang the marquis with an entreating, &lsquo;Mademoiselle!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;M. Beauchamp will entertain you, M. le Marquis.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want him here,&rsquo; said the count; and Beauchamp showed that his wish was
      to enter the count&rsquo;s gondola, but Renee had recovered her aplomb, and
      decisively said &lsquo;No,&rsquo; and Beauchamp had to yield.
    </p>
    <p>
      That would have been an opportunity of speaking to her father without a
      formal asking of leave. She knew it as well as Nevil Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee took his hand to be assisted in the step down to her father&rsquo;s arms,
      murmuring:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do nothing&mdash;nothing! until you hear from me.&rsquo;

      CHAPTER XI. CAPTAIN BASKELETT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our England, meanwhile, was bustling over the extinguished war, counting
      the cost of it, with a rather rueful eye on Manchester, and soothing the
      taxed by an exhibition of heroes at brilliant feasts. Of course, the first
      to come home had the cream of the praises. She hugged them in a manner
      somewhat suffocating to modest men, but heroism must be brought to bear
      upon these excesses of maternal admiration; modesty, too, when it accepts
      the place of honour at a public banquet, should not protest overmuch. To
      be just, the earliest arrivals, which were such as reached the shores of
      Albion before her war was at an end, did cordially reciprocate the hug.
      They were taught, and they believed most naturally, that it was quite as
      well to repose upon her bosom as to have stuck to their posts. Surely
      there was a conscious weakness in the Spartans, who were always at pains
      to discipline their men in heroical conduct, and rewarded none save the
      stand-fasts. A system of that sort seems to betray the sense of poverty in
      the article. Our England does nothing like it. All are welcome home to her
      so long as she is in want of them. Besides, she has to please the
      taxpayer. You may track a shadowy line or crazy zigzag of policy in almost
      every stroke of her domestic history: either it is the forethought finding
      it necessary to stir up an impulse, or else dashing impulse gives a lively
      pull to the afterthought: policy becomes evident somehow, clumsily very
      possibly. How can she manage an enormous middle-class, to keep it happy,
      other than a little clumsily? The managing of it at all is the wonder. And
      not only has she to stupefy the taxpayer by a timely display of feastings
      and fireworks, she has to stop all that nonsense (to quote a satiated man
      lightened in his purse) at the right moment, about the hour when the old
      standfasts, who have simply been doing duty, return, poor jog-trot
      fellows, and a complimentary motto or two is the utmost she can present to
      them. On the other hand, it is true she gives her first loves, those early
      birds, fully to understand that a change has come in their island mother&rsquo;s
      mind. If there is a balance to be righted, she leaves that business to
      society, and if it be the season for the gathering of society, it will be
      righted more or less; and if no righting is done at all, perhaps the Press
      will incidentally toss a leaf of laurel on a name or two: thus in the
      exercise of grumbling doing good.
    </p>
    <p>
      With few exceptions, Nevil Beauchamp&rsquo;s heroes received the motto instead
      of the sweetmeat. England expected them to do their duty; they did it, and
      she was not dissatisfied, nor should they be. Beauchamp, at a distance
      from the scene, chafed with customary vehemence, concerning the unjust
      measure dealt to his favourites: Captain Hardist, of the Diomed, twenty
      years a captain, still a captain! Young Michell denied the cross! Colonel
      Evans Cuff, on the heights from first to last, and not advanced a step!
      But Prancer, and Plunger, and Lammakin were thoroughly well taken care of,
      this critic of the war wrote savagely, reviving an echo of a queer small
      circumstance occurring in the midst of the high dolour and anxiety of the
      whole nation, and which a politic country preferred to forget, as we will
      do, for it was but an instance of strong family feeling in high quarters;
      and is not the unity of the country founded on the integrity of the family
      sentiment? Is it not certain, which the master tells us, that a line is
      but a continuation of a number of dots? Nevil Beauchamp was for insisting
      that great Government officers had paid more attention to a dot or two
      than to the line. He appeared to be at war with his country after the
      peace. So far he had a lively ally in his uncle Everard; but these remarks
      of his were a portion of a letter, whose chief burden was the request that
      Everard Romfrey would back him in proposing for the hand of a young French
      lady, she being, Beauchamp smoothly acknowledged, engaged to a wealthy
      French marquis, under the approbation of her family. Could mortal folly
      outstrip a petition of that sort? And apparently, according to the wording
      and emphasis of the letter, it was the mature age of the marquis which
      made Mr. Beauchamp so particularly desirous to stop the projected marriage
      and take the girl himself. He appealed to his uncle on the subject in a
      &lsquo;really&mdash;really&rsquo; remonstrative tone, quite overwhelming to read. &lsquo;It
      ought not to be permitted: by all the laws of chivalry, I should write to
      the girl&rsquo;s father to interdict it: I really am particeps criminis in a sin
      against nature if I don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; Mr. Romfrey interjected in burlesque of his
      ridiculous nephew, with collapsing laughter. But he expressed an indignant
      surprise at Nevil for allowing Rosamund to travel alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can take very good care of myself,&rsquo; Rosamund protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can do hundreds of things you should never be obliged to do while
      he&rsquo;s at hand, or I, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Romfrey. &lsquo;The fellow&rsquo;s insane. He
      forgets a gentleman&rsquo;s duty. Here&rsquo;s his &ldquo;humanity&rdquo; dogging a French frock,
      and pooh!&mdash;the age of the marquis! Fifty? A man&rsquo;s beginning his prime
      at fifty, or there never was much man in him. It&rsquo;s the mark of a fool to
      take everybody for a bigger fool than himself-or he wouldn&rsquo;t have written
      this letter to me. He can&rsquo;t come home yet, not yet, and he doesn&rsquo;t know
      when he can! Has he thrown up the service? I am to preserve the alliance
      between England and France by getting this French girl for him in the
      teeth of her marquis, at my peril if I refuse!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund asked, &lsquo;Will you let me see where Nevil says that, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Romfrey tore the letter to strips. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s one of your fellows who cock
      their eyes when they mean to be cunning. He sends you to do the wheedling,
      that&rsquo;s plain. I don&rsquo;t say he has hit on a bad advocate; but tell him I
      back him in no mortal marriage till he shows a pair of epaulettes on his
      shoulders. Tell him lieutenants are fledglings&mdash;he&rsquo;s not marriageable
      at present. It&rsquo;s a very pretty sacrifice of himself he intends for the
      sake of the alliance, tell him that, but a lieutenant&rsquo;s not quite big
      enough to establish it. You will know what to tell him, ma&rsquo;am. And say,
      it&rsquo;s the fellow&rsquo;s best friend that advises him to be out of it and home
      quick. If he makes one of a French trio, he&rsquo;s dished. He&rsquo;s too late for
      his luck in England. Have him out of that mire, we can&rsquo;t hope for more
      now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund postponed her mission to plead. Her heart was with Nevil; her
      understanding was easily led to side against him, and for better reasons
      than Mr. Romfrey could be aware of: so she was assured by her experience
      of the character of Mademoiselle de Croisnel. A certain belief in her
      personal arts of persuasion had stopped her from writing on her homeward
      journey to inform him that Nevil was not accompanying her, and when she
      drove over Steynham Common, triumphal arches and the odour of a roasting
      ox richly browning to celebrate the hero&rsquo;s return afflicted her mind with
      all the solid arguments of a common-sense country in contravention of a
      wild lover&rsquo;s vaporous extravagances. Why had he not come with her? The
      disappointed ox put the question in a wavering drop of the cheers of the
      villagers at the sight of the carriage without their bleeding hero. Mr.
      Romfrey, at his hall-doors, merely screwed his eyebrows; for it was the
      quality of this gentleman to foresee most human events, and his capacity
      to stifle astonishment when they trifled with his prognostics. Rosamund
      had left Nevil fast bound in the meshes of the young French sorceress, no
      longer leading, but submissively following, expecting blindly, seeing
      strange new virtues in the lurid indication of what appeared to border on
      the reverse. How could she plead for her infatuated darling to one who was
      common sense in person?
    </p>
    <p>
      Everard&rsquo;s pointed interrogations reduced her to speak defensively, instead
      of attacking and claiming his aid for the poor enamoured young man. She
      dared not say that Nevil continued to be absent because he was now
      encouraged by the girl to remain in attendance on her, and was more than
      half inspired to hope, and too artfully assisted to deceive the count and
      the marquis under the guise of simple friendship. Letters passed between
      them in books given into one another&rsquo;s hands with an audacious openness of
      the saddest augury for the future of the pair, and Nevil could be so lost
      to reason as to glory in Renee&rsquo;s intrepidity, which he justified by their
      mutual situation, and cherished for a proof that she was getting courage.
      In fine, Rosamund abandoned her task of pleading. Nevil&rsquo;s communications
      gave the case a worse and worse aspect: Renee was prepared to speak to her
      father; she delayed it; then the two were to part; they were unable to
      perform the terrible sacrifice and slay their last hope; and then Nevil
      wrote of destiny&mdash;language hitherto unknown to him, evidently the
      tongue of Renee. He slipped on from Italy to France. His uncle was
      besieged by a series of letters, and his cousin, Cecil Baskelett, a
      captain in England&rsquo;s grand reserve force&mdash;her Horse Guards, of the
      Blue division&mdash;helped Everard Romfrey to laugh over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not difficult, alack! Letters of a lover in an extremity of love,
      crying for help, are as curious to cool strong men as the contortions of
      the proved heterodox tied to a stake must have been to their chastening
      ecclesiastical judges. Why go to the fire when a recantation will save you
      from it? Why not break the excruciating faggot-bands, and escape, when you
      have only to decide to do it? We naturally ask why. Those martyrs of love
      or religion are madmen. Altogether, Nevil&rsquo;s adjurations and supplications,
      his threats of wrath and appeals to reason, were an odd mixture. &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t
      lose a chance while there&rsquo;s breath in his body,&rsquo; Everard said, quite
      good-humouredly, though he deplored that the chance for the fellow to make
      his hero-parade in society, and haply catch an heiress, was waning. There
      was an heiress at Steynham, on her way with her father to Italy, very
      anxious to see her old friend Nevil&mdash;Cecilia Halkett&mdash;and very
      inquisitive this young lady of sixteen was to know the cause of his
      absence. She heard of it from Cecil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And one morning last week mademoiselle was running away with him, and the
      next morning she was married to her marquis!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecil was able to tell her that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I used to be so fond of him,&rsquo; said the ingenuous young lady. She had to
      thank Nevil for a Circassian dress and pearls, which he had sent to her by
      the hands of Mrs. Culling&mdash;a pretty present to a girl in the nursery,
      she thought, and in fact she chose to be a little wounded by the cause of
      his absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a good creature-really,&rsquo; Cecil spoke on his cousin&rsquo;s behalf. &lsquo;Mad;
      he always will be mad. A dear old savage; always amuses me. He does! I get
      half my entertainment from him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Baskelett was gifted with the art, which is a fine and a precious
      one, of priceless value in society, and not wanting a benediction upon it
      in our elegant literature, namely, the art of stripping his fellow-man and
      so posturing him as to make every movement of the comical wretch
      puppet-like, constrained, stiff, and foolish. He could present you
      heroical actions in that fashion; for example:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A long-shanked trooper, bearing the name of John Thomas Drew, was
      crawling along under fire of the batteries. Out pops old Nevil, tries to
      get the man on his back. It won&rsquo;t do. Nevil insists that it&rsquo;s exactly one
      of the cases that ought to be, and they remain arguing about it like a
      pair of nine-pins while the Muscovites are at work with the bowls. Very
      well. Let me tell you my story. It&rsquo;s perfectly true, I give you my word.
      So Nevil tries to horse Drew, and Drew proposes to horse Nevil, as at
      school. Then Drew offers a compromise. He would much rather have crawled
      on, you know, and allowed the shot to pass over his head; but he&rsquo;s a
      Briton, old Nevil the same; but old Nevil&rsquo;s peculiarity is that, as you
      are aware, he hates a compromise&mdash;won&rsquo;t have it&mdash;retro Sathanas!
      and Drew&rsquo;s proposal to take his arm instead of being carried pickaback
      disgusts old Nevil. Still it won&rsquo;t do to stop where they are, like the
      cocoa-nut and the pincushion of our friends, the gipsies, on the downs: so
      they take arms and commence the journey home, resembling the best of
      friends on the evening of a holiday in our native clime&mdash;two steps to
      the right, half-a-dozen to the left, etcaetera.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, with scarce a variation from the facts, with but a flowery chaplet
      cast on a truthful narrative, as it were, Captain Baskelett could render
      ludicrous that which in other quarters had obtained honourable mention.
      Nevil and Drew being knocked down by the wind of a ball near the battery,
      &lsquo;Confound it!&rsquo; cries Nevil, jumping on his feet, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s because I consented
      to a compromise!&rsquo;&mdash;a transparent piece of fiction this, but so in
      harmony with the character stripped naked for us that it is accepted.
      Imagine Nevil&rsquo;s love-affair in such hands! Recovering from a fever, Nevil
      sees a pretty French girl in a gondola, and immediately thinks, &lsquo;By jingo,
      I&rsquo;m marriageable.&rsquo; He hears she is engaged. &lsquo;By jingo, she&rsquo;s marriageable
      too.&rsquo; He goes through a sum in addition, and the total is a couple; so he
      determines on a marriage. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t get it out of his head; he must be
      married instantly, and to her, because she is going to marry somebody
      else. Sticks to her, follows her, will have her, in spite of her father,
      her marquis, her brother, aunts, cousins, religion, country, and the young
      woman herself. I assure you, a perfect model of male fidelity! She is
      married. He is on her track. He knows his time will come; he has only to
      be handy. You see, old Nevil believes in Providence, is perfectly sure he
      will one day hear it cry out, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Beauchamp?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Here I am!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;And
      here&rsquo;s your marquise!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I knew I should have her at last,&rdquo; says
      Nevil, calm as Mont Blanc on a reduced scale.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The secret of Captain Baskelett&rsquo;s art would seem to be to show the
      automatic human creature at loggerheads with a necessity that winks at
      remarkable pretensions, while condemning it perpetually to doll-like
      action. You look on men from your own elevation as upon a quantity of our
      little wooden images, unto whom you affix puny characteristics, under
      restrictions from which they shall not escape, though they attempt it with
      the enterprising vigour of an extended leg, or a pair of raised arms, or a
      head awry, or a trick of jumping; and some of them are extraordinarily
      addicted to these feats; but for all they do the end is the same, for
      necessity rules, that exactly so, under stress of activity must the doll
      Nevil, the doll Everard, or the dolliest of dolls, fair woman, behave. The
      automatic creature is subject to the laws of its construction, you
      perceive. It can this, it can that, but it cannot leap out of its
      mechanism. One definition of the art is, humour made easy, and that may be
      why Cecil Baskelett indulged in it, and why it is popular with those whose
      humour consists of a readiness to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fun between Cecil Baskelett and Mr. Romfrey over the doll Nevil
      threatened an intimacy and community of sentiment that alarmed Rosamund on
      behalf of her darling&rsquo;s material prospects. She wrote to him, entreating
      him to come to Steynham. Nevil Beauchamp replied to her both frankly and
      shrewdly: &lsquo;I shall not pretend that I forgive my uncle Everard, and
      therefore it is best for me to keep away. Have no fear. The baron likes a
      man of his own tastes: they may laugh together, if it suits them; he never
      could be guilty of treachery, and to disinherit me would be that. If I
      were to become his open enemy to-morrow, I should look on the estates as
      mine-unless I did anything to make him disrespect me. You will not suppose
      it likely. I foresee I shall want money. As for Cecil, I give him as much
      rope as he cares to have. I know very well Everard Romfrey will see where
      the point of likeness between them stops. I apply for a ship the moment I
      land.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To test Nevil&rsquo;s judgement of his uncle, Rosamund ventured on showing this
      letter to Mr. Romfrey. He read it, and said nothing, but subsequently
      asked, from time to time, &lsquo;Has he got his ship yet?&rsquo; It assured her that
      Nevil was not wrong, and dispelled her notion of the vulgar imbroglio of a
      rich uncle and two thirsty nephews. She was hardly less relieved in
      reflecting that he could read men so soberly and accurately. The
      desperation of the youth in love had rendered her one little bit doubtful
      of the orderliness of his wits. After this she smiled on Cecil&rsquo;s
      assiduities. Nevil obtained his appointment to a ship bound for the coast
      of Africa to spy for slavers. He called on his uncle in London, and spent
      the greater part of the hour&rsquo;s visit with Rosamund; seemed cured of his
      passion, devoid of rancour, glad of the prospect of a run among the
      slaving hulls. He and his uncle shook hands manfully, at the full
      outstretch of their arms, in a way so like them, to Rosamund&rsquo;s thinking&mdash;that
      is, in a way so unlike any other possible couple of men so situated&mdash;that
      the humour of the sight eclipsed all the pleasantries of Captain
      Baskelett. &lsquo;Good-bye, sir,&rsquo; Nevil said heartily; and Everard Romfrey was
      not behind-hand with the cordial ring of his &lsquo;Good-bye, Nevil&rsquo;; and upon
      that they separated. Rosamund would have been willing to speak to her
      beloved of his false Renee&mdash;the Frenchwoman, she termed her, i.e.
      generically false, needless to name; and one question quivered on her
      tongue&rsquo;s tip: &lsquo;How, when she had promised to fly with you, how could she
      the very next day step to the altar with him now her husband?&rsquo; And, if she
      had spoken it, she would have added, &lsquo;Your uncle could not have set his
      face against you, had you brought her to England.&rsquo; She felt strongly the
      mastery Nevil Beauchamp could exercise even over his uncle Everard. But
      when he was gone, unquestioned, merely caressed, it came to her mind that
      he had all through insisted on his possession of this particular power,
      and she accused herself of having wantonly helped to ruin his hope&mdash;a
      matter to be rejoiced at in the abstract; but what suffering she had
      inflicted on him! To quiet her heart, she persuaded herself that for the
      future she would never fail to believe in him and second him blindly, as
      true love should; and contemplating one so brave, far-sighted, and
      self-assured, her determination seemed to impose the lightest of tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Practically humane though he was, and especially toward cattle and all
      kinds of beasts, Mr. Romfrey entertained no profound fellow-feeling for
      the negro, and, except as the representative of a certain amount of
      working power commonly requiring the whip to wind it up, he inclined to
      despise that black spot in the creation, with which our civilization
      should never have had anything to do. So he pronounced his mind, and the
      long habit of listening to oracles might grow us ears to hear and discover
      a meaning in it. Nevil&rsquo;s captures and releases of the grinning freights
      amused him for awhile. He compared them to strings of bananas, and
      presently put the vision of the whole business aside by talking of Nevil&rsquo;s
      banana-wreath. He desired to have Nevil out of it. He and Cecil handed
      Nevil in his banana-wreath about to their friends. Nevil, in his
      banana-wreath, was set preaching &lsquo;humanitomtity.&rsquo; At any rate, they
      contrived to keep the remembrance of Nevil Beauchamp alive during the
      period of his disappearance from the world, and in so doing they did him a
      service.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a pause between the descent of a diver and his return to the
      surface, when those who would not have him forgotten by the better world
      above him do rightly to relate anecdotes of him, if they can, and to
      provoke laughter at him. The encouragement of the humane sense of
      superiority over an object of interest, which laughter gives, is good for
      the object; and besides, if you begin to tell sly stories of one in the
      deeps who is holding his breath to fetch a pearl or two for you all, you
      divert a particular sympathetic oppression of the chest, that the
      extremely sensitive are apt to suffer from, and you dispose the larger
      number to keep in mind a person they no longer see. Otherwise it is likely
      that he will, very shortly after he has made his plunge, fatigue the
      contemplative brains above, and be shuffled off them, even as great ocean
      smoothes away the dear vanished man&rsquo;s immediate circle of foam, and
      rapidly confounds the rippling memory of him with its other agitations.
      And in such a case the apparition of his head upon our common level once
      more will almost certainly cause a disagreeable shock; nor is it
      improbable that his first natural snorts in his native element, though
      they be simply to obtain his share of the breath of life, will draw down
      on him condemnation for eccentric behaviour and unmannerly; and this in
      spite of the jewel he brings, unless it be an exceedingly splendid one.
      The reason is, that our brave world cannot pardon a breach of continuity
      for any petty bribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it chanced, owing to the prolonged efforts of Mr. Romfrey and Cecil
      Baskelett to get fun out of him, at the cost of considerable
      inventiveness, that the electoral Address of the candidate, signing
      himself &lsquo;R. C. S. Nevil Beauchamp,&rsquo; to the borough of Bevisham, did not
      issue from an altogether unremembered man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been cruising in the Mediterranean, commanding the Ariadne, the
      smartest corvette in the service. He had, it was widely made known, met
      his marquise in Palermo. It was presumed that he was dancing the round
      with her still, when this amazing Address appeared on Bevisham&rsquo;s walls, in
      anticipation of the general Election. The Address, moreover, was
      ultra-Radical: museums to be opened on Sundays; ominous references to the
      Land question, etc.; no smooth passing mention of Reform, such as the
      Liberal, become stately, adopts in speaking of that property of his, but
      swinging blows on the heads of many a denounced iniquity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecil forwarded the Address to Everard Romfrey without comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day the following letter, dated from Itchincope, the house of Mr.
      Grancey Lespel, on the borders of Bevisham, arrived at Steynham:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have despatched you the proclamation, folded neatly. The electors of
      Bevisham are summoned, like a town at the sword&rsquo;s point, to yield him
      their votes. Proclamation is the word. I am your born representative! I
      have completed my political education on salt water, and I tackle you on
      the Land question. I am the heir of your votes, gentlemen!&mdash;I forgot,
      and I apologize; he calls them fellow-men. Fraternal, and not so risky.
      Here at Lespel&rsquo;s we read the thing with shouts. It hangs in the
      smoking-room. We throw open the curacoa to the intelligence and industry
      of the assembled guests; we carry the right of the multitude to our host&rsquo;s
      cigars by a majority. C&rsquo;est un farceur que notre bon petit cousin. Lespel
      says it is sailorlike to do something of this sort after a cruise. Nevil&rsquo;s
      Radicalism would have been clever anywhere out of Bevisham. Of all
      boroughs! Grancey Lespel knows it. He and his family were Bevisham&rsquo;s Whig
      M.P.&lsquo;s before the day of Manchester. In Bevisham an election is an
      arrangement made by Providence to square the accounts of the voters, and
      settle arrears. They reckon up the health of their two members and the
      chances of an appeal to the country when they fix the rents and leases.
      You have them pointed out to you in the street, with their figures
      attached to them like titles. Mr. Tomkins, the twenty-pound man; an
      elector of uncommon purity. I saw the ruffian yesterday. He has an extra
      breadth to his hat. He has never been known to listen to a member under
      L20, and is respected enormously&mdash;like the lady of the Mythology, who
      was an intolerable Tartar of virtue, because her price was nothing less
      than a god, and money down. Nevil will have to come down on Bevisham in
      the Jupiter style. Bevisham is downright the dearest of boroughs&mdash;&ldquo;vaulting-boards,&rdquo;
       as Stukely Culbrett calls them&mdash;in the kingdom. I assume we still say
      &ldquo;kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He dashed into the Radical trap exactly two hours after landing. I
      believe he was on his way to the Halketts at Mount Laurels. A notorious
      old rascal revolutionist retired from his licenced business of slaughterer&mdash;one
      of your gratis doctors&mdash;met him on the high-road, and told him he was
      the man. Up went Nevil&rsquo;s enthusiasm like a bottle rid of the cork. You
      will see a great deal about faith in the proclamation; &ldquo;faith in the
      future,&rdquo; and &ldquo;my faith in you.&rdquo; When you become a Radical you have faith
      in any quantity, just as an alderman gets turtle soup. It is your badge,
      like a livery-servant&rsquo;s cockade or a corporal&rsquo;s sleeve stripes&mdash;your
      badge and your bellyful. Calculations were gone through at the Liberal
      newspaper-office, old Nevil adding up hard, and he was informed that he
      was elected by something like a topping eight or nine hundred and some
      fractions. I am sure that a fellow who can let himself be gulled by a pile
      of figures trumped up in a Radical newspaper-office must have great faith
      in the fractions. Out came Nevil&rsquo;s proclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not met him, and I would rather not. I shall not pretend to offer
      you advice, for I have the habit of thinking your judgement can stand by
      itself. We shall all find this affair a nuisance. Nevil will pay through
      the nose. We shall have the ridicule spattered on the family. It would be
      a safer thing for him to invest his money on the Turf, and I shall advise
      his doing it if I come across him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps the best course would be to telegraph for the marquise!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was from Cecil Baskelett. He added a postscript:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seriously, the &ldquo;mad commander&rdquo; has not an ace of a chance. Grancey and I
      saw some Working Men (you have to write them in capitals, king and queen
      small); they were reading the Address on a board carried by a red-nosed
      man, and shrugging. They are not such fools.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the way, I am informed Shrapnel has a young female relative living
      with him, said to be a sparkler. I bet you, sir, she is not a Radical. Do
      you take me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund Culling drove to the railway station on her way to Bevisham
      within an hour after Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s eyebrows had made acute play over this
      communication.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. AN INTERVIEW WITH THE INFAMOUS DR. SHRAPNEL
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the High street of the ancient and famous town and port of Bevisham,
      Rosamund met the military governor of a neighbouring fortress, General
      Sherwin, once colonel of her husband&rsquo;s regiment in India; and by him, as
      it happened, she was assisted in finding the whereabout of the young
      Liberal candidate, without the degrading recourse of an application at the
      newspaper-office of his party. The General was leisurely walking to a
      place of appointment to fetch his daughter home from a visit to an old
      school-friend, a Miss Jenny Denham, no other than a ward, or a niece, or
      an adoption of Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s: &lsquo;A nice girl; a great favourite of mine,&rsquo; 
      the General said. Shrapnel he knew by reputation only as a wrong-headed
      politician; but he spoke of Miss Denham pleasantly two or three times,
      praising her accomplishments and her winning manners. His hearer suspected
      that it might be done to dissociate the idea of her from the ruffling
      agitator. &lsquo;Is she pretty?&rsquo; was a question that sprang from Rosamund&rsquo;s
      intimate reflections. The answer was, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very pretty?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think very pretty,&rsquo; said the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Captivatingly?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clara thinks she is perfect; she is tall and slim, and dresses well. The
      girls were with a French Madam in Paris. But, if you are interested about
      her, you can come on with me, and we shall meet them somewhere near the
      head of the street. I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; the General hesitated and hummed&mdash;&lsquo;I
      don&rsquo;t call at Shrapnel&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have never heard her name before to-day,&rsquo; said Rosamund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly,&rsquo; said the General, crowing at the aimlessness of a woman&rsquo;s
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young ladies were seen approaching, and Rosamund had to ask herself
      whether the first sight of a person like Miss Denham would be of a kind to
      exercise a lively influence over the political and other sentiments of a
      dreamy sailor just released from ship-service. In an ordinary case she
      would have said no, for Nevil enjoyed a range of society where faces
      charming as Miss Denham&rsquo;s were plentiful as roses in the rose-garden. But,
      supposing him free of his bondage to the foreign woman, there was, she
      thought and feared, a possibility that a girl of this description might
      capture a young man&rsquo;s vacant heart sighing for a new mistress. And if so,
      further observation assured her Miss Denham was likely to be dangerous far
      more than professedly attractive persons, enchantresses and the rest.
      Rosamund watchfully gathered all the superficial indications which incite
      women to judge of character profoundly. This new object of alarm was, as
      the General had said of her, tall and slim, a friend of neatness, plainly
      dressed, but exquisitely fitted, in the manner of Frenchwomen. She spoke
      very readily, not too much, and had the rare gift of being able to speak
      fluently with a smile on the mouth. Vulgar archness imitates it. She won
      and retained the eyes of her hearer sympathetically, it seemed. Rosamund
      thought her as little conscious as a woman could be. She coloured at times
      quickly, but without confusion. When that name, the key of Rosamund&rsquo;s
      meditations, chanced to be mentioned, a flush swept over Miss Denham&rsquo;s
      face. The candour of it was unchanged as she gazed at Rosamund, with a
      look that asked, &lsquo;Do you know him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund said, &lsquo;I am an old friend of his.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is here now, in this town.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish to see him very much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      General Sherwin interposed: &lsquo;We won&rsquo;t talk about political characters just
      for the present.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish you knew him, papa, and would advise him,&rsquo; his daughter said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General nodded hastily. &lsquo;By-and-by, by-and-by.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They had in fact taken seats at a table of mutton pies in a pastrycook&rsquo;s
      shop, where dashing military men were restrained solely by their presence
      from a too noisy display of fascinations before the fashionable
      waiting-women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund looked at Miss Denham. As soon as they were in the street the
      latter said, &lsquo;If you will be good enough to come with me, madam...?&rsquo; 
      Rosamund bowed, thankful to have been comprehended. The two young ladies
      kissed cheeks and parted. General Sherwin raised his hat, and was
      astonished to see Mrs. Culling join Miss Denham in accepting the salute,
      for they had not been introduced, and what could they have in common? It
      was another of the oddities of female nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My name is Mrs. Culling, and I will tell you how it is that I am
      interested in Captain Beauchamp,&rsquo; Rosamund addressed her companion. &lsquo;I am
      his uncle&rsquo;s housekeeper. I have known him and loved him since he was a
      boy. I am in great fear that he is acting rashly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You honour me, madam, by speaking to me so frankly,&rsquo; Miss Denham
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is quite bent upon this Election?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, madam. I am not, as you can suppose, in his confidence, but I hear
      of him from Dr. Shrapnel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your uncle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I call him uncle: he is my guardian, madam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It is perhaps excuseable that this communication did not cause the doctor
      to shine with added lustre in Rosamund&rsquo;s thoughts, or ennoble the young
      lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not relatives, then?&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, unless love can make us so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not blood-relatives?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he not very... extreme?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is very sincere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I presume you are a politician?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Denham smiled. &lsquo;Could you pardon me, madam, if I said that I was?&rsquo; 
      The counter-question was a fair retort enfolding a gentler irony. Rosamund
      felt that she had to do with wits as well as with vivid feminine
      intuitions in the person of this Miss Denham.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said, &lsquo;I really am of opinion that our sex might abstain from
      politics.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We find it difficult to do justice to both parties,&rsquo; Miss Denham
      followed. &lsquo;It seems to be a kind of clanship with women; hardly even
      that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund was inattentive to the conversational slipshod, and launched one
      of the heavy affirmatives which are in dialogue full stops. She could not
      have said why she was sensible of anger, but the sentiment of anger, or
      spite (if that be a lesser degree of the same affliction), became stirred
      in her bosom when she listened to the ward of Dr. Shrapnel. A silly pretty
      puss of a girl would not have excited it, nor an avowed blood-relative of
      the demagogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevil&rsquo;s hotel was pointed out to Rosamund, and she left her card there. He
      had been absent since eight in the morning. There was the probability that
      he might be at Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s, so Rosamund walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Captain Beauchamp gives himself no rest,&rsquo; Miss Denham said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I know him, when once his mind is set on anything,&rsquo; said Rosamund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it not too early to begin to&mdash;canvass, I think, is the word?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is studying whatever the town can teach him of its wants; that is, how
      he may serve it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed! But if the town will not have him to serve it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He imagines that he cannot do better, until that has been decided, than
      to fit himself for the post.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Acting upon your advice? I mean, of course, your uncle&rsquo;s; that is, Dr.
      Shrapnel&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dr. Shrapnel thinks it will not be loss of time for Captain Beauchamp to
      grow familiar with the place, and observe as well as read.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It sounds almost as if Captain Beauchamp had submitted to be Dr.
      Shrapnel&rsquo;s pupil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is natural, madam, that Dr. Shrapnel should know more of political
      ways at present than Captain Beauchamp.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Captain Beauchamp&rsquo;s friends and relatives it appears very strange that
      he should have decided to contest this election so suddenly. May I inquire
      whether he and Dr. Shrapnel are old acquaintances?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, madam, they are not. They had never met before Captain Beauchamp
      landed, the other day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am surprised, I confess. I cannot understand the nature of an influence
      that induces him to abandon a profession he loves and shines in, for
      politics, at a moment&rsquo;s notice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Denham was silent, and then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will tell you, madam, how it occurred, as far as circumstances explain
      it. Dr. Shrapnel is accustomed to give a little country feast to the
      children I teach, and their parents if they choose to come, and they
      generally do. They are driven to Northeden Heath, where we set up a booth
      for them, and try with cakes and tea and games to make them spend one of
      their happy afternoons and evenings. We succeed, I know, for the little
      creatures talk of it and look forward to the day. When they are at their
      last romp, Dr. Shrapnel speaks to the parents.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can he obtain a hearing?&rsquo; Rosamund asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has not so very large a crowd to address, madam, and he is much
      beloved by those that come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He speaks to them of politics on those occasions?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Adouci a leur intention. It is not a political speech, but Dr. Shrapnel
      thinks, that in a so-called free country seeking to be really free, men of
      the lowest class should be educated in forming a political judgement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And women too?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And women, yes. Indeed, madam, we notice that the women listen very
      creditably.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They can put on the air.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid, not more than the men do. To get them to listen is
      something. They suffer like the men, and must depend on their intelligence
      to win their way out of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund&rsquo;s meditation was exclamatory: What can be the age of this
      pretentious girl?
    </p>
    <p>
      An afterthought turned her more conciliatorily toward the person, but less
      to the subject. She was sure that she was lending ear to the echo of the
      dangerous doctor, and rather pitied Miss Denham for awhile, reflecting
      that a young woman stuffed with such ideas would find it hard to get a
      husband. Mention of Nevil revived her feeling of hostility.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had seen a gentleman standing near and listening attentively,&rsquo; Miss
      Denham resumed, &lsquo;and when Dr. Shrapnel concluded a card was handed to him.
      He read it and gave it to me, and said, &ldquo;You know that name.&rdquo; It was a
      name we had often talked about during the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to Captain Beauchamp and shook his hand. He does not pay many
      compliments, and he does not like to receive them, but it was impossible
      for him not to be moved by Captain Beauchamp&rsquo;s warmth in thanking him for
      the words he had spoken. I saw that Dr. Shrapnel became interested in
      Captain Beauchamp the longer they conversed. We walked home together.
      Captain Beauchamp supped with us. I left them at half-past eleven at
      night, and in the morning I found them walking in the garden. They had not
      gone to bed at all. Captain Beauchamp has remained in Bevisham ever since.
      He soon came to the decision to be a candidate for the borough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund checked her lips from uttering: To be a puppet of Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s!
    </p>
    <p>
      She remarked, &lsquo;He is very eloquent&mdash;Dr. Shrapnel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Denham held some debate with herself upon the term.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps it is not eloquence; he often... no, he is not an orator.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund suggested that he was persuasive, possibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the young lady deliberately weighed the word, as though the nicest
      measure of her uncle or adoptor&rsquo;s quality in this or that direction were
      in requisition and of importance&mdash;an instance of a want of delicacy
      of perception Rosamund was not sorry to detect. For good-looking,
      refined-looking, quick-witted girls can be grown; but the nimble sense of
      fitness, ineffable lightning-footed tact, comes of race and breeding, and
      she was sure Nevil was a man soon to feel the absence of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dr. Shrapnel is persuasive to those who go partly with him, or whose
      condition of mind calls on him for great patience,&rsquo; Miss Denham said at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am only trying to comprehend how it was that he should so rapidly have
      won Captain Beauchamp to his views,&rsquo; Rosamund explained; and the young
      lady did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s house was about a mile beyond the town, on a common of
      thorn and gorse, through which the fir-bordered highway ran. A fence
      waist-high enclosed its plot of meadow and garden, so that the doctor,
      while protecting his own, might see and be seen of the world, as was the
      case when Rosamund approached. He was pacing at long slow strides along
      the gravel walk, with his head bent and bare, and his hands behind his
      back, accompanied by a gentleman who could be no other than Nevil,
      Rosamund presumed to think; but drawing nearer she found she was mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is not Captain Beauchamp&rsquo;s figure,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it is not he,&rsquo; said Miss Denham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund saw that her companion was pale. She warmed to her at once; by no
      means on account of the pallor in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have walked too fast for you, I fear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no; I am accused of being a fast walker.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund was unwilling to pass through the demagogue&rsquo;s gate. On second
      thoughts, she reflected that she could hardly stipulate to have news of
      Nevil tossed to her over the spikes, and she entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      While receiving Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s welcome to a friend of Captain Beauchamp,
      she observed the greeting between Miss Denham and the younger gentleman.
      It reassured her. They met like two that have a secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dreaded doctor was an immoderately tall man, lean and wiry, carelessly
      clad in a long loose coat of no colour, loose trowsers, and huge shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped from his height to speak, or rather swing the stiff upper half
      of his body down to his hearer&rsquo;s level and back again, like a ship&rsquo;s mast
      on a billowy sea. He was neither rough nor abrupt, nor did he roar
      bullmouthedly as demagogues are expected to do, though his voice was deep.
      He was actually, after his fashion, courteous, it could be said of him,
      except that his mind was too visibly possessed by distant matters for
      Rosamund&rsquo;s taste, she being accustomed to drawing-room and hunting and
      military gentlemen, who can be all in the words they utter. Nevertheless
      he came out of his lizard-like look with the down-dropped eyelids quick at
      a resumption of the dialogue; sometimes gesturing, sweeping his arm round.
      A stubborn tuft of iron-grey hair fell across his forehead, and it was
      apparently one of his life&rsquo;s labours to get it to lie amid the mass, for
      his hand rarely ceased to be in motion without an impulsive stroke at the
      refractory forelock. He peered through his eyelashes ordinarily, but from
      no infirmity of sight. The truth was, that the man&rsquo;s nature counteracted
      his spirit&rsquo;s intenser eagerness and restlessness by alternating a state of
      repose that resembled dormancy, and so preserved him. Rosamund was obliged
      to give him credit for straightforward eyes when they did look out and
      flash. Their filmy blue, half overflown with grey by age, was poignant
      while the fire in them lasted. Her antipathy attributed something
      electrical to the light they shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s account of Nevil stated him to have gone to call on Colonel
      Halkett, a new resident at Mount Laurels, on the Otley river. He offered
      the welcome of his house to the lady who was Captain Beauchamp&rsquo;s friend,
      saying, with extraordinary fatuity (so it sounded in Rosamund&rsquo;s ears),
      that Captain Beauchamp would certainly not let an evening pass without
      coming to him. Rosamund suggested that he might stay late at Mount
      Laurels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then he will arrive here after nightfall,&rsquo; said the doctor. &lsquo;A bed is at
      your service, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The offer was declined. &lsquo;I should like to have seen him to-day; but he
      will be home shortly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He will not quit Bevisham till this Election&rsquo;s decided unless to hunt a
      stray borough vote, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He goes to Mount Laurels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For that purpose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not think he will persuade Colonel Halkett to vote in the Radical
      interest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is the probability with a landed proprietor, ma&rsquo;am. We must knock,
      whether the door opens or not. Like,&rsquo; the doctor laughed to himself up
      aloft, &lsquo;like a watchman in the night to say that he smells smoke on the
      premises.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely we may expect Captain Beauchamp to consult his family about so
      serious a step as this he is taking,&rsquo; Rosamund said, with an effort to be
      civil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should he?&rsquo; asked the impending doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      His head continued in the interrogative position when it had resumed its
      elevation. The challenge for a definite reply to so outrageous a question
      irritated Rosamund&rsquo;s nerves, and, loth though she was to admit him to the
      subject, she could not forbear from saying, &lsquo;Why? Surely his family have
      the first claim on him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely not, ma&rsquo;am. There is no first claim. A man&rsquo;s wife and children
      have a claim on him for bread. A man&rsquo;s parents have a claim on him for
      obedience while he is a child. A man&rsquo;s uncles, aunts, and cousins have no
      claim on him at all, except for help in necessity, which he can grant and
      they require. None&mdash;wife, children, parents, relatives&mdash;none has
      a claim to bar his judgement and his actions. Sound the conscience, and
      sink the family! With a clear conscience, it is best to leave the family
      to its own debates. No man ever did brave work who held counsel with his
      family. The family view of a man&rsquo;s fit conduct is the weak point of the
      country. It is no other view than, &ldquo;Better thy condition for our sakes.&rdquo;
       Ha! In this way we breed sheep, fatten oxen: men are dying off. Resolution
      taken, consult the family means&mdash;waste your time! Those who go to it
      want an excuse for altering their minds. The family view is everlastingly
      the shopkeeper&rsquo;s! Purse, pence, ease, increase of worldly goods, personal
      importance&mdash;the pound, the English pound! Dare do that, and you
      forfeit your share of Port wine in this world; you won&rsquo;t be dubbed with a
      title; you&rsquo;ll be fingered at! Lord, Lord! is it the region inside a man,
      or out, that gives him peace? Out, they say; for they have lost faith in
      the existence of an inner. They haven&rsquo;t it. Air-sucker, blood-pump,
      cooking machinery, and a battery of trained instincts, aptitudes, fill up
      their vacuum. I repeat, ma&rsquo;am, why should young Captain Beauchamp spend an
      hour consulting his family? They won&rsquo;t approve him; he knows it. They may
      annoy him; and what is the gain of that? They can&rsquo;t move him; on that I
      let my right hand burn. So it would be useless on both sides. He thinks
      so. So do I. He is one of the men to serve his country on the best field
      we can choose for him. In a ship&rsquo;s cabin he is thrown away. Ay, ay, War,
      and he may go aboard. But now we must have him ashore. Too few of such as
      he!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is matter of opinion,&rsquo; said Rosamund, very tightly compressed;
      scarcely knowing what she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      How strange, besides hateful, it was to her to hear her darling spoken of
      by a stranger who not only pretended to appreciate but to possess him! A
      stranger, a man of evil, with monstrous ideas! A terribly strong
      inexhaustible man, of a magical power too; or would he otherwise have won
      such a mastery over Nevil?
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course she could have shot a rejoinder, to confute him with all the
      force of her indignation, save that the words were tumbling about in her
      head like a world in disruption, which made her feel a weakness at the
      same time that she gloated on her capacity, as though she had an enormous
      army, quite overwhelming if it could but be got to move in advance. This
      very common condition of the silent-stricken, unused in dialectics,
      heightened Rosamund&rsquo;s disgust by causing her to suppose that Nevil had
      been similarly silenced, in his case vanquished, captured, ruined; and he
      dwindled in her estimation for a moment or two. She felt that among a
      sisterhood of gossips she would soon have found her voice, and struck down
      the demagogue&rsquo;s audacious sophisms: not that they affected her in the
      slightest degree for her own sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shrapnel might think what he liked, and say what he liked, as far as she
      was concerned, apart from the man she loved. Rosamund went through these
      emotions altogether on Nevil&rsquo;s behalf, and longed for her affirmatizing
      inspiring sisterhood until the thought of them threw another shade on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      What champion was she to look to? To whom but to Mr. Everard Romfrey?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with a spasm of delighted reflection that she hit on Mr. Romfrey.
      He was like a discovery to her. With his strength and skill, his robust
      common sense and rough shrewd wit, his prompt comparisons, his chivalry,
      his love of combat, his old knightly blood, was not he a match, and an
      overmatch, for the ramping Radical who had tangled Nevil in his rough
      snares? She ran her mind over Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s virtues, down even to his
      towering height and breadth. Could she but once draw these two giants into
      collision in Nevil&rsquo;s presence, she was sure it would save him. The method
      of doing it she did not stop to consider: she enjoyed her triumph in the
      idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime she had passed from Dr. Shrapnel to Miss Denham, and carried on a
      conversation becomingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea had been made in the garden, and she had politely sipped half a cup,
      which involved no step inside the guilty house, and therefore no distress
      to her antagonism. The sun descended. She heard the doctor reciting. Could
      it be poetry? In her imagination the sombre hues surrounding an incendiary
      opposed that bright spirit. She listened, smiling incredulously. Miss
      Denham could interpret looks, and said, &lsquo;Dr. Shrapnel is very fond of
      those verses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund&rsquo;s astonishment caused her to say, &lsquo;Are they his own?&rsquo;&mdash;a
      piece of satiric innocency at which Miss Denham laughed softly as she
      answered, &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund pleaded that she had not heard them with any distinctness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are they written by the gentleman at his side?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Lydiard? No. He writes, but the verses are not his.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does he know&mdash;has he met Captain Beauchamp?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, once. Captain Beauchamp has taken a great liking to his works.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund closed her eyes, feeling that she was in a nest that had
      determined to appropriate Nevil. But at any rate there was the hope and
      the probability that this Mr. Lydiard of the pen had taken a long start of
      Nevil in the heart of Miss Denham: and struggling to be candid, to ensure
      some meditative satisfaction, Rosamund admitted to herself that the girl
      did not appear to be one of the wanton giddy-pated pusses who play two
      gentlemen or more on their line. Appearances, however, could be deceptive:
      never pretend to know a girl by her face, was one of Rosamund&rsquo;s maxims.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was next informed of Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s partiality for music toward the
      hour of sunset. Miss Denham mentioned it, and the doctor, presently
      sauntering up, invited Rosamund to a seat on a bench near the open window
      of the drawing-room. He nodded to his ward to go in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am a fire-worshipper, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;The God of day is the father of
      poetry, medicine, music: our best friend. See him there! My Jenny will
      spin a thread from us to him over the millions of miles, with one touch of
      the chords, as quick as he shoots a beam on us. Ay! on her wretched
      tinkler called a piano, which tries at the whole orchestra and murders
      every instrument in the attempt. But it&rsquo;s convenient, like our modern
      civilization&mdash;a taming and a diminishing of individuals for an
      insipid harmony!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You surely do not object to the organ?&mdash;I fear I cannot wait,
      though,&rsquo; said Rosamund.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Denham entreated her. &lsquo;Oh! do, madam. Not to hear me&mdash;I am not
      so perfect a player that I should wish it&mdash;but to see him. Captain
      Beauchamp may now be coming at any instant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lydiard added, &lsquo;I have an appointment with him here for this evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You build a cathedral of sound in the organ,&rsquo; said Dr. Shrapnel, casting
      out a league of leg as he sat beside his only half-persuaded fretful
      guest. &lsquo;You subject the winds to serve you; that&rsquo;s a gain. You do actually
      accomplish a resonant imitation of the various instruments; they sing out
      as your two hands command them&mdash;trumpet, flute, dulcimer, hautboy,
      drum, storm, earthquake, ethereal quire; you have them at your option. But
      tell me of an organ in the open air? The sublimity would vanish, ma&rsquo;am,
      both from the notes and from the structure, because accessories and
      circumstances produce its chief effects. Say that an organ is a despotism,
      just as your piano is the Constitutional bourgeois. Match them with the
      trained orchestral band of skilled individual performers, indoors or out,
      where each grasps his instrument, and each relies on his fellow with
      confidence, and an unrivalled concord comes of it. That is our republic
      each one to his work; all in union! There&rsquo;s the motto for us! Then you
      have music, harmony, the highest, fullest, finest! Educate your men to
      form a band, you shame dexterous trickery and imitation sounds. Then for
      the difference of real instruments from clever shams! Oh, ay, one will set
      your organ going; that is, one in front, with his couple of panting
      air-pumpers behind&mdash;his ministers!&rsquo; Dr. Shrapnel laughed at some
      undefined mental image, apparently careless of any laughing companionship.
      &lsquo;One will do it for you, especially if he&rsquo;s born to do it. Born!&rsquo; A slap
      of the knee reported what seemed to be an immensely contemptuous
      sentiment. &lsquo;But free mouths blowing into brass and wood, ma&rsquo;am, beat your
      bellows and your whifflers; your artificial choruses&mdash;crash, crash!
      your unanimous plebiscitums! Beat them? There&rsquo;s no contest: we&rsquo;re in
      another world; we&rsquo;re in the sun&rsquo;s world,&mdash;yonder!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Denham&rsquo;s opening notes on the despised piano put a curb on the
      doctor. She began a Mass of Mozart&rsquo;s, without the usual preliminary rattle
      of the keys, as of a crier announcing a performance, straight to her task,
      for which Rosamund thanked her, liking that kind of composed simplicity:
      she thanked her more for cutting short the doctor&rsquo;s fanatical nonsense. It
      was perceptible to her that a species of mad metaphor had been wriggling
      and tearing its passage through a thorn-bush in his discourse, with the
      furious urgency of a sheep in a panic; but where the ostensible subject
      ended and the metaphor commenced, and which was which at the conclusion,
      she found it difficult to discern&mdash;much as the sheep would, be when
      he had left his fleece behind him. She could now have said, &lsquo;Silly old
      man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Shrapnel appeared most placable. He was gazing at his Authority in the
      heavens, tangled among gold clouds and purple; his head bent acutely on
      one side, and his eyes upturned in dim speculation. His great feet planted
      on their heels faced him, suggesting the stocks; his arms hung loose. Full
      many a hero of the alehouse, anciently amenable to leg-and-foot
      imprisonment in the grip of the parish, has presented as respectable an
      air. His forelock straggled as it willed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund rose abruptly as soon as the terminating notes of the Mass had
      been struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Shrapnel seemed to be concluding his devotions before he followed her
      example.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, ma&rsquo;am, you have a telegraphic system for the soul,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;It
      is harder work to travel from this place to this&rsquo; (he pointed at ear and
      breast) &lsquo;than from here to yonder&rsquo; (a similar indication traversed the
      distance between earth and sun). &lsquo;Man&rsquo;s aim has hitherto been to keep men
      from having a soul for this world: he takes it for something infernal. He?&mdash;I
      mean, they that hold power. They shudder to think the conservatism of the
      earth will be shaken by a change; they dread they won&rsquo;t get men with souls
      to fetch and carry, dig, root, mine, for them. Right!&mdash;what then?
      Digging and mining will be done; so will harping and singing. But then we
      have a natural optimacy! Then, on the one hand, we whip the man-beast and
      the man-sloth; on the other, we seize that old fatted iniquity&mdash;that
      tyrant! that tempter! that legitimated swindler cursed of Christ! that
      palpable Satan whose name is Capital! by the neck, and have him disgorging
      within three gasps of his life. He is the villain! Let him live, for he
      too comes of blood and bone. He shall not grind the faces of the poor and
      helpless&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The comicality of her having such remarks addressed to her provoked a
      smile on Rosamund&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go at him like Samson blind,&rsquo; said Mr. Lydiard; and Miss Denham,
      who had returned, begged her guardian to entreat the guest to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said in an undertone, &lsquo;I am very anxious you should see Captain
      Beauchamp, madam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I too; but he will write, and I really can wait no longer,&rsquo; Rosamund
      replied, in extreme apprehension lest a certain degree of pressure should
      overbear her repugnance to the doctor&rsquo;s dinner-table. Miss Denham&rsquo;s look
      was fixed on her; but, whatever it might mean, Rosamund&rsquo;s endurance was at
      an end. She was invited to dine; she refused. She was exceedingly glad to
      find herself on the high-road again, with a prospect of reaching Steynham
      that night; for it was important that she should not have to confess a
      visit to Bevisham now when she had so little of favourable to tell Mr.
      Everard Romfrey of his chosen nephew. Whether she had acted quite wisely
      in not remaining to see Nevil, was an agitating question that had to be
      silenced by an appeal to her instincts of repulsion, and a further appeal
      for justification of them to her imaginary sisterhood of gossips. How
      could she sit and eat, how pass an evening in that house, in the society
      of that man? Her tuneful chorus cried, &lsquo;How indeed.&rsquo; Besides, it would
      have offended Mr. Romfrey to hear that she had done so. Still she could
      not refuse to remember Miss Denham&rsquo;s marked intimations of there being a
      reason for Nevil&rsquo;s friend to seize the chance of an immediate interview
      with him; and in her distress at the thought, Rosamund reluctantly, but as
      if compelled by necessity, ascribed the young lady&rsquo;s conduct to a strong
      sense of personal interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Evidently she has no desire he should run the risk of angering a rich
      uncle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This shameful suspicion was unavoidable: there was no other opiate for
      Rosamund&rsquo;s blame of herself after letting her instincts gain the
      ascendancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be found a common case, that when we have yielded to our
      instincts, and then have to soothe conscience, we must slaughter somebody,
      for a sacrificial offering to our sense of comfort.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. A SUPERFINE CONSCIENCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      However much Mr. Everard Romfrey may have laughed at Nevil Beauchamp with
      his &lsquo;banana-wreath,&rsquo; he liked the fellow for having volunteered for that
      African coast-service, and the news of his promotion by his admiral to the
      post of commander through a death vacancy, had given him an exalted
      satisfaction, for as he could always point to the cause of failures, he
      strongly appreciated success. The circumstance had offered an occasion for
      the new commander to hit him hard upon a matter of fact. Beauchamp had
      sent word of his advance in rank, but requested his uncle not to imagine
      him wearing an additional epaulette; and he corrected the infallible
      gentleman&rsquo;s error (which had of course been reported to him when he was
      dreaming of Renee, by Mrs. Culling) concerning a lieutenant&rsquo;s shoulder
      decorations, most gravely; informing him of the anchor on the lieutenant&rsquo;s
      pair of epaulettes, and the anchor and star on a commander&rsquo;s, and the
      crown on a captain&rsquo;s, with a well-feigned solicitousness to save his uncle
      from blundering further. This was done in the dry neat manner which Mr.
      Romfrey could feel to be his own turned on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to conceive a vague respect for the fellow who had proved him
      wrong upon a matter of fact. Beauchamp came from Africa rather worn by the
      climate, and immediately obtained the command of the Ariadne corvette,
      which had been some time in commission in the Mediterranean, whither he
      departed, without visiting Steynham; allowing Rosamund to think him
      tenacious of his wrath as well as of love. Mr. Romfrey considered him to
      be insatiable for service. Beauchamp, during his absence, had shown
      himself awake to the affairs of his country once only, in an urgent
      supplication he had forwarded for all his uncle&rsquo;s influence to be used to
      get him appointed to the first vacancy in Robert Hall&rsquo;s naval brigade,
      then forming a part of our handful in insurgent India. The fate of that
      chivalrous Englishman, that born sailor-warrior, that truest of heroes,
      imperishable in the memory of those who knew him, and in our annals, young
      though he was when death took him, had wrung from Nevil Beauchamp such a
      letter of tears as to make Mr. Romfrey believe the naval crown of glory
      his highest ambition. Who on earth could have guessed him to be bothering
      his head about politics all the while! Or was the whole stupid business a
      freak of the moment?
    </p>
    <p>
      It became necessary for Mr. Romfrey to contemplate his eccentric nephew in
      the light of a mannikin once more. Consequently he called to mind, and
      bade Rosamund Culling remember, that he had foreseen and had predicted the
      mounting of Nevil Beauchamp on his political horse one day or another; and
      perhaps the earlier the better. And a donkey could have sworn that when he
      did mount he would come galloping in among the Radical rough-riders.
      Letters were pouring upon Steynham from men and women of Romfrey blood and
      relationship concerning the positive tone of Radicalism in the commander&rsquo;s
      address. Everard laughed at them. As a practical man, his objection lay
      against the poor fool&rsquo;s choice of the peccant borough of Bevisham. Still,
      in view of the needfulness of his learning wisdom, and rapidly, the
      disbursement of a lot of his money, certain to be required by Bevisham&rsquo;s
      electors, seemed to be the surest method for quickening his wits. Thus
      would he be acting as his own chirurgeon, gaily practising phlebotomy on
      his person to cure him of his fever. Too much money was not the origin of
      the fever in Nevil&rsquo;s case, but he had too small a sense of the value of
      what he possessed, and the diminishing stock would be likely to cry out
      shrilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this effect, never complaining that Nevil Beauchamp had not come to him
      to take counsel with him, the high-minded old gentleman talked. At the
      same time, while indulging in so philosophical a picture of himself as was
      presented by a Romfrey mildly accounting for events and smoothing them
      under the infliction of an offence, he could not but feel that Nevil had
      challenged him: such was the reading of it; and he waited for some
      justifiable excitement to fetch him out of the magnanimous mood, rather in
      the image of an angler, it must be owned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil understands that I am not going to pay a farthing of his expenses
      in Bevisham?&rsquo; he said to Mrs. Culling.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied blandly and with innocence, &lsquo;I have not seen him, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. At the next mention of Nevil between them, he asked, &lsquo;Where is
      it he&rsquo;s lying perdu, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fancy in that town, in Bevisham.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At the Liberal, Radical, hotel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say; some place; I am not certain....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The rascal doctor&rsquo;s house there? Shrapnel&rsquo;s?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really... I have not seen him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you heard from him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have had a letter; a short one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where did he date his letter from?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From Bevisham.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From what house?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund glanced about for a way of escaping the question. There was none
      but the door. She replied, &lsquo;From Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the Anti-Game-Law agitator.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do not imagine, sir, that Nevil subscribes to every thing the horrid
      man agitates for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t like the man, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I detest him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! So you have seen Shrapnel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only for a moment; a moment or two. I cannot endure him. I am sure I have
      reason.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund flushed exceedingly red. The visit to Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s house was
      her secret, and the worming of it out made her feel guilty, and that
      feeling revived and heated her antipathy to the Radical doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What reason?&rsquo; said Mr. Romfrey, freshening at her display of colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not expose Nevil to the accusation of childishness by confessing
      her positive reason, so she answered, &lsquo;The man is a kind of man... I was
      not there long; I was glad to escape. He...&rsquo; she hesitated: for in truth
      it was difficult to shape the charge against him, and the effort to be
      reticent concerning Nevil, and communicative, now that he had been spoken
      of, as to the detested doctor, reduced her to some confusion. She was also
      fatally anxious to be in the extreme degree conscientious, and corrected
      and modified her remarks most suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did he insult you, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; Mr. Romfrey inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied hastily, &lsquo;Oh no. He may be a good man in his way. He is one of
      those men who do not seem to think a woman may have opinions. He does not
      scruple to outrage those we hold. I am afraid he is an infidel. His ideas
      of family duties and ties, and his manner of expressing himself, shocked
      me, that is all. He is absurd. I dare say there is no harm in him, except
      for those who are so unfortunate as to fall under his influence&mdash;and
      that, I feel sure, cannot be permanent. He could not injure me personally.
      He could not offend me, I mean. Indeed, I have nothing whatever to say
      against him, as far as I...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did he fail to treat you as a lady, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund was getting frightened by the significant pertinacity of her
      lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure, sir, he meant no harm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was the man uncivil to you, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; came the emphatic interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked herself, had Dr. Shrapnel been uncivil toward her? And so
      conscientious was she, that she allowed the question to be debated in her
      mind for half a minute, answering then, &lsquo;No, not uncivil. I cannot exactly
      explain.... He certainly did not intend to be uncivil. He is only an
      unpolished, vexatious man; enormously tall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Romfrey ejaculated, &lsquo;Ha! humph!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His view of Dr. Shrapnel was taken from that instant. It was, that this
      enormously big blustering agitator against the preservation of birds, had
      behaved rudely toward the lady officially the chief of his household, and
      might be considered in the light of an adversary one would like to meet.
      The size of the man increased his aspect of villany, which in return added
      largely to his giant size. Everard Romfrey&rsquo;s mental eye could perceive an
      attractiveness about the man little short of magnetic; for he thought of
      him so much that he had to think of what was due to his pacifical
      disposition (deeply believed in by him) to spare himself the trouble of a
      visit to Bevisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young gentleman whom he regarded as the Radical doctor&rsquo;s dupe, fell in
      for a share of his view of the doctor, and Mr. Romfrey became less fitted
      to observe Nevil Beauchamp&rsquo;s doings with the Olympian gravity he had
      originally assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extreme delicacy of Rosamund&rsquo;s conscience was fretted by a remorseful
      doubt of her having conveyed a just impression of Dr. Shrapnel, somewhat
      as though the fine sleek coat of it were brushed the wrong way. Reflection
      warned her that her deliberative intensely sincere pause before she
      responded to Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s last demand, might have implied more than her
      words. She consoled herself with the thought that it was the dainty
      susceptibility of her conscientiousness which caused these noble qualms,
      and so deeply does a refined nature esteem the gift, that her pride in it
      helped her to overlook her moral perturbation. She was consoled, moreover,
      up to the verge of triumph in her realization of the image of a rivalling
      and excelling power presented by Mr. Romfrey, though it had frightened her
      at the time. Let not Dr. Shrapnel come across him! She hoped he would not.
      Ultimately she could say to herself, &lsquo;Perhaps I need not have been so
      annoyed with the horrid man.&rsquo; It was on Nevil&rsquo;s account. Shrapnel&rsquo;s
      contempt of the claims of Nevil&rsquo;s family upon him was actually a piece of
      impudence, impudently expressed, if she remembered correctly. And Shrapnel
      was a black malignant, the foe of the nation&rsquo;s Constitution, deserving of
      punishment if ever man was; with his ridiculous metaphors, and talk of
      organs and pianos, orchestras and despotisms, and flying to the sun! How
      could Nevil listen to the creature! Shrapnel must be a shameless,
      hypocrite to mask his wickedness from one so clear-sighted as Nevil, and
      no doubt he indulged in his impudence out of wanton pleasure in it. His
      business was to catch young gentlemen of family, and to turn them against
      their families, plainly. That was thinking the best of him. No doubt he
      had his objects to gain. &lsquo;He might have been as impudent as he liked to
      me; I would have pardoned him!&rsquo; Rosamund exclaimed. Personally, you see,
      she was generous. On the whole, knowing Everard Romfrey as she did, she
      wished that she had behaved, albeit perfectly discreet in her behaviour,
      and conscientiously just, a shade or two differently. But the evil was
      done.

      CHAPTER XIV. THE LEADING ARTICLE AND MR. TIMOTHY TURBOT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nevil declined to come to Steynham, clearly owing to a dread of hearing
      Dr. Shrapnel abused, as Rosamund judged by the warmth of his written
      eulogies of the man, and an ensuing allusion to Game. He said that he had
      not made up his mind as to the Game Laws. Rosamund mentioned the fact to
      Mr. Romfrey. &lsquo;So we may stick by our licences to shoot to-morrow,&rsquo; he
      rejoined. Of a letter that he also had received from Nevil, he did not
      speak. She hinted at it, and he stared. He would have deemed it as vain a
      subject to discourse of India, or Continental affairs, at a period when
      his house was full for the opening day of sport, and the expectation of
      keeping up his renown for great bags on that day so entirely occupied his
      mind. Good shots were present who had contributed to the fame of Steynham
      on other opening days. Birds were plentiful and promised not to be too
      wild. He had the range of the Steynham estate in his eye, dotted with
      covers; and after Steynham, Holdesbury, which had never yielded him the
      same high celebrity, but both lay mapped out for action under the profound
      calculations of the strategist, ready to show the skill of the field
      tactician. He could not attend to Nevil. Even the talk of the forthcoming
      Elections, hardly to be avoided at his table, seemed a puerile
      distraction. Ware the foe of his partridges and pheasants, be it man or
      vermin! The name of Shrapnel was frequently on the tongue of Captain
      Baskelett. Rosamund heard him, in her room, and his derisive shouts of
      laughter over it. Cecil was a fine shot, quite as fond of the pastime as
      his uncle, and always in favour with him while sport stalked the land. He
      was in gallant spirits, and Rosamund, brooding over Nevil&rsquo;s fortunes, and
      sitting much alone, as she did when there were guests in the house, gave
      way to her previous apprehensions. She touched on them to Mr. Stukely
      Culbrett, her husband&rsquo;s old friend, one of those happy men who enjoy
      perceptions without opinions, and are not born to administer comfort to
      other than themselves. As far as she could gather, he fancied Nevil
      Beauchamp was in danger of something, but he delivered his mind only upon
      circumstances and characters: Nevil risked his luck, Cecil knew his game,
      Everard Romfrey was the staunchest of mankind: Stukely had nothing further
      to say regarding the situation. She asked him what he thought, and he
      smiled. Could a reasonable head venture to think anything in particular?
      He repeated the amazed, &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t say so&rsquo; of Colonel Halkett, on hearing
      the name of the new Liberal candidate for Bevisham at the dinner-table,
      together with some of Cecil&rsquo;s waggish embroidery upon the theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund exclaimed angrily, &lsquo;Oh! if I had been there he would not have
      dared.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not be there?&rsquo; said Stukely. &lsquo;You have had your choice for a number
      of years.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, reddening.
    </p>
    <p>
      But supposing that she had greater privileges than were hers now? The idea
      flashed. A taint of personal pique, awakened by the fancied necessity for
      putting her devotedness to Nevil to proof, asked her if she would then be
      the official housekeeper to whom Captain Baskelett bowed low with affected
      respect and impertinent affability, ironically praising her abroad as a
      wonder among women, that could at one time have played the deuce in the
      family, had she chosen to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just as you like,&rsquo; Mr. Culbrett remarked. It was his ironical habit of
      mind to believe that the wishes of men and women&mdash;women as well as
      men&mdash;were expressed by their utterances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But speak of Nevil to Colonel Halkett,&rsquo; said Rosamund, earnestly carrying
      on what was in her heart. &lsquo;Persuade the colonel you do not think Nevil
      foolish&mdash;not more than just a little impetuous. I want that marriage
      to come off! Not on account of her wealth. She is to inherit a Welsh mine
      from her uncle, you know, besides being an only child. Recall what Nevil
      was during the war. Miss Halkett has not forgotten it, I am sure, and a
      good word for him from a man of the world would, I am certain, counteract
      Captain Baskelett&rsquo;s&mdash;are they designs? At any rate, you can if you
      like help Nevil with the colonel. I am convinced they are doing him a
      mischief. Colonel Halkett has bought an estate&mdash;and what a misfortune
      that is!&mdash;close to Bevisham. I fancy he is Toryish. Will you not
      speak to him? At my request? I am so helpless I could cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fancy you have no handkerchief,&rsquo; said Mr. Culbrett, &lsquo;and give up
      scheming, pray. One has only to begin to scheme, to shorten life to
      half-a-dozen hops and jumps. I could say to the colonel, &ldquo;Young
      Beauchamp&rsquo;s a political cub: he ought to have a motherly wife.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, you are right; don&rsquo;t speak to him at all,&rsquo; said Rosamund,
      feeling that there must be a conspiracy to rob her of her proud
      independence, since not a soul could be won to spare her from taking some
      energetic step, if she would be useful to him she loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett was one of the guests at Steynham who knew and respected
      her, and he paid her a visit and alluded to Nevil&rsquo;s candidature,
      apparently not thinking much the worse of him. &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t allow him to
      succeed,&rsquo; he said, and looked for a smiling approval of such natural
      opposition, which Rosamund gave him readily after he had expressed the
      hope that Nevil Beauchamp would take advantage of his proximity to Mount
      Laurels during the contest to try the hospitality of the house. &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t
      mind meeting his uncle?&rsquo; The colonel&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. &lsquo;My daughter has
      engaged Mr. Romfrey and Captain Baskelett to come to us when they have
      shot Holdesbury.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Captain Baskelett! thought Rosamund; her jealousy whispering that the
      mention of his name close upon Cecilia Halkett&rsquo;s might have a nuptial
      signification.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a witness from her window&mdash;a prisoner&rsquo;s window, her &lsquo;eager
      heart could have termed it&mdash;of a remarkable ostentation of cordiality
      between the colonel and Cecil, in the presence of Mr. Romfrey. Was it his
      humour to conspire to hand Miss Halkett to Cecil, and then to show Nevil
      the prize he had forfeited by his folly? The three were on the lawn a
      little before Colonel Halkett&rsquo;s departure. The colonel&rsquo;s arm was linked
      with Cecil&rsquo;s while they conversed. Presently the latter received his
      afternoon&rsquo;s letters, and a newspaper. He soon had the paper out at a
      square stretch, and sprightly information for the other two was visible in
      his crowing throat. Mr. Romfrey raised the gun from his shoulder-pad, and
      grounded it. Colonel Halkett wished to peruse the matter with his own
      eyes, but Cecil could not permit it; he must read it aloud for them, and
      he suited his action to his sentences. Had Rosamund been accustomed to
      leading articles which are the composition of men of an imposing
      vocabulary, she would have recognized and as good as read one in Cecil&rsquo;s
      gestures as he tilted his lofty stature forward and back, marking his
      commas and semicolons with flapping of his elbows, and all but doubling
      his body at his periods. Mr. Romfrey had enough of it half-way down the
      column; his head went sharply to left and right. Cecil&rsquo;s peculiar foppish
      slicing down of his hand pictured him protesting that there was more and
      finer of the inimitable stuff to follow. The end of the scene exhibited
      the paper on the turf, and Colonel Halkett&rsquo;s hand on Cecil&rsquo;s shoulder, Mr.
      Romfrey nodding some sort of acquiescence over the muzzle of his gun,
      whether reflective or positive Rosamund could not decide. She sent out a
      footman for the paper, and was presently communing with its eloquent large
      type, quite unable to perceive where the comicality or the impropriety of
      it lay, for it would have struck her that never were truer things of Nevil
      Beauchamp better said in the tone befitting them. This perhaps was because
      she never heard fervid praises of him, or of anybody, delivered from the
      mouth, and it is not common to hear Englishmen phrasing great eulogies of
      one another. Still, as a rule, they do not object to have it performed in
      that region of our national eloquence, the Press, by an Irishman or a
      Scotchman. And what could there be to warrant Captain Baskelett&rsquo;s
      malicious derision, and Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s nodding assent to it, in an article
      where all was truth?
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was mounted on an unusually high wind. It was indeed a leading
      article of a banner-like bravery, and the unrolling of it was designed to
      stir emotions. Beauchamp was the theme. Nevil had it under his eyes
      earlier than Cecil. The paper was brought into his room with the beams of
      day, damp from the presses of the Bevisham Gazette, exactly opposite to
      him in the White Hart Hotel, and a glance at the paragraphs gave him a
      lively ardour to spring to his feet. What writing! He was uplifted as &lsquo;The
      heroical Commander Beauchamp, of the Royal Navy,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Commander
      Beauchamp, R.N., a gentleman of the highest connections&rsquo;: he was &lsquo;that
      illustrious Commander Beauchamp, of our matchless, navy, who proved on
      every field of the last glorious war of this country that the traditional
      valour of the noble and indomitable blood transmitted to his veins had
      lost none of its edge and weight since the battle-axes of the Lords de
      Romfrey, ever to the fore, clove the skulls of our national enemy on the
      wide and fertile campaigns of France.&rsquo; This was pageantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was more of it. Then the serious afflatus of the article
      condescended, as it were, to blow a shrill and well-known whistle:&mdash;the
      study of the science of navigation made by Commander Beauchamp, R.N., was
      cited for a jocose warranty of a seaman&rsquo;s aptness to assist in steering
      the Vessel of the State. After thus heeling over, to tip a familiar wink
      to the multitude, the leader tone resumed its fit deportment. Commander
      Beauchamp, in responding to the invitation of the great and united Liberal
      party of the borough of Bevisham, obeyed the inspirations of genius, the
      dictates of humanity, and what he rightly considered the paramount duty,
      as it is the proudest ambition, of the citizen of a free country.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for an occasional drop and bump of the sailing gasbag upon catch-words
      of enthusiasm, which are the rhetoric of the merely windy, and a collapse
      on a poetic line, which too often signalizes the rhetorician&rsquo;s emptiness
      of his wind, the article was eminent for flight, sweep, and dash, and
      sailed along far more grandly than ordinary provincial organs for the
      promoting or seconding of public opinion, that are as little to be
      compared with the mighty metropolitan as are the fife and bugle boys
      practising on their instruments round melancholy outskirts of garrison
      towns with the regimental marching full band under the presidency of its
      drum-major. No signature to the article was needed for Bevisham to know
      who had returned to the town to pen it. Those long-stretching sentences,
      comparable to the very ship Leviathan, spanning two Atlantic billows,
      appertained to none but the renowned Mr. Timothy Turbot, of the Corn Law
      campaigns, Reform agitations, and all manifestly popular movements
      requiring the heaven-endowed man of speech, an interpreter of multitudes,
      and a prompter. Like most men who have little to say, he was an orator in
      print, but that was a poor medium for him&mdash;his body without his fire.
      Mr. Timothy&rsquo;s place was the platform. A wise discernment, or else a lucky
      accident (for he came hurriedly from the soil of his native isle, needing
      occupation), set him on that side in politics which happened to be making
      an established current and strong headway. Oratory will not work against
      the stream, or on languid tides. Driblets of movements that allowed the
      world to doubt whether they were so much movements as illusions of the
      optics, did not suit his genius. Thus he was a Liberal, no Radical,
      fountain. Liberalism had the attraction for the orator of being the active
      force in politics, between two passive opposing bodies, the aspect of
      either of which it can assume for a menace to the other, Toryish as
      against Radicals; a trifle red in the eyes of the Tory. It can seem to
      lean back on the Past; it can seem to be amorous of the Future. It is
      actually the thing of the Present and its urgencies, therefore popular,
      pouring forth the pure waters of moderation, strong in their copiousness.
      Delicious and rapturous effects are to be produced in the flood of a
      Liberal oration by a chance infusion of the fierier spirit, a flavour of
      Radicalism. That is the thing to set an audience bounding and quirking.
      Whereas if you commence by tilling a Triton pitcher full of the neat
      liquor upon them, &lsquo;you have to resort to the natural element for the
      orator&rsquo;s art of variation, you are diluted&mdash;and that&rsquo;s bathos, to
      quote Mr. Timothy. It was a fine piece of discernment in him. Let
      Liberalism be your feast, Radicalism your spice. And now and then, off and
      on, for a change, for diversion, for a new emotion, just for half an hour
      or so-now and then the Sunday coat of Toryism will give you an air. You
      have only to complain of the fit, to release your shoulders in a trice.
      Mr. Timothy felt for his art as poets do for theirs, and considered what
      was best adapted to speaking, purely to speaking. Upon no creature did he
      look with such contempt as upon Dr. Shrapnel, whose loose disjunct
      audiences he was conscious he could, giving the doctor any start he liked,
      whirl away from him and have compact, enchained, at his first flourish;
      yea, though they were composed of &lsquo;the poor man,&rsquo; with a stomach for the
      political distillery fit to drain relishingly every private bogside or
      mountain-side tap in old Ireland in its best days&mdash;the illicit, you
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further, to quote Mr. Timothy&rsquo;s points of view, the Radical orator has but
      two notes, and one is the drawling pathetic, and the other is the
      ultra-furious; and the effect of the former we liken to the English
      working man&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s hob-set queasy brew of well-meant villany, that she
      calls by the innocent name of tea; and the latter is to be blown, asks to
      be blown, and never should be blown without at least seeming to be blown,
      with an accompaniment of a house on fire. Sir, we must adapt ourselves to
      our times. Perhaps a spark or two does lurk about our house, but we have
      vigilant watchmen in plenty, and the house has been pretty fairly insured.
      Shrieking in it is an annoyance to the inmates, nonsensical; weeping is a
      sickly business. The times are against Radicalism to the full as much as
      great oratory is opposed to extremes. These drag the orator too near to
      the matter. So it is that one Radical speech is amazingly like another&mdash;they
      all have the earth-spots. They smell, too; they smell of brimstone.
      Soaring is impossible among that faction; but this they can do, they can
      furnish the Tory his opportunity to soar. When hear you a thrilling Tory
      speech that carries the country with it, save when the incendiary Radical
      has shrieked? If there was envy in the soul of Timothy, it was addressed
      to the fine occasions offered to the Tory speaker for vindicating our
      ancient principles and our sacred homes. He admired the tone to be assumed
      for that purpose: it was a good note. Then could the Tory, delivering at
      the right season the Shakesperian &lsquo;This England...&rsquo; and Byronic&mdash;&lsquo;The
      inviolate Island...&rsquo; shake the frame, as though smiting it with the tail
      of the gymnotus electricus. Ah, and then could he thump out his Horace,
      the Tory&rsquo;s mentor and his cordial, with other great ancient comic and
      satiric poets, his old Port of the classical cellarage, reflecting
      veneration upon him who did but name them to an audience of good
      dispositions. The Tory possessed also an innate inimitably easy style of
      humour, that had the long reach, the jolly lordly indifference, the
      comfortable masterfulness, of the whip of a four-in-hand driver, capable
      of flicking and stinging, and of being ironically caressing. Timothy
      appreciated it, for he had winced under it. No professor of Liberalism
      could venture on it, unless it were in the remote district of a back
      parlour, in the society of a cherishing friend or two, and with a slice of
      lemon requiring to be refloated in the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      But gifts of this description were of a minor order. Liberalism gave the
      heading cry, devoid of which parties are dogs without a scent, orators
      mere pump-handles. The Tory&rsquo;s cry was but a whistle to his pack, the
      Radical howled to the moon like any chained hound. And no wonder, for
      these parties had no established current, they were as hard-bound waters;
      the Radical being dyked and dammed most soundly, the Tory resembling a
      placid lake of the plains, fed by springs and no confluents. For such good
      reasons, Mr. Timothy rejoiced in the happy circumstances which had
      expelled him from the shores of his native isle to find a refuge and a
      vocation in Manchester at a period when an orator happened to be in
      request because dozens were wanted. That centre of convulsions and source
      of streams possessed the statistical orator, the reasoning orator, and the
      inspired; with others of quality; and yet it had need of an ever-ready
      spontaneous imperturbable speaker, whose bubbling generalizations and
      ability to beat the drum humorous could swing halls of meeting from the
      grasp of an enemy, and then ascend on incalescent adjectives to the
      popular idea of the sublime. He was the artistic orator of Corn Law Repeal&mdash;the
      Manchester flood, before which time Whigs were, since which they have
      walked like spectral antediluvians, or floated as dead canine bodies that
      are sucked away on the ebb of tides and flung back on the flow, ignorant
      whether they be progressive or retrograde. Timothy Turbot assisted in that
      vast effort. It should have elevated him beyond the editorship of a
      country newspaper. Why it did not do so his antagonists pretended to know,
      and his friends would smile to hear. The report was that he worshipped the
      nymph Whisky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy&rsquo;s article had plucked Beauchamp out of bed; Beauchamp&rsquo;s card in
      return did the same for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Commander Beauchamp? I am heartily glad to make your acquaintance, sir;
      I&rsquo;ve been absent, at work, on the big business we have in common, I
      rejoice to say, and am behind my fellow townsmen in this pleasure and
      lucky I slept here in my room above, where I don&rsquo;t often sleep, for the
      row of the machinery&mdash;it &lsquo;s like a steamer that won&rsquo;t go, though it&rsquo;s
      always starting ye,&rsquo; Mr. Timothy said in a single breath, upon entering
      the back office of the Gazette, like unto those accomplished violinists
      who can hold on the bow to finger an incredible number of notes, and may
      be imaged as representing slow paternal Time, that rolls his capering
      dot-headed generation of mortals over the wheel, hundreds to the minute.
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse my not shaving, sir, to come down to your summons without
      an extra touch to the neck-band.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp beheld a middle-sized round man, with loose lips and pendant
      indigo jowl, whose eyes twinkled watery, like pebbles under the
      shore-wash, and whose neck-band needed an extra touch from fingers other
      than his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry to have disturbed you so early,&rsquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit, Commander Beauchamp, not a bit, sir. Early or late, and ay
      ready&mdash;with the Napiers; I&rsquo;ll wash, I&rsquo;ll wash.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I came to speak to you of this article of yours on me. They tell me in
      the office that you are the writer. Pray don&rsquo;t &ldquo;Commander&rdquo; me so much.&mdash;It&rsquo;s
      not customary, and I object to it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, certainly,&rsquo; Timothy acquiesced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And for the future, Mr. Turbot, please to be good enough not to allude in
      print to any of my performances here and there. Your intentions are
      complimentary, but it happens that I don&rsquo;t like a public patting on the
      back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, and that&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; said Timothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His appreciative and sympathetic agreement with these sharp strictures on
      the article brought Beauchamp to a stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy waited for him; then, smoothing his prickly cheek, remarked: &lsquo;If
      I&rsquo;d guessed your errand, Commander Beauchamp, I&rsquo;d have called in the
      barber before I came down, just to make myself decent for a &lsquo;first
      introduction.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp was not insensible to the slyness of the poke at him. &lsquo;You see,
      I come to the borough unknown to it, and as quietly as possible, and I
      want to be taken as a politician,&rsquo; he continued, for the sake of showing
      that he had sufficient to say to account for his hasty and peremptory
      summons of the writer of that article to his presence. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s excessively
      disagreeable to have one&rsquo;s family lugged into notice in a newspaper&mdash;especially
      if they are of different politics. I feel it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      All would, sir,&rsquo; said Timothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why the deuce did you do it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy drew a lading of air into his lungs. &lsquo;Politics, Commander
      Beauchamp, involves the doing of lots of disagreeable things to ourselves
      and our relations; it &lsquo;s positive. I&rsquo;m a soldier of the Great Campaign:
      and who knows it better than I, sir? It&rsquo;s climbing the greasy pole for the
      leg o&rsquo; mutton, that makes the mother&rsquo;s heart ache for the jacket and the
      nether garments she mended neatly, if she didn&rsquo;t make them. Mutton or no
      mutton, there&rsquo;s grease for certain! Since it&rsquo;s sure we can&rsquo;t be
      disconnected from the family, the trick is to turn the misfortune to a
      profit; and allow me the observation, that an old family, sir, and a high
      and titled family, is not to be despised for a background of a portrait in
      naval uniform, with medal and clasps, and some small smoke of powder
      clearing off over there:&mdash;that&rsquo;s if we&rsquo;re to act sagaciously in
      introducing an unknown candidate to a borough that has a sneaking liking
      for the kind of person, more honour to it. I&rsquo;m a political veteran, sir; I
      speak from experience. We must employ our weapons, every one of them, and
      all off the grindstone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Beauchamp. &lsquo;Now understand; you are not in future to
      employ the weapons, as you call them, that I have objected to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy gaped slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whatever you will, but no puffery,&rsquo; Beauchamp added. &lsquo;Can I by any means
      arrest&mdash;purchase&mdash;is it possible, tell me, to lay an embargo&mdash;stop
      to-day&rsquo;s issue of the Gazette?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No more&mdash;than the bite of a mad dog,&rsquo; Timothy replied, before he had
      considered upon the monstrous nature of the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp humphed, and tossed his head. The simile of the dog struck him
      with intense effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;d be a second edition,&rsquo; said Timothy, &lsquo;and you might buy up that.
      But there&rsquo;ll be a third, and you may buy up that; but there&rsquo;ll be a fourth
      and a fifth, and so on ad infinitum, with the advertisement of the sale of
      the foregoing creating a demand like a rageing thirst in a shipwreck, in
      Bligh&rsquo;s boat, in the tropics. I&rsquo;m afraid, Com&mdash;Captain Beauchamp,
      sir, there&rsquo;s no stopping the Press while the people have an appetite for
      it&mdash;and a Company&rsquo;s at the back of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pooh, don&rsquo;t talk to me in that way; all I complain of is the figure you
      have made of me,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, fetching him smartly out of his
      nonsense; &lsquo;and all I ask of you is not to be at it again. Who would
      suppose from reading an article like that, that I am a candidate with a
      single political idea!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An article like that,&rsquo; said Timothy, winking, and a little surer of his
      man now that he suggested his possession of ideas, &lsquo;an article like that
      is the best cloak you can put on a candidate with too many of &lsquo;em, Captain
      Beauchamp. I&rsquo;ll tell you, sir; I came, I heard of your candidature, I had
      your sketch, the pattern of ye, before me, and I was told that Dr.
      Shrapnel fathered you politically. There was my brief! I had to persuade
      our constituents that you, Commander Beauchamp of the Royal Navy, and the
      great family of the Earls of Romfrey, one of the heroes of the war, and
      the recipient of a Royal Humane Society&rsquo;s medal for saving life in
      Bevisham waters, were something more than the Radical doctor&rsquo;s political
      son; and, sir, it was to this end, aim, and object, that I wrote the
      article I am not ashamed to avow as mine, and I do so, sir, because of the
      solitary merit it has of serving your political interests as the liberal
      candidate for Bevisham by counteracting the unpopularity of Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s
      name, on the one part, and of reviving the credit due to your valour and
      high bearing on the field of battle in defence of your country, on the
      other, so that Bevisham may apprehend, in spite of party distinctions,
      that it has the option, and had better seize upon the honour, of making a
      M.P. of a hero.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp interposed hastily: &lsquo;Thank you, thank you for the best of
      intentions. But let me tell you I am prepared to stand or fall with Dr.
      Shrapnel, and be hanged to all that humbug.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy rubbed his hands with an abstracted air of washing. &lsquo;Well,
      commander, well, sir, they say a candidate&rsquo;s to be humoured in his
      infancy, for he has to do all the humouring before he&rsquo;s many weeks old at
      it; only there&rsquo;s the fact!&mdash;he soon finds out he has to pay for his
      first fling, like the son of a family sowing his oats to reap his Jews.
      Credit me, sir, I thought it prudent to counteract a bit of an
      apothecary&rsquo;s shop odour in the junior Liberal candidate&rsquo;s address. I found
      the town sniffing, they scented Shrapnel in the composition.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Every line of it was mine,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course it was, and the address was admirably worded, sir, I make bold
      to say it to your face; but most indubitably it threatened powerful drugs
      for weak stomachs, and it blew cold on votes, which are sensitive plants
      like nothing else in botany.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If they are only to be got by abandoning principles, and by anything but
      honesty in stating them, they may go,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I repeat, my dear sir, I repeat, the infant candidate delights in his
      honesty, like the babe in its nakedness, the beautiful virgin in her
      innocence. So he does; but he discovers it&rsquo;s time for him to wear clothes
      in a contested election. And what&rsquo;s that but to preserve the outlines
      pretty correctly, whilst he doesn&rsquo;t shock and horrify the optics? A dash
      of conventionalism makes the whole civilized world kin, ye know. That&rsquo;s
      the truth. You must appear to be one of them, for them to choose you.
      After all, there&rsquo;s no harm in a dyer&rsquo;s hand; and, sir, a candidate looking
      at his own, when he has won the Election...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, well,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, swinging on his heel, &lsquo;and now I&rsquo;ll take my
      leave of you, and I apologize for bringing you down here so early. Please
      attend to what I have said; it&rsquo;s peremptory. You will give me great
      pleasure by dining with me to-night, at the hotel opposite. Will you? I
      don&rsquo;t know what kind of wine I shall be able to offer you. Perhaps you
      know the cellar, and may help me in that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy grasped his hand, &lsquo;With pleasure, Commander Beauchamp. They have a
      bucellas over there that &lsquo;s old, and a tolerable claret, and a Port to be
      inquired for under the breath, in a mysteriously intimate tone of voice,
      as one says, &ldquo;I know of your treasure, and the corner under ground where
      it lies.&rdquo; Avoid the champagne: &lsquo;tis the banqueting wine. Ditto the sherry.
      One can drink them, one can drink them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At a quarter to eight this evening, then,&rsquo; said Nevil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be there at the stroke of the clock, sure as the date of a bill,&rsquo; 
      said Timothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it&rsquo;s early to guess whether you&rsquo;ll catch Bevisham or you won&rsquo;t, he
      reflected, as he gazed at the young gentleman crossing the road; but
      female Bevisham&rsquo;s with you, if that counts for much. Timothy confessed,
      that without the employment of any weapon save arrogance and a look of
      candour, the commander had gone some way toward catching the feminine side
      of himself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. CECILIA HALKETT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Beauchamp walked down to the pier, where he took a boat for H.M.S. Isis,
      to see Jack Wilmore, whom he had not met since his return from his last
      cruise, and first he tried the efficacy of a dive in salt water, as a
      specific for irritation. It gave the edge to a fine appetite that he
      continued to satisfy while Wilmore talked of those famous dogs to which
      the navy has ever been going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We want another panic, Beauchamp,&rsquo; said Lieutenant Wilmore. &lsquo;No one knows
      better than you what a naval man has to complain of, so I hope you&rsquo;ll get
      your Election, if only that we may reckon on a good look-out for the
      interests of the service. A regular Board with a permanent Lord High
      Admiral, and a regular vote of money to keep it up to the mark. Stick to
      that. Hardist has a vote in Bevisham. I think I can get one or two more.
      Why aren&rsquo;t you a Tory? No Whigs nor Liberals look after us half so well as
      the Tories. It&rsquo;s enough to break a man&rsquo;s heart to see the troops of
      dockyard workmen marching out as soon as ever a Liberal Government marches
      in. Then it&rsquo;s one of our infernal panics again, and patch here, patch
      there; every inch of it make-believe! I&rsquo;ll prove to you from examples that
      the humbug of Government causes exactly the same humbugging workmanship.
      It seems as if it were a game of &ldquo;rascals all.&rdquo; Let them sink us! but, by
      heaven! one can&rsquo;t help feeling for the country. And I do say it&rsquo;s the
      doing of those Liberals. Skilled workmen, mind you, not to be netted again
      so easily. America reaps the benefit of our folly .... That was a lucky
      run of yours up the Niger; the admiral was friendly, but you deserved your
      luck. For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t forget the state of our service when you&rsquo;re
      one of our cherubs up aloft, Beauchamp. This I&rsquo;ll say, I&rsquo;ve never heard a
      man talk about it as you used to in old midshipmite days, whole watches
      through&mdash;don&rsquo;t you remember? on the North American station, and in
      the Black Sea, and the Mediterranean. And that girl at Malta! I wonder
      what has become of her? What a beauty she was! I dare say she wasn&rsquo;t so
      fine a girl as the Armenian you unearthed on the Bosphorus, but she had
      something about her a fellow can&rsquo;t forget. That was a lovely creature
      coming down the hills over Granada on her mule. Ay, we&rsquo;ve seen handsome
      women, Nevil Beauchamp. But you always were lucky, invariably, and I
      should bet on you for the Election.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Canvass for me, Jack,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, smiling at his friend&rsquo;s
      unconscious double-skeining of subjects. &lsquo;If I turn out as good a
      politician as you are a seaman, I shall do. Pounce on Hardist&rsquo;s vote
      without losing a day. I would go to him, but I&rsquo;ve missed the Halketts
      twice. They &lsquo;re on the Otley river, at a place called Mount Laurels, and I
      particularly want to see the colonel. Can you give me a boat there, and
      come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said Wilmore. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve danced there with the lady, the
      handsomest girl, English style, of her time. And come, come, our English
      style&rsquo;s the best. It wears best, it looks best. Foreign women... they&rsquo;re
      capital to flirt with. But a girl like Cecilia Halkett&mdash;one can&rsquo;t
      call her a girl, and it won&rsquo;t do to say Goddess, and queen and charmer are
      out of the question, though she&rsquo;s both, and angel into the bargain; but,
      by George! what a woman to call wife, you say; and a man attached to a
      woman like that never can let himself look small. No such luck for me;
      only I swear if I stood between a good and a bad action, the thought of
      that girl would keep me straight, and I&rsquo;ve only danced with her once!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after sketching this rough presentation of the lady, with a
      masculine hand, Wilmore was able to point to her in person on the deck of
      her father&rsquo;s yacht, the Esperanza, standing out of Otley river. There was
      a gallant splendour in the vessel that threw a touch of glory on its
      mistress in the minds of the two young naval officers, as they pulled for
      her in the ship&rsquo;s gig.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilmore sang out, &lsquo;Give way, men!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailors bent to their oars, and presently the schooner&rsquo;s head was put
      to the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She sees we&rsquo;re giving chase,&rsquo; Wilmore said. &lsquo;She can&rsquo;t be expecting me,
      so it must be you. No, the colonel doesn&rsquo;t race her. They&rsquo;ve only been
      back from Italy six months: I mean the schooner. I remember she talked of
      you when I had her for a partner. Yes, now I mean Miss Halkett. Blest if I
      think she talked of anything else. She sees us. I&rsquo;ll tell you what she
      likes: she likes yachting, she likes Italy, she likes painting, likes
      things old English, awfully fond of heroes. I told her a tale of one of
      our men saving life. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t your friend Nevil Beauchamp
      save a man from drowning, off the guardship, in exactly the same place?&rdquo;
       And next day she sent me a cheque for three pounds for the fellow. Steady,
      men! I keep her letter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat went smoothly alongside the schooner. Miss Halkett had come to
      the side. The oars swung fore and aft, and Beauchamp sprang on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilmore had to decline Miss Halkett&rsquo;s invitation to him as well as his
      friend, and returned in his boat. He left the pair with a ruffling breeze,
      and a sky all sail, prepared, it seemed to him, to enjoy the most
      delicious you-and-I on salt water that a sailor could dream of; and
      placidly envying, devoid of jealousy, there was just enough of fancy
      quickened in Lieutenant Wilmore to give him pictures of them without
      disturbance of his feelings&mdash;one of the conditions of the singular
      visitation we call happiness, if he could have known it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time his visionary eye followed them pretty correctly. So long since
      they had parted last! such changes in the interval! and great animation in
      Beauchamp&rsquo;s gaze, and a blush on Miss Halkett&rsquo;s cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said once, &lsquo;Captain Beauchamp.&rsquo; He retorted with a solemn formality.
      They smiled, and immediately took footing on their previous intimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How good it was of you to come twice to Mount Laurels,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;I have
      not missed you to-day. No address was on your card. Where are you staying
      in the neighbourhood? At Mr. Lespel&rsquo;s?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m staying at a Bevisham hotel,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have not been to Steynham yet? Papa comes home from Steynham
      to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does he? Well, the Ariadne is only just paid off, and I can&rsquo;t well go to
      Steynham yet. I&mdash;&rsquo; Beauchamp was astonished at the hesitation he
      found in himself to name it: &lsquo;I have business in Bevisham.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Naval business?&rsquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sensitive prescience we have of a critical distaste of our proceedings
      is, the world is aware, keener than our intuition of contrary opinions;
      and for the sake of preserving the sweet outward forms of friendliness,
      Beauchamp was anxious not to speak of the business in Bevisham just then,
      but she looked and he had hesitated, so he said flatly, &lsquo;I am one of the
      candidates for the borough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I want the colonel to give me his vote.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady breathed a melodious &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; not condemnatory or reproachful&mdash;a
      sound to fill a pause. But she was beginning to reflect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Italy and our English Channel are my two Poles,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I am
      constantly swaying between them. I have told papa we will not lay up the
      yacht while the weather holds fair. Except for the absence of deep colour
      and bright colour, what can be more beautiful than these green waves and
      that dark forest&rsquo;s edge, and the garden of an island! The yachting-water
      here is an unrivalled lake; and if I miss colour, which I love, I remind
      myself that we have temperate air here, not a sun that fiends you under
      cover. We can have our fruits too, you see.&rsquo; One of the yachtsmen was
      handing her a basket of hot-house grapes, reclining beside crisp home-made
      loaflets. &lsquo;This is my luncheon. Will you share it, Nevil?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His Christian name was pleasant to hear from her lips. She held out a
      bunch to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grapes take one back to the South,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;How do you bear
      compliments? You have been in Italy some years, and it must be the South
      that has worked the miracle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In my growth?&rsquo; said Cecilia, smiling. &lsquo;I have grown out of my Circassian
      dress, Nevil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You received it, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wrote you a letter of thanks&mdash;and abuse, for your not coming to
      Steynham. You may recognize these pearls.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The pearls were round her right wrist. He looked at the blue veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re not pearls of price,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not wear them to fascinate the jewellers,&rsquo; rejoined Miss Halkett.
      &lsquo;So you are a candidate at an Election. You still have a tinge of Africa,
      do you know? But you have not abandoned the navy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;Not altogether.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! no, no: I hope not. I have heard of you,... but who has not? We
      cannot spare officers like you. Papa was delighted to hear of your
      promotion. Parliament!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The exclamation was contemptuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the highest we can aim at,&rsquo; Beauchamp observed meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I recollect you used to talk politics when you were a
      midshipman,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;You headed the aristocracy, did you not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The aristocracy wants a head,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Parliament, in my opinion, is the best of occupations for idle men,&rsquo; said
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It shows that it is a little too full of them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely the country can go on very well without so much speech-making?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It can go on very well for the rich.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Halkett tapped with her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should expect a Radical to talk in that way, Nevil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take me for one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would not even imagine it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say Liberal, then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you not&rsquo;&mdash;her eyes opened on him largely, and narrowed from
      surprise to reproach, and then to pain&mdash;are you not one of us? Have
      you gone over to the enemy, Nevil?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have taken my side, Cecilia; but we, on our side, don&rsquo;t talk of an
      enemy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most unfortunate! We are Tories, you know, Nevil. Papa is a thorough
      Tory. He cannot vote for you. Indeed I have heard him say he is anxious to
      defeat the plots of an old Republican in Bevisham&mdash;some doctor there;
      and I believe he went to London to look out for a second Tory candidate to
      oppose to the Liberals. Our present Member is quite safe, of course.
      Nevil, this makes me unhappy. Do you not feel that it is playing traitor
      to one&rsquo;s class to join those men?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the Tory way of thinking, Nevil Beauchamp said: the Tories upheld
      their Toryism in the place of patriotism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But do we not owe the grandeur of the country to the Tories?&rsquo; she said,
      with a lovely air of conviction. &lsquo;Papa has told me how false the Whigs
      played the Duke in the Peninsula: ruining his supplies, writing him down,
      declaring, all the time he was fighting his first hard battles, that his
      cause was hopeless&mdash;that resistance to Napoleon was impossible. The
      Duke never, never had loyal support but from the Tory Government. The
      Whigs, papa says, absolutely preached submission to Napoleon! The Whigs, I
      hear, were the Liberals of those days. The two Pitts were Tories. The
      greatness of England has been built up by the Tories. I do and will defend
      them: it is the fashion to decry them now. They have the honour and safety
      of the country at heart. They do not play disgracefully at reductions of
      taxes, as the Liberals do. They have given us all our heroes. Non fu mai
      gloria senza invidia. They have done service enough to despise the envious
      mob. They never condescend to supplicate brute force for aid to crush
      their opponents. You feel in all they do that the instincts of gentlemen
      are active.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do I speak too warmly?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;Papa and I have talked over it often,
      and especially of late. You will find him your delighted host and your
      inveterate opponent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just the same. You will have to pardon me; I am a terrible foe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I declare to you, Cecilia, I would prefer having you against me to having
      you indifferent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I had not to think it right that you should be beaten. And now&mdash;can
      you throw off political Nevil, and be sailor Nevil? I distinguish between
      my old friend, and my... our...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dreadful antagonist?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not so dreadful, except in the shock he gives us to find him in the
      opposite ranks. I am grieved. But we will finish our sail in peace. I
      detest controversy. I suppose, Nevil, you would have no such things as
      yachts? they are the enjoyments of the rich!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He reminded her that she wished to finish her sail in peace; and he had to
      remind her of it more than once. Her scattered resources for argumentation
      sprang up from various suggestions, such as the flight of yachts, mention
      of the shooting season, sight of a royal palace; and adopted a continually
      heightened satirical form, oddly intermixed with an undisguised
      affectionate friendliness. Apparently she thought it possible to worry him
      out of his adhesion to the wrong side in politics. She certainly had no
      conception of the nature of his political views, for one or two extreme
      propositions flung to him in jest, he swallowed with every sign of a
      perfect facility, as if the Radical had come to regard stupendous
      questions as morsels barely sufficient for his daily sustenance. Cecilia
      reflected that he must be playing, and as it was not a subject for play
      she tacitly reproved him by letting him be the last to speak of it. He may
      not have been susceptible to the delicate chastisement, probably was not,
      for when he ceased it was to look on the beauty of her lowered eyelids,
      rather with an idea that the weight of his argument lay on them. It
      breathed from him; both in the department of logic and of feeling, in his
      plea for the poor man and his exposition of the poor man&rsquo;s rightful
      claims, he evidently imagined that he had spoken overwhelmingly; and to
      undeceive him in this respect, for his own good, Cecilia calmly awaited
      the occasion when she might show the vanity of arguments in their effort
      to overcome convictions. He stood up to take his leave of her, on their
      return to the mouth of the Otley river, unexpectedly, so that the occasion
      did not arrive; but on his mentioning an engagement he had to give a
      dinner to a journalist and a tradesman of the town of Bevisham, by way of
      excuse for not complying with her gentle entreaty that he would go to
      Mount Laurels and wait to see the colonel that evening, &lsquo;Oh! then your
      choice must be made irrevocably, I am sure,&rsquo; Miss Halkett said, relying
      upon intonation and manner to convey a great deal more, and not without a
      minor touch of resentment for his having dragged her into the discussion
      of politics, which she considered as a slime wherein men hustled and
      tussled, no doubt worthily enough, and as became them; not however to
      impose the strife upon the elect ladies of earth. What gentleman ever did
      talk to a young lady upon the dreary topic seriously? Least of all should
      Nevil Beauchamp have done it. That object of her high imagination belonged
      to the exquisite sphere of the feminine vision of the pure poetic, and she
      was vexed by the discord he threw between her long-cherished dream and her
      unanticipated realization of him, if indeed it was he presenting himself
      to her in his own character, and not trifling, or not passing through a
      phase of young man&rsquo;s madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possibly he might be the victim of the latter and more pardonable state,
      and so thinking she gave him her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye, Nevil. I may tell papa to expect you tomorrow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do, and tell him to prepare for a field-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. &lsquo;A sham fight that will not win you a vote! I hope you will
      find your guests this evening agreeable companions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp half-shrugged involuntarily. He obliterated the piece of treason
      toward them by saying that he hoped so; as though the meeting them,
      instead of slipping on to Mount Laurels with her, were an enjoyable
      prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was dropped by the Esperanza&rsquo;s boat near Otley ferry, to walk along the
      beach to Bevisham, and he kept eye on the elegant vessel as she glided
      swan-like to her moorings off Mount Laurels park through dusky merchant
      craft, colliers, and trawlers, loosely shaking her towering snow-white
      sails, unchallenged in her scornful supremacy; an image of a refinement of
      beauty, and of a beautiful servicelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the yacht, so the mistress: things of wealth, owing their graces to
      wealth, devoting them to wealth&mdash;splendid achievements of art both!
      and dedicated to the gratification of the superior senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Say that they were precious examples of an accomplished civilization; and
      perhaps they did offer a visible ideal of grace for the rough world to aim
      at. They might in the abstract address a bit of a monition to the
      uncultivated, and encourage the soul to strive toward perfection, in
      beauty: and there is no contesting the value of beauty when the soul is
      taken into account. But were they not in too great a profusion in
      proportion to their utility? That was the question for Nevil Beauchamp.
      The democratic spirit inhabiting him, temporarily or permanently, asked
      whether they were not increasing to numbers which were oppressive? And
      further, whether it was good, for the country, the race, ay, the species,
      that they should be so distinctly removed from the thousands who fought
      the grand, and the grisly, old battle with nature for bread of life. Those
      grimy sails of the colliers and fishing-smacks, set them in a great sea,
      would have beauty for eyes and soul beyond that of elegance and
      refinement. And do but look on them thoughtfully, the poor are
      everlastingly, unrelievedly, in the abysses of the great sea....
    </p>
    <p>
      One cannot pursue to conclusions a line of meditation that is half-built
      on the sensations as well as on the mind. Did Beauchamp at all desire to
      have those idly lovely adornments of riches, the Yacht and the Lady, swept
      away? Oh, dear, no. He admired them, he was at home with them. They were
      much to his taste. Standing on a point of the beach for a last look at
      them before he set his face to the town, he prolonged the look in a manner
      to indicate that the place where business called him was not in comparison
      at all so pleasing: and just as little enjoyable were his meditations
      opposed to predilections. Beauty plucked the heart from his breast. But he
      had taken up arms; he had drunk of the questioning cup, that which denieth
      peace to us, and which projects us upon the missionary search of the How,
      the Wherefore, and the Why not, ever afterward. He questioned his
      justification, and yours, for gratifying tastes in an ill-regulated world
      of wrong-doing, suffering, sin, and bounties unrighteously dispensed&mdash;not
      sufficiently dispersed. He said by-and-by to pleasure, battle to-day. From
      his point of observation, and with the store of ideas and images his fiery
      yet reflective youth had gathered, he presented himself as it were saddled
      to that hard-riding force known as the logical impetus, which spying its
      quarry over precipices, across oceans and deserts, and through systems and
      webs, and into shops and cabinets of costliest china, will come at it,
      will not be refused, let the distances and the breakages be what they may.
      He went like the meteoric man with the mechanical legs in the song, too
      quick for a cry of protestation, and reached results amazing to his
      instincts, his tastes, and his training, not less rapidly and naturally
      than tremendous Ergo is shot forth from the clash of a syllogism.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. A PARTIAL DISPLAY OF BEAUCHAMP IN HIS COLOURS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Beauchamp presented himself at Mount Laurels next day, and formally asked
      Colonel Halkett for his vote, in the presence of Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took it for a playful glance at his new profession of politician: he
      spoke half-playfully. Was it possible to speak in earnest?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I &lsquo;m of the opposite party,&rsquo; said the colonel; as conclusive a reply as
      could be: but he at once fell upon the rotten navy of a Liberal
      Government. How could a true sailor think of joining those Liberals! The
      question referred to the country, not to a section of it, Beauchamp
      protested with impending emphasis: Tories and Liberals were much the same
      in regard to the care of the navy. &lsquo;Nevil!&rsquo; exclaimed Cecilia. He cited
      beneficial Liberal bills recently passed, which she accepted for a
      concession of the navy to the Tories, and she smiled. In spite of her
      dislike of politics, she had only to listen a few minutes to be drawn into
      the contest: and thus it is that one hot politician makes many among women
      and men of a people that have the genius of strife, or else in this case
      the young lady did unconsciously feel a deep interest in refuting and
      overcoming Nevil Beauchamp. Colonel Halkett denied the benefits of those
      bills. &lsquo;Look,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;at the scarecrow plight of the army under a
      Liberal Government!&rsquo; This laid him open to the charge that he was for
      backing Administrations instead of principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do,&rsquo; said the colonel. &lsquo;I would rather have a good Administration than
      all your talk of principles: one&rsquo;s a fact, but principles? principles?&rsquo; He
      languished for a phrase to describe the hazy things. &lsquo;I have mine, and you
      have yours. It&rsquo;s like a dispute between religions. There&rsquo;s no settling it
      except by main force. That&rsquo;s what principles lead you to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Principles may be hazy, but heavy artillery is disposable in defence of
      them, and Beauchamp fired some reverberating guns for the eternal against
      the transitory; with less of the gentlemanly fine taste, the light and
      easy social semi-irony, than Cecilia liked and would have expected from
      him. However, as to principles, no doubt Nevil was right, and Cecilia drew
      her father to another position. &lsquo;Are not we Tories to have principles as
      well as the Liberals, Nevil?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They may have what they call principles,&rsquo; he admitted, intent on pursuing
      his advantage over the colonel, who said, to shorten the controversy:
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a question of my vote, and my liking. I like a Tory Government, and
      I don&rsquo;t like the Liberals. I like gentlemen; I don&rsquo;t like a party that
      attacks everything, and beats up the mob for power, and repays it with
      sops, and is dragging us down from all we were proud of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the country is growing, the country wants expansion,&rsquo; said Beauchamp;
      &lsquo;and if your gentlemen by birth are not up to the mark, you must have
      leaders that are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leaders who cut down expenditure, to create a panic that doubles the
      outlay! I know them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A panic, Nevil.&rsquo; Cecilia threw stress on the memorable word.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would hear no reminder in it. The internal condition of the country was
      now the point for seriously-minded Englishmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear boy, what have you seen of the country?&rsquo; Colonel Halkett
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Every time I have landed, colonel, I have gone to the mining and the
      manufacturing districts, the centres of industry; wherever there was
      dissatisfaction. I have attended meetings, to see and hear for myself. I
      have read the papers....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The papers!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, they&rsquo;re the mirror of the country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does one see everything in a mirror, Nevil?&rsquo; said Cecilia: &lsquo;even in the
      smoothest?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He retorted softly: &lsquo;I should be glad to see what you see,&rsquo; and felled her
      with a blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an example of the mirror offered by the Press, Colonel Halkett touched
      on Mr. Timothy Turbot&rsquo;s article in eulogy of the great Commander
      Beauchamp. &lsquo;Did you like it?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;Ah, but if you meddle with
      politics, you must submit to be held up on the prongs of a fork, my boy;
      soaped by your backers and shaved by the foe; and there&rsquo;s a figure for a
      gentleman! as your uncle Romfrey says.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia did not join this discussion, though she had heard from her father
      that something grotesque had been written of Nevil. Her foolishness in
      blushing vexed body and mind. She was incensed by a silly compliment that
      struck at her feminine nature when her intellect stood in arms. Yet more
      hurt was she by the reflection that a too lively sensibility might have
      conjured up the idea of the compliment. And again, she wondered at herself
      for not resenting so rare a presumption as it implied, and not disdaining
      so outworn a form of flattery. She wondered at herself too for thinking of
      resentment and disdain in relation to the familiar commonplaces of
      licenced impertinence. Over all which hung a darkened image of her spirit
      of independence, like a moon in eclipse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where lay his weakness? Evidently in the belief that he had thought
      profoundly. But what minor item of insufficiency or feebleness was
      discernible? She discovered that he could be easily fretted by similes and
      metaphors they set him staggering and groping like an ancient knight of
      faery in a forest bewitched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your specific for the country is, then, Radicalism,&rsquo; she said, after
      listening to an attack on the Tories for their want of a policy and
      indifference to the union of classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would prescribe a course of it, Cecilia; yes,&rsquo; he turned to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Dr. Dulcamara of a single drug?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now you have a name for me! Tory arguments always come to epithets.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It should not be objectionable. Is it not honest to pretend to have only
      one cure for mortal maladies? There can hardly be two panaceas, can there
      be?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you call me quack?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Nevil, no,&rsquo; she breathed a rich contralto note of denial: &lsquo;but if the
      country is the patient, and you will have it swallow your prescription...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like a metaphor for an evasion,&rsquo; said Nevil, blinking
      over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew him another analogy, longer than was at all necessary; so tedious
      that her father struck through it with the remark:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Concerning that quack&mdash;that&rsquo;s one in the background, though!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know of none,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, well-advised enough to forbear mention
      of the name of Shrapnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia petitioned that her stumbling ignorance, which sought the road of
      wisdom, might be heard out. She had a reserve entanglement for her
      argumentative friend. &lsquo;You were saying, Nevil, that you were for
      principles rather than for individuals, and you instanced Mr. Cougham, the
      senior Liberal candidate of Bevisham, as one whom you would prefer to see
      in Parliament instead of Seymour Austin, though you confess to Mr.
      Austin&rsquo;s far superior merits as a politician and servant of his country:
      but Mr. Cougham supports Liberalism while Mr. Austin is a Tory. You are
      for the principle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am,&rsquo; said he, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked: &lsquo;Is not that equivalent to the doctrine of election by Grace?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp interjected: &lsquo;Grace! election?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was tender to his inability to follow her allusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou art a Liberal&mdash;then rise to membership,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Accept my
      creed, and thou art of the chosen. Yes, Nevil, you cannot escape from it.
      Papa, he preaches Calvinism in politics.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We stick to men, and good men,&rsquo; the colonel flourished. &lsquo;Old English for
      me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You might as well say, old timber vessels, when Iron&rsquo;s afloat, colonel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suspect you have the worst of it there, papa,&rsquo; said Cecilia, taken by
      the unexpectedness and smartness of the comparison coming from wits that
      she had been undervaluing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall not own I&rsquo;m worsted until I surrender my vote,&rsquo; the colonel
      rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t despair of it,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett bade him come for it as often as he liked. You&rsquo;ll be
      beaten in Bevisham, I warn you. Tory reckonings are safest: it&rsquo;s an
      admitted fact: and we know you can&rsquo;t win. According to my judgement a man
      owes a duty to his class.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A man owes a duty to his class as long as he sees his class doing its
      duty to the country,&rsquo; said Beauchamp; and he added, rather prettily in
      contrast with the sententious commencement, Cecilia thought, that the
      apathy of his class was proved when such as he deemed it an obligation on
      them to come forward and do what little they could. The deduction of the
      proof was not clearly consequent, but a meaning was expressed; and in that
      form it brought him nearer to her abstract idea of Nevil Beauchamp than
      when he raged and was precise.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his departure she talked of him with her father, to be charitably
      satirical over him, it seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The critic in her ear had pounced on his repetition of certain words that
      betrayed a dialectical stiffness and hinted a narrow vocabulary: his use
      of emphasis, rather reminding her of his uncle Everard, was, in a young
      man, a little distressing. &lsquo;The apathy of the country, papa; the apathy of
      the rich; a state of universal apathy. Will you inform me, papa, what the
      Tories are doing? Do we really give our consciences to the keeping of the
      parsons once a week, and let them dogmatize for us to save us from
      exertion? We must attach ourselves to principles; nothing is permanent but
      principles. Poor Nevil! And still I am sure you have, as I have, the
      feeling that one must respect him. I am quite convinced that he supposes
      he is doing his best to serve his country by trying for Parliament,
      fancying himself a Radical. I forgot to ask him whether he had visited his
      great-aunt, Mrs. Beauchamp. They say the dear old lady has influence with
      him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s been anywhere,&rsquo; Colonel Halkett half laughed at the
      quaint fellow. &lsquo;I wish the other great-nephew of hers were in England, for
      us to run him against Nevil Beauchamp. He&rsquo;s touring the world. I&rsquo;m told
      he&rsquo;s orthodox, and a tough debater. We have to take what we can get.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My best wishes for your success, and you and I will not talk of politics
      any more, papa. I hope Nevil will come often, for his own good; he will
      meet his own set of people here. And if he should dogmatize so much as to
      rouse our apathy to denounce his principles, we will remember that we are
      British, and can be sweet-blooded in opposition. Perhaps he may change,
      even tra le tre ore a le quattro: electioneering should be a lesson. From
      my recollection of Blackburn Tuckham, he was a boisterous boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He writes uncommonly clever letters home to his aunt Beauchamp. She has
      handed them to me to read,&rsquo; said the colonel. &lsquo;I do like to see tolerably
      solid young fellows: they give one some hope of the stability of the
      country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are not so interesting to study, and not half so amusing,&rsquo; said
      Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett muttered his objections to the sort of amusement furnished
      by firebrands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Firebrand is too strong a word for poor Nevil,&rsquo; she remonstrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that estimate of the character of Nevil Beauchamp, Cecilia soon had to
      confess that she had been deceived, though not by him.

      CHAPTER XVII. HIS FRIEND AND FOE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Looking from her window very early on a Sunday morning, Miss Halkett saw
      Beauchamp strolling across the grass of the park. She dressed hurriedly
      and went out to greet him, smiling and thanking him for his friendliness
      in coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said he was delighted, and appeared so, but dashed the sweetness. &lsquo;You
      know I can&rsquo;t canvass on Sundays!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose not,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;Have you walked up from Bevisham? You must
      be tired.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing tires me,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that they stepped on together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mount Laurels, a fair broad house backed by a wood of beeches and firs,
      lay open to view on the higher grassed knoll of a series of descending
      turfy mounds dotted with gorseclumps, and faced South-westerly along the
      run of the Otley river to the gleaming broad water and its opposite border
      of forest, beyond which the downs of the island threw long interlapping
      curves. Great ships passed on the line of the water to and fro; and a
      little mist of masts of the fishing and coasting craft by Otley village,
      near the river&rsquo;s mouth, was like a web in air. Cecilia led him to her
      dusky wood of firs, where she had raised a bower for a place of poetical
      contemplation and reading when the clear lapping salt river beneath her
      was at high tide. She could hail the Esperanza from that cover; she could
      step from her drawing-room window, over the flower-beds, down the gravel
      walk to the hard, and be on board her yacht within seven minutes, out on
      her salt-water lake within twenty, closing her wings in a French harbour
      by nightfall of a summer&rsquo;s day, whenever she had the whim to fly abroad.
      Of these enviable privileges she boasted with some happy pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the finest yachting-station in England,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      She expressed herself very glad that he should like it so much.
      Unfortunately she added, &lsquo;I hope you will find it pleasanter to be here
      than canvassing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no pleasure in canvassing,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I canvass poor men
      accustomed to be paid for their votes, and who get nothing from me but
      what the baron would call a parsonical exhortation. I&rsquo;m in the thick of
      the most spiritless crew in the kingdom. Our southern men will not compare
      with the men of the north. But still, even among these fellows, I see
      danger for the country if our commerce were to fail, if distress came on
      them. There&rsquo;s always danger in disunion. That&rsquo;s what the rich won&rsquo;t see.
      They see simply nothing out of their own circle; and they won&rsquo;t take a
      thought of the overpowering contrast between their luxury and the way of
      living, that&rsquo;s half-starving, of the poor. They understand it when fever
      comes up from back alleys and cottages, and then they join their efforts
      to sweep the poor out of the district. The poor are to get to their work
      anyhow, after a long morning&rsquo;s walk over the proscribed space; for we must
      have poor, you know. The wife of a parson I canvassed yesterday, said to
      me, &ldquo;Who is to work for us, if you do away with the poor, Captain
      Beauchamp?&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia quitted her bower and traversed the wood silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you would blow up my poor Mount Laurels for a peace-offering to the
      lower classes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should hope to put it on a stronger foundation, Cecilia.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By means of some convulsion?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By forestalling one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That must be one of the new ironclads,&rsquo; observed Cecilia, gazing at the
      black smoke-pennon of a tower that slipped along the water-line. &lsquo;Yes? You
      were saying? Put us on a stronger&mdash;&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s, I think, the Hastings: she broke down the other day on her trial
      trip,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, watching the ship&rsquo;s progress animatedly. &lsquo;Peppel
      commands her&mdash;a capital officer. I suppose we must have these costly
      big floating barracks. I don&rsquo;t like to hear of everything being done for
      the defensive. The defensive is perilous policy in war. It&rsquo;s true, the
      English don&rsquo;t wake up to their work under half a year. But, no: defending
      and looking to defences is bad for the fighting power; and there&rsquo;s half a
      million gone on that ship. Half a million! Do you know how many poor
      taxpayers it takes to make up that sum, Cecilia?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A great many,&rsquo; she slurred over them; &lsquo;but we must have big ships, and
      the best that are to be had.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Powerful fast rams, sea-worthy and fit for running over shallows,
      carrying one big gun; swarms of harryers and worriers known to be kept
      ready for immediate service; readiness for the offensive in case of war&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      the best defence against a declaration of war by a foreign State.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I like to hear you, Nevil,&rsquo; said Cecilia, beaming: &lsquo;Papa thinks we have a
      miserable army&mdash;in numbers. He says, the wealthier we become the more
      difficult it is to recruit able-bodied men on the volunteering system. Yet
      the wealthier we are the more an army is wanted, both to defend our wealth
      and to preserve order. I fancy he half inclines to compulsory enlistment.
      Do speak to him on that subject.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia must have been innocent of a design to awaken the fire-flash in
      Nevil&rsquo;s eyes. She had no design, but hostility was latent, and hence
      perhaps the offending phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded and spoke coolly. &lsquo;An army to preserve order? So, then, an army
      to threaten civil war!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To crush revolutionists.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Agitators, you mean. My dear good old colonel&mdash;I have always loved
      him&mdash;must not have more troops at his command.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you object to the drilling of the whole of the people?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does not the colonel, Cecilia? I am sure he does in his heart, and, for
      different reasons, I do. He won&rsquo;t trust the working-classes, nor I the
      middle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does Dr. Shrapnel hate the middle-class?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dr. Shrapnel cannot hate. He and I are of opinion, that as the
      middle-class are the party in power, they would not, if they knew the use
      of arms, move an inch farther in Reform, for they would no longer be in
      fear of the class below them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what horrible notions of your country have you, Nevil! It is dreadful
      to hear. Oh! do let us avoid politics for ever. Fear!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All concessions to the people have been won from fear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not heard so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will read it to you in the History of England.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You paint us in a condition of Revolution.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Happily it&rsquo;s not a condition unnatural to us. The danger would be in not
      letting it be progressive, and there&rsquo;s a little danger too at times in our
      slowness. We change our blood or we perish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dr. Shrapnel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I have heard Dr. Shrapnel say that. And, by-the-way, Cecilia&mdash;will
      you? can you?&mdash;take me for the witness to his character. He is the
      most guileless of men, and he&rsquo;s the most unguarded. My good Rosamund saw
      him. She is easily prejudiced when she is a trifle jealous, and you may
      hear from her that he rambles, talks wildly. It may seem so. I maintain
      there is wisdom in him when conventional minds would think him at his
      wildest. Believe me, he is the humanest, the best of men, tenderhearted as
      a child: the most benevolent, simple-minded, admirable old man&mdash;the
      man I am proudest to think of as an Englishman and a man living in my
      time, of all men existing. I can&rsquo;t overpraise him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has a bad reputation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only with the class that will not meet him and answer him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Must we invite him to our houses?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be difficult to get him to come, if you did. I mean, meet him in
      debate and answer his arguments. Try the question by brains.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Before mobs?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not before mobs. I punish you by answering you seriously.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sensible of the flattery.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Before mobs!&rsquo; Nevil ejaculated. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the Tories that mob together and
      cry down every man who appears to them to threaten their privileges. Can
      you guess what Dr. Shrapnel compares them to?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, Nevil, I have not an idea. I only wish your patriotism were large
      enough to embrace them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He compares them to geese claiming possession of the whole common, and
      hissing at every foot of ground they have to yield. They&rsquo;re always having
      to retire and always hissing. &ldquo;Retreat and menace,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s the motto for
      them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, Nevil, I am a goose upon a common.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Cecilia swam forward like a swan on water to give the morning
      kiss to her papa, by the open window of the breakfast-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never did bird of Michaelmas fling off water from her feathers more
      thoroughly than this fair young lady the false title she pretended to
      assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hear you&rsquo;re of the dinner party at Grancey Lespel&rsquo;s on Wednesday,&rsquo; the
      colonel said to Beauchamp. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have to stand fire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They will, papa,&rsquo; murmured Cecilia. &lsquo;Will Mr. Austin be there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I particularly wish to meet Mr. Austin,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen to him, if you do meet him,&rsquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      His look was rather grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lespel &lsquo;s a Whig,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel answered. &lsquo;Lespel was a Whig. Once a Tory always a Tory,&mdash;but
      court the people and you&rsquo;re on quicksands, and that&rsquo;s where the Whigs are.
      What he is now I don&rsquo;t think he knows himself. You won&rsquo;t get a vote.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia watched her friend Nevil recovering from his short fit of gloom.
      He dismissed politics at breakfast and grew companionable, with the charm
      of his earlier day. He was willing to accompany her to church too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will hear a long sermon,&rsquo; she warned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Forty minutes.&rsquo; Colonel Halkett smothered a yawn that was both retro and
      prospective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It has been fifty, papa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It has been an hour, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was good discipline nevertheless, the colonel affirmed, and Cecilia
      praised the Rev. Mr. Brisk of Urplesdon vicarage as one of our few
      remaining Protestant clergymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then he ought to be supported,&rsquo; said Beauchamp. &lsquo;In the dissensions of
      religious bodies it is wise to pat the weaker party on the back&mdash;I
      quote Stukely Culbrett.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I &lsquo;ve heard him,&rsquo; sighed the colonel. &lsquo;He calls the Protestant clergy the
      social police of the English middle-class. Those are the things he lets
      fly. I have heard that man say that the Church stands to show the passion
      of the human race for the drama. He said it in my presence. And there &lsquo;s a
      man who calls himself a Tory!
    </p>
    <p>
      You have rather too much of that playing at grudges and dislikes at
      Steynham, with squibs, nicknames, and jests at things that&mdash;well,
      that our stability is bound up in. I hate squibs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I,&rsquo; said Beauchamp. Some shadow of a frown crossed him; but Stukely
      Culbrett&rsquo;s humour seemed to be a refuge. &lsquo;Protestant parson-not clergy,&rsquo; 
      he corrected the colonel. &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you hear Mr. Culbrett, Cecilia? The
      Protestant parson is the policeman set to watch over the respectability of
      the middle-class. He has sharp eyes for the sins of the poor. As for the
      rich, they support his church; they listen to his sermon&mdash;to set an
      example: discipline, colonel. You discipline the tradesman, who&rsquo;s afraid
      of losing your custom, and the labourer, who might be deprived of his
      bread. But the people? It&rsquo;s put down to the wickedness of human nature
      that the parson has not got hold of the people. The parsons have lost them
      by senseless Conservatism, because they look to the Tories for the support
      of their Church, and let the religion run down the gutters. And how many
      thousands have you at work in the pulpit every Sunday? I&rsquo;m told the
      Dissenting ministers have some vitality.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett shrugged with disgust at the mention of Dissenters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And those thirty or forty thousand, colonel, call the men that do the
      work they ought to be doing demagogues. The parsonry are a power
      absolutely to be counted for waste, as to progress.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia perceived that her father was beginning to be fretted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said, with a tact that effected its object: &lsquo;I am one who hear Mr.
      Culbrett without admiring his wit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, and I see no good in this kind of Steynham talk,&rsquo; Colonel Halkett
      said, rising. &lsquo;We&rsquo;re none of us perfect. Heaven save us from political
      parsons!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp was heard to utter, &lsquo;Humanity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel left the room with Cecilia, muttering the Steynham tail to
      that word: &lsquo;tomtity,&rsquo; for the solace of an aside repartee.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was on her way to dress for church. He drew her into the library, and
      there threw open a vast placard lying on the table. It was printed in blue
      characters and red. &lsquo;This is what I got by the post this morning. I
      suppose Nevil knows about it. He wants tickling, but I don&rsquo;t like this
      kind of thing. It &lsquo;s not fair war. It &lsquo;s as bad as using explosive bullets
      in my old game.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can he expect his adversaries to be tender with him?&rsquo; Cecilia simulated
      vehemence in an underbreath. She glanced down the page:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;FRENCH MARQUEES&rsquo; caught her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a page of verse. And, oh! could it have issued from a Tory
      Committee?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Liberals are as bad, and worse,&rsquo; her father said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She became more and more distressed. &lsquo;It seems so very mean, papa; so
      base. Ungenerous is no word for it. And how vulgar! Now I remember, Nevil
      said he wished to see Mr. Austin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seymour Austin would not sanction it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, but Nevil might hold him responsible for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suspect Mr. Stukely Culbrett, whom he quotes, and that smoking-room lot
      at Lespel&rsquo;s. I distinctly discountenance it. So I shall tell them on
      Wednesday night. Can you keep a secret?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And after all Nevil Beauchamp is very young, papa!&mdash;of course I can
      keep a secret.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel exacted no word of honour, feeling quite sure of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He whispered the secret in six words, and her cheeks glowed vermilion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But they will meet on Wednesday after this,&rsquo; she said, and her sight went
      dancing down the column of verse, of which the following trotting couplet
      is a specimen:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;O did you ever, hot in love, a little British middy see,
   Like Orpheus asking what the deuce to do without Eurydice?&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      The middy is jilted by his FRENCH MARQUEES, whom he &lsquo;did adore,&rsquo; and in
      his wrath he recommends himself to the wealthy widow Bevisham, concerning
      whose choice of her suitors there is a doubt: but the middy is encouraged
      to persevere:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;Up, up, my pretty middy; take a draught of foaming Sillery;
   Go in and win the uriddy with your Radical artillery.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      And if Sillery will not do, he is advised, he being for superlatives, to
      try the sparkling Sillery of the Radical vintage, selected grapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was but impudent nonsense. But the reiterated apostrophe to &lsquo;MY
      FRENCH MARQUEES&rsquo; was considered by Cecilia to be a brutal offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was shocked that her party should have been guilty of it. Nevil
      certainly provoked, and he required, hard blows; and his uncle Everard
      might be right in telling her father that they were the best means of
      teaching him to come to his understanding. Still a foul and stupid squib
      did appear to her a debasing weapon to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot congratulate you on your choice of a second candidate, papa,&rsquo; 
      she said scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t much congratulate myself,&rsquo; said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a letter from Mrs. Beauchamp informing me that her boy Blackburn
      will be home in a month. There would have been plenty of time for him.
      However, we must make up our minds to it. Those two &lsquo;ll be meeting on
      Wednesday, so keep your secret. It will be out tomorrow week.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But Nevil will be accusing Mr. Austin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Austin won&rsquo;t be at Lespel&rsquo;s. And he must bear it, for the sake of peace.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Nevil ruined with his uncle, papa?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit, I should imagine. It&rsquo;s Romfrey&rsquo;s fun.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And this disgraceful squib is a part of the fun?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I know nothing about, my dear. I&rsquo;m sorry, but there&rsquo;s pitch and tar
      in politics as well as on shipboard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not see that there should be,&rsquo; said Cecilia resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t hope to have what should be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not? I would have it: I would do my utmost to have it,&rsquo; she flamed
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your utmost?&rsquo; Her father was glancing at her foregone mimicry of
      Beauchamp&rsquo;s occasional strokes of emphasis. &lsquo;Do your utmost to have your
      bonnet on in time for us to walk to church. I can&rsquo;t bear driving there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia went to her room with the curious reflection, awakened by what her
      father had chanced to suggest to her mind, that she likewise could be
      fervid, positive, uncompromising&mdash;who knows? Radicalish, perhaps,
      when she looked eye to eye on an evil. For a moment or so she espied
      within herself a gulf of possibilities, wherein black night-birds, known
      as queries, roused by shot of light, do flap their wings.&mdash;Her utmost
      to have be what should be! And why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      But the intemperate feeling subsided while she was doing duty before her
      mirror, and the visionary gulf closed immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had merely been very angry on Nevil Beauchamp&rsquo;s behalf, and had dimly
      seen that a woman can feel insurgent, almost revolutionary, for a personal
      cause, Tory though her instinct of safety and love of smoothness make her.
    </p>
    <p>
      No reflection upon this casual piece of self or sex revelation troubled
      her head. She did, however, think of her position as the friend of Nevil
      in utter antagonism to him. It beset her with contradictions that blew
      rough on her cherished serenity; for she was of the order of ladies who,
      by virtue of their pride and spirit, their port and their beauty, decree
      unto themselves the rank of princesses among women, before our world has
      tried their claim to it. She had lived hitherto in upper air, high above
      the clouds of earth. Her ideal of a man was of one similarly disengaged
      and lofty-loftier. Nevil, she could honestly say, was not her ideal; he
      was only her old friend, and she was opposed to him in his present
      adventure. The striking at him to cure him of his mental errors and
      excesses was an obligation; she could descend upon him calmly with the
      chastening rod, pointing to the better way; but the shielding of him was a
      different thing; it dragged her down so low, that in her condemnation of
      the Tory squib she found herself asking herself whether haply Nevil had
      flung off the yoke of the French lady; with the foolish excuse for the
      question, that if he had not, he must be bitterly sensitive to the
      slightest public allusion to her. Had he? And if not, how desperately
      faithful he was! or else how marvellously seductive she!
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was a lover&rsquo;s despair that had precipitated him into the mire
      of politics. She conceived the impression that it must be so, and
      throughout the day she had an inexplicable unsweet pleasure in inciting
      him to argumentation and combating him, though she was compelled to admit
      that he had been colloquially charming antecedent to her naughty
      provocation; and though she was indebted to him for his patient decorum
      under the weary wave of the Reverend Mr. Brisk. Now what does it matter
      what a woman thinks in politics? But he deemed it of great moment.
      Politically, he deemed that women have souls, a certain fire of life for
      exercise on earth. He appealed to reason in them; he would not hear of
      convictions. He quoted the Bevisham doctor!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Convictions are generally first impressions that are sealed with later
      prejudices,&rsquo; and insisted there was wisdom in it. Nothing tired him, as he
      had said, and addressing woman or man, no prospect of fatigue or of
      hopeless effort daunted him in the endeavour to correct an error of
      judgement in politics&mdash;his notion of an error. The value he put upon
      speaking, urging his views, was really fanatical. It appeared that he
      canvassed the borough from early morning till near midnight, and nothing
      would persuade him that his chance was poor; nothing that an entrenched
      Tory like her father, was not to be won even by an assault of all the
      reserve forces of Radical pathos, prognostication, and statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only conceive Nevil Beauchamp knocking at doors late at night, the sturdy
      beggar of a vote! or waylaying workmen, as he confessed without shame that
      he had done, on their way trooping to their midday meal; penetrating
      malodoriferous rooms of dismal ten-pound cottagers, to exhort bedraggled
      mothers and babes, and besotted husbands; and exposed to rebuffs from
      impertinent tradesmen; and lampooned and travestied, shouting speeches to
      roaring men, pushed from shoulder to shoulder of the mob!...
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia dropped a curtain on her mind&rsquo;s picture of him. But the blinding
      curtain rekindled the thought that the line he had taken could not but be
      the desperation of a lover abandoned. She feared it was, she feared it was
      not. Nevil Beauchamp&rsquo;s foe persisted in fearing that it was not; his
      friend feared that it was. Yet why? For if it was, then he could not be
      quite in earnest, and might be cured. Nay, but earnestness works out its
      own cure more surely than frenzy, and it should be preferable to think him
      sound of heart, sincere though mistaken. Cecilia could not decide upon
      what she dared wish for his health&rsquo;s good. Friend and foe were not further
      separable within her bosom than one tick from another of a clock; they
      changed places, and next his friend was fearing what his foe had feared:
      they were inextricable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why had he not sprung up on a radiant aquiline ambition, whither one might
      have followed him, with eyes and prayers for him, if it was not possible
      to do so companionably? At present, in the shape of a canvassing
      candidate, it was hardly honourable to let imagination dwell on him, save
      compassionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he rose to take his leave, Cecilia said, &lsquo;Must you go to Itchincope
      on Wednesday, Nevil?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett added: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I would go to Lespel&rsquo;s if I were
      you. I rather suspect Seymour Austin will be coming on Wednesday, and that
      &lsquo;ll detain me here, and you might join us and lend him an ear for an
      evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have particular reasons for going to Lespel&rsquo;s; I hear he wavers toward
      a Tory conspiracy of some sort,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel held his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The untiring young candidate chose to walk down to Bevisham at eleven
      o&rsquo;clock at night, that he might be the readier to continue his canvass of
      the borough on Monday morning early. He was offered a bed or a conveyance,
      and he declined both; the dog-cart he declined out of consideration for
      horse and groom, which an owner of stables could not but approve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett broke into exclamations of pity for so good a young fellow
      so misguided.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was moonless, and Cecilia, looking through the window, said
      whimsically, &lsquo;He has gone out into the darkness, and is no light in it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly none shone. She however carried a lamp that revealed him footing
      on with a wonderful air of confidence, and she was rather surprised to
      hear her father regret that Nevil Beauchamp should be losing his good
      looks already, owing to that miserable business of his in Bevisham. She
      would have thought the contrary, that he was looking as well as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He dresses just as he used to dress,&rsquo; she observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The individual style of a naval officer of breeding, in which you see
      neatness trifling with disorder, or disorder plucking at neatness, like
      the breeze a trim vessel, had been caught to perfection by Nevil
      Beauchamp, according to Cecilia. It presented him to her mind in a
      cheerful and a very undemocratic aspect, but in realizing it, the thought,
      like something flashing black, crossed her&mdash;how attractive such a
      style must be to a Frenchwoman!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He may look a little worn,&rsquo; she acquiesced.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. CONCERNING THE ACT OF CANVASSING
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tories dread the restlessness of Radicals, and Radicals are in awe of the
      organization of Tories. Beauchamp thought anxiously of the high degree of
      confidence existing in the Tory camp, whose chief could afford to keep
      aloof, while he slaved all day and half the night to thump ideas into
      heads, like a cooper on a cask:&mdash;an impassioned cooper on an empty
      cask! if such an image is presentable. Even so enviously sometimes the
      writer and the barrister, men dependent on their active wits, regard the
      man with a business fixed in an office managed by clerks. That man seems
      by comparison celestially seated. But he has his fits of trepidation; for
      new tastes prevail and new habits are formed, and the structure of his
      business will not allow him to adapt himself to them in a minute. The
      secure and comfortable have to pay in occasional panics for the serenity
      they enjoy. Mr. Seymour Austin candidly avowed to Colonel Halkett, on his
      arrival at Mount Laurels, that he was advised to take up his quarters in
      the neighbourhood of Bevisham by a recent report of his committee,
      describing the young Radical&rsquo;s canvass as redoubtable. Cougham he did not
      fear: he could make a sort of calculation of the votes for the Liberal
      thumping on the old drum of Reform; but the number for him who appealed to
      feelings and quickened the romantic sentiments of the common people now
      huddled within our electoral penfold, was not calculable. Tory and Radical
      have an eye for one another, which overlooks the Liberal at all times
      except when he is, as they imagine, playing the game of either of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now we shall see the passions worked,&rsquo; Mr. Austin said, deploring the
      extension of the franchise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked whether Beauchamp spoke well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia left it to her father to reply; but the colonel appealed to her,
      saying, &lsquo;Inclined to dragoon one, isn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not think that. &lsquo;He speaks... he speaks well in conversation. I
      fancy he would be liked by the poor. I should doubt his being a good
      public speaker. He certainly has command of his temper: that is one thing.
      I cannot say whether it favours oratory. He is indefatigable. One may be
      sure he will not faint by the way. He quite believes in himself. But, Mr.
      Austin, do you really regard him as a serious rival?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Austin could not tell. No one could tell the effect of an extended
      franchise. The untried venture of it depressed him. &lsquo;Men have come
      suddenly on a borough before now and carried it,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a borough like Bevisham?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &lsquo;A fluid borough, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkettt interposed: &lsquo;But Ferbrass is quite sure of his district.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia wished to know who the man was, of the mediaevally sounding name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ferbrass is an old lawyer, my dear. He comes of five generations of
      lawyers, and he &lsquo;s as old in the county as Grancey Lespel. Hitherto he has
      always been to be counted on for marching his district to the poll like a
      regiment. That&rsquo;s our strength&mdash;the professions, especially lawyers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are not a great many lawyers Liberals, papa?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A great many barristers are, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereat the colonel and Mr. Austin smiled together.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a new idea to Cecilia that Nevil Beauchamp should be considered by
      a man of the world anything but a well-meaning, moderately ridiculous
      young candidate; and the fact that one so experienced as Seymour Austin
      deemed him an adversary to be grappled with in earnest, created a small
      revolution in her mind, entirely altering her view of the probable
      pliability of his Radicalism under pressure of time and circumstances.
      Many of his remarks, that she had previously half smiled at, came across
      her memory hard as metal. She began to feel some terror of him, and said,
      to reassure herself: &lsquo;Captain Beauchamp is not likely to be a champion
      with a very large following. He is too much of a political mystic, I
      think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Many young men are, before they have written out a fair copy of their
      meaning,&rsquo; said Mr. Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia laughed to herself at the vision of the fiery Nevil engaged in
      writing out a fair copy of his meaning. How many erasures! what
      foot-notes!
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrangement was for Cecilia to proceed to Itchincope alone for a
      couple of days, and bring a party to Mount Laurels through Bevisham by the
      yacht on Thursday, to meet Mr. Seymour Austin and Mr. Everard Romfrey. An
      early day of the next week had been agreed on for the unmasking of the
      second Tory candidate. She promised that in case Nevil Beauchamp should
      have the hardihood to enter the enemy&rsquo;s nest at Itchincope on Wednesday,
      at the great dinner and ball there, she would do her best to bring him
      back to Mount Laurels, that he might meet his uncle Everard, who was
      expected there. At least he may consent to come for an evening,&rsquo; she said.
      &lsquo;Nothing will take him from that canvassing. It seems to me it must be not
      merely distasteful...?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Austin replied: &lsquo;It &lsquo;s disagreeable, but it&rsquo;s&rsquo; the practice. I would
      gladly be bound by a common undertaking to abstain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Captain Beauchamp argues that it would be all to your advantage. He says
      that a personal visit is the only chance for an unknown candidate to make
      the people acquainted with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a very good opportunity for making him acquainted with them; and I
      hope he may profit by it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! pah! &ldquo;To beg the vote and wink the bribe,&rdquo;&rsquo; Colonel Halkett subjoined
      abhorrently:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;&lsquo;It well becomes the Whiggish tribe
        To beg the vote and wink the bribe.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Canvassing means intimidation or corruption.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or the mixture of the two, called cajolery,&rsquo; said Mr. Austin; &lsquo;and that
      was the principal art of the Whigs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus did these gentlemen converse upon canvassing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not possible to gather up in one volume of sound the rattle of the
      knocks at Englishmen&rsquo;s castle-gates during election days; so, with the
      thunder of it unheard, the majesty of the act of canvassing can be but
      barely appreciable, and he, therefore, who would celebrate it must follow
      the candidate obsequiously from door to door, where, like a cross between
      a postman delivering a bill and a beggar craving an alms, patiently he
      attempts the extraction of the vote, as little boys pick periwinkles with
      a pin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is your duty, which I most abjectly entreat you to do,&rsquo; is pretty
      nearly the form of the supplication.
    </p>
    <p>
      How if, instead of the solicitation of the thousands by the unit, the
      meritorious unit were besought by rushing thousands?&mdash;as a mound of
      the plains that is circumvented by floods, and to which the waters cry, Be
      thou our island. Let it be answered the questioner, with no discourteous
      adjectives, Thou fool! To come to such heights of popular discrimination
      and political ardour the people would have to be vivified to a pitch
      little short of eruptive: it would be Boreas blowing AEtna inside them;
      and we should have impulse at work in the country, and immense importance
      attaching to a man&rsquo;s whether he will or he won&rsquo;t&mdash;enough to womanize
      him. We should be all but having Parliament for a sample of our choicest
      rather than our likest: and see you not a peril in that?
    </p>
    <p>
      Conceive, for the fleeting instants permitted to such insufferable flights
      of fancy, our picked men ruling! So despotic an oligarchy as would be
      there, is not a happy subject of contemplation. It is not too much to say
      that a domination of the Intellect in England would at once and entirely
      alter the face of the country. We should be governed by the head with a
      vengeance: all the rest of the country being base members indeed; Spartans&mdash;helots.
      Criticism, now so helpful to us, would wither to the root: fun would die
      out of Parliament, and outside of it: we could never laugh at our masters,
      or command them: and that good old-fashioned shouldering of separate
      interests, which, if it stops progress, like a block in the pit entrance
      to a theatre, proves us equal before the law, puts an end to the pretence
      of higher merit in the one or the other, and renders a stout build the
      safest assurance for coming through ultimately, would be transformed to a
      painful orderliness, like a City procession under the conduct of the
      police, and to classifications of things according to their public value:
      decidedly no benefit to burly freedom. None, if there were no shouldering
      and hustling, could tell whether actually the fittest survived; as is now
      the case among survivors delighting in a broad-chested fitness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And consider the freezing isolation of a body of our quintessential elect,
      seeing below them none to resemble them! Do you not hear in imagination
      the land&rsquo;s regrets for that amiable nobility whose pretensions were
      comically built on birth, acres, tailoring, style, and an air? Ah, that
      these unchallengeable new lords could be exchanged for those old ones!
      These, with the traditions of how great people should look in our country,
      these would pass among us like bergs of ice&mdash;a pure Polar
      aristocracy, inflicting the woes of wintriness upon us. Keep them from
      concentrating! At present I believe it to be their honest opinion, their
      wise opinion, and the sole opinion common to a majority of them, that it
      is more salutary, besides more diverting, to have the fools of the kingdom
      represented than not. As professors of the sarcastic art they can easily
      take the dignity out of the fools&rsquo; representative at their pleasure,
      showing him at antics while he supposes he is exhibiting an honourable and
      a decent series of movements. Generally, too, their archery can check him
      when he is for any of his measures; and if it does not check, there
      appears to be such a property in simple sneering, that it consoles even
      when it fails to right the balance of power. Sarcasm, we well know,
      confers a title of aristocracy straightway and sharp on the sconce of the
      man who does but imagine that he is using it. What, then, must be the
      elevation of these princes of the intellect in their own minds! Hardly
      worth bartering for worldly commanderships, it is evident.
    </p>
    <p>
      Briefly, then, we have a system, not planned but grown, the outcome and
      image of our genius, and all are dissatisfied with parts of it; but, as
      each would preserve his own, the surest guarantee is obtained for the
      integrity of the whole by a happy adjustment of the energies of
      opposition, which&mdash;you have only to look to see&mdash;goes far beyond
      concord in the promotion of harmony. This is our English system; like our
      English pudding, a fortuitous concourse of all the sweets in the grocer&rsquo;s
      shop, but an excellent thing for all that, and let none threaten it.
      Canvassing appears to be mixed up in the system; at least I hope I have
      shown that it will not do to reverse the process, for fear of changes
      leading to a sovereignty of the austere and antipathetic Intellect in our
      England, that would be an inaccessible tyranny of a very small minority,
      necessarily followed by tremendous convulsions.

      Meantime the candidates raised knockers, rang bells, bowed, expounded
      their views, praised their virtues, begged for votes, and greatly and
      strangely did the youngest of them enlarge his knowledge of his
      countrymen. But he had an insatiable appetite, and except in relation to
      Mr. Cougham, considerable tolerance. With Cougham, he was like a young
      hound in the leash. They had to run as twins; but Beauchamp&rsquo;s conjunct
      would not run, he would walk. He imposed his experience on Beauchamp, with
      an assumption that it must necessarily be taken for the law of Beauchamp&rsquo;s
      reason in electoral and in political affairs, and this was hard on
      Beauchamp, who had faith in his reason. Beauchamp&rsquo;s early canvassing
      brought Cougham down to Bevisham earlier than usual in the days when he
      and Seymour Austin divided the borough, and he inclined to administer
      correction to the Radically-disposed youngster. &lsquo;Yes, I have gone all over
      that,&rsquo; he said, in speech sometimes, in manner perpetually, upon the
      intrusion of an idea by his junior. Cougham also, Cougham had passed
      through his Radical phase, as one does on the road to wisdom. So the frog
      telleth tadpoles: he too has wriggled most preposterous of tails; and he
      has shoved a circular flat head into corners unadapted to its shape; and
      that the undeveloped one should dutifully listen to experience and accept
      guidance, is devoutly to be hoped. Alas! Beauchamp would not be taught
      that though they were yoked they stood at the opposite ends of the process
      of evolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oddly coupled pair deplored, among their respective friends, the
      disastrous Siamese twinship created by a haphazard improvident Liberal
      camp. Look at us! they said:&mdash;Beauchamp is a young demagogue; Cougham
      is chrysalis Tory. Such Liberals are the ruin of Liberalism; but of such
      must it be composed when there is no new cry to loosen floods. It was too
      late to think of an operation to divide them. They held the heart of the
      cause between them, were bound fast together, and had to go on. Beauchamp,
      with a furious tug of Radicalism, spoken or performed, pulled Cougham on
      his beam-ends. Cougham, to right himself, defined his Liberalism sharply
      from the politics of the pit, pointed to France and her Revolutions,
      washed his hands of excesses, and entirely overset Beauchamp. Seeing that
      he stood in the Liberal interest, the junior could not abandon the Liberal
      flag; so he seized it and bore it ahead of the time, there where Radicals
      trip their phantom dances like shadows on a fog, and waved it as the very
      flag of our perfectible race. So great was the impetus that Cougham had no
      choice but to step out with him briskly&mdash;voluntarily as a man
      propelled by a hand on his coat-collar. A word saved him: the word
      practical. &lsquo;Are we practical?&rsquo; he inquired, and shivered Beauchamp&rsquo;s
      galloping frame with a violent application of the stop abrupt; for that
      question, &lsquo;Are we practical?&rsquo; penetrates the bosom of an English audience,
      and will surely elicit a response if not plaudits. Practical or not, the
      good people affectingly wish to be thought practical. It has been asked by
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we&rsquo;re not practical, what are we?&mdash;Beauchamp, talking to Cougham
      apart, would argue that the daring and the far-sighted course was often
      the most practical. Cougham extended a deprecating hand: &lsquo;Yes, I have gone
      over all that.&rsquo; Occasionally he was maddening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The melancholy position of the senior and junior Liberals was known abroad
      and matter of derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that the gay and good-humoured young Lord Palmet, heir to the
      earldom of Elsea, walking up the High Street of Bevisham, met Beauchamp on
      Tuesday morning as he sallied out of his hotel to canvass. Lord Palmet was
      one of the numerous half-friends of Cecil Baskelett, and it may be a
      revelation of his character to you, that he owned to liking Beauchamp
      because of his having always been a favourite with the women. He began
      chattering, with Beauchamp&rsquo;s hand in his: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve hit on you, have I? My
      dear fellow, Miss Halkett was talking of you last night. I slept at Mount
      Laurels; went on purpose to have a peep. I&rsquo;m bound for Itchincope. They&rsquo;ve
      some grand procession in view there; Lespel wrote for my team; I suspect
      he&rsquo;s for starting some new October races. He talks of half-a-dozen drags.
      He must have lots of women there. I say, what a splendid creature Cissy
      Halkett has shot up! She topped the season this year, and will next.
      You&rsquo;re for the darkies, Beauchamp. So am I, when I don&rsquo;t see a blonde;
      just as a fellow admires a girl when there&rsquo;s no married woman or widow in
      sight. And, I say, it can&rsquo;t be true you&rsquo;ve gone in for that crazy
      Radicalism? There&rsquo;s nothing to be gained by it, you know; the women hate
      it! A married blonde of five-and-twenty&rsquo;s the Venus of them all. Mind you,
      I don&rsquo;t forget that Mrs. Wardour-Devereux is a thorough-paced brunette;
      but, upon my honour, I&rsquo;d bet on Cissy Halkett at forty. &ldquo;A dark eye in
      woman,&rdquo; if you like, but blue and auburn drive it into a corner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Palmet concluded by asking Beauchamp what he was doing and whither
      going.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp proposed to him maliciously, as one of our hereditary
      legislators, to come and see something of canvassing. Lord Palmet had no
      objection. &lsquo;Capital opportunity for a review of their women,&rsquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I map the places for pretty women in England; some parts of Norfolk, and
      a spot or two in Cumberland and Wales, and the island over there, I know
      thoroughly. Those Jutes have turned out some splendid fair women.
      Devonshire&rsquo;s worth a tour. My man Davis is in charge of my team, and he
      drives to Itchincope from Washwater station. I am independent; I &lsquo;ll have
      an hour with you. Do you think much of the women here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp had not noticed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet observed that he should not have noticed anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you are qualifying for the Upper House,&rsquo; Beauchamp said in the tone
      of an encomium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet accepted the statement. &lsquo;Though I shall never care to figure before
      peeresses,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you why. There&rsquo;s a heavy sprinkling of
      the old bird among them. It isn&rsquo;t that. There&rsquo;s too much plumage; I think
      it must be that. A cloud of millinery shoots me off a mile from a woman.
      In my opinion, witches are the only ones for wearing jewels without
      chilling the feminine atmosphere about them. Fellows think differently.&rsquo; 
      Lord Palmet waved a hand expressive of purely amiable tolerance, for this
      question upon the most important topic of human affairs was deep, and no
      judgement should be hasty in settling it. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m peculiar,&rsquo; he resumed. &lsquo;A
      rose and a string of pearls: a woman who goes beyond that&rsquo;s in danger of
      petrifying herself and her fellow man. Two women in Paris, last winter,
      set us on fire with pale thin gold ornaments&mdash;neck, wrists, ears,
      ruche, skirts, all in a flutter, and so were you. But you felt witchcraft.
      &ldquo;The magical Orient,&rdquo; Vivian Ducie called the blonde, and the dark beauty,
      &ldquo;Young Endor.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her name?&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A marquise; I forget her name. The other was Countess Rastaglione; you
      must have heard of her; a towering witch, an empress, Helen of Troy;
      though Ducie would have it the brunette was Queen of Paris. For French
      taste, if you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Countess Rastaglione was a lady enamelled on the scroll of Fame. &lsquo;Did you
      see them together?&rsquo; said Beauchamp. &lsquo;They weren&rsquo;t together?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet looked at him and laughed. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re yourself again, are you? Go to
      Paris in January, and cut out the Frenchmen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Answer me, Palmet: they weren&rsquo;t in couples?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fancy not. It was luck to meet them, so they couldn&rsquo;t have been.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you dance with either of them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Unable to state accurately that he had, Palmet cried, &lsquo;Oh! for dancing,
      the Frenchwoman beat the Italian.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you see her often&mdash;more than once?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear fellow, I went everywhere to see her: balls, theatres,
      promenades, rides, churches.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you say she dressed up to the Italian, to challenge her, rival her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only one night; simple accident. Everybody noticed it, for they stood for
      Night and Day,&mdash;both hung with gold; the brunette Etruscan, and the
      blonde Asiatic; and every Frenchman present was epigramizing up and down
      the rooms like mad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her husband &lsquo;s Legitimist; he wouldn&rsquo;t be at the Tuileries?&rsquo; Beauchamp
      spoke half to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, then, what?&rsquo; Palmet stared and chuckled. &lsquo;Her husband must have
      taken the Tuileries&rsquo; bait, if we mean the same woman. My dear old
      Beauchamp, have I seen her, then? She&rsquo;s a darling! The Rastaglione was
      nothing to her. When you do light on a grand smoky pearl, the milky ones
      may go and decorate plaster. That&rsquo;s what I say of the loveliest brunettes.
      It must be the same: there can&rsquo;t be a couple of dark beauties in Paris
      without a noise about them. Marquise&mdash;? I shall recollect her name
      presently.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s one of the houses I stop at,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, &lsquo;and drop that
      subject.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A scared servant-girl brought out her wizened mistress to confront the
      candidate, and to this representative of the sex he addressed his arts of
      persuasion, requesting her to repeat his words to her husband. The
      contrast between Beauchamp palpably canvassing and the Beauchamp who was
      the lover of the Marquise of the forgotten name, struck too powerfully on
      Palmet for his gravity he retreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp found him sauntering on the pavement, and would have dismissed
      him but for an agreeable diversion that occurred at that moment. A suavely
      smiling unctuous old gentleman advanced to them, bowing, and presuming
      thus far, he said, under the supposition that he was accosting the junior
      Liberal candidate for the borough. He announced his name and his
      principles Tomlinson, progressive Liberal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A true distinction from some Liberals I know,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tomlinson hoped so. Never, he said, did he leave it to the man of his
      choice at an election to knock at his door for the vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp looked as if he had swallowed a cordial. Votes falling into his
      lap are heavenly gifts to the candidate sick of the knocker and the bell.
      Mr. Tomlinson eulogized the manly candour of the junior Liberal
      candidate&rsquo;s address, in which he professed to see ideas that distinguished
      it from the address of the sound but otherwise conventional Liberal, Mr.
      Cougham. He muttered of plumping for Beauchamp. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t plump,&rsquo; Beauchamp
      said; and a candidate, if he would be an honourable twin, must say it.
      Cougham had cautioned him against the heresy of plumping.
    </p>
    <p>
      They discoursed of the poor and their beverages, of pothouses, of the
      anti-liquorites, and of the duties of parsons, and the value of a robust
      and right-minded body of the poor to the country. Palmet found himself
      following them into a tolerably spacious house that he took to be the old
      gentleman&rsquo;s until some of the apparatus of an Institute for literary and
      scientific instruction revealed itself to him, and he heard Mr. Tomlinson
      exalt the memory of one Wingham for the blessing bequeathed by him to the
      town of Bevisham. &lsquo;For,&rsquo; said Mr. Tomlinson, &lsquo;it is open to both sexes, to
      all respectable classes, from ten in the morning up to ten at night. Such
      a place affords us, I would venture to say, the advantages without the
      seductions of a Club. I rank it next&mdash;at a far remove, but next-the
      church.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Palmet brought his eyes down from the busts of certain worthies
      ranged along the top of the book-shelves to the cushioned chairs, and
      murmured, &lsquo;Capital place for an appointment with a woman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tomlinson gazed up at him mildly, with a fallen countenance. He turned
      sadly agape in silence to the busts, the books, and the range of
      scientific instruments, and directed a gaze under his eyebrows at
      Beauchamp. &lsquo;Does your friend canvass with you?&rsquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want him to taste it,&rsquo; Beauchamp replied, and immediately introduced
      the affable young lord&mdash;a proceeding marked by some of the dexterity
      he had once been famous for, as was shown by a subsequent observation of
      Mr. Tomlinson&rsquo;s:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, on the question of classes, &lsquo;yes, I fear we have classes
      in this country whose habitual levity sharp experience will have to
      correct. I very much fear it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if you have classes that are not to face realities classes that look
      on them from the box-seats of a theatre,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, &lsquo;how can you
      expect perfect seriousness, or any good service whatever?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gently, sir, gently. No; we can, I feel confident, expand within the
      limits of our most excellent and approved Constitution. I could wish that
      socially... that is all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Socially and politically mean one thing in the end,&rsquo; said Beauchamp. &lsquo;If
      you have a nation politically corrupt, you won&rsquo;t have a good state of
      morals in it, and the laws that keep society together bear upon the
      politics of a country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True; yes,&rsquo; Mr. Tomlinson hesitated assent. He dissociated Beauchamp from
      Lord Palmet, but felt keenly that the latter&rsquo;s presence desecrated
      Wingham&rsquo;s Institute, and he informed the candidate that he thought he
      would no longer detain him from his labours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just the sort of place wanted in every provincial town,&rsquo; Palmet remarked
      by way of a parting compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tomlinson bowed a civil acknowledgement of his having again spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      No further mention was made of the miraculous vote which had risen
      responsive to the candidate&rsquo;s address of its own inspired motion; so
      Beauchamp said, &lsquo;I beg you to bear in mind that I request you not to
      plump.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may be right, Captain Beauchamp. Good day, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet strode after Beauchamp into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did you set me bowing to that old boy?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did you talk about women?&rsquo; was the rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, aha!&rsquo; Palmet sang to himself. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a Romfrey, Beauchamp. A blow
      for a blow! But I only said what would strike every fellow first off. It
      is the place; the very place. Pastry-cooks&rsquo; shops won&rsquo;t stand comparison
      with it. Don&rsquo;t tell me you &lsquo;re the man not to see how much a woman prefers
      to be under the wing of science and literature, in a good-sized,
      well-warmed room, with a book, instead of making believe, with a red face,
      over a tart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He received a smart lecture from Beauchamp, and began to think he had
      enough of canvassing. But he was not suffered to escape. For his
      instruction, for his positive and extreme good, Beauchamp determined that
      the heir to an earldom should have a day&rsquo;s lesson. We will hope there was
      no intention to punish him for having frozen the genial current of Mr.
      Tomlinson&rsquo;s vote and interest; and it may be that he clung to one who had,
      as he imagined, seen Renee. Accompanied by a Mr. Oggler, a tradesman of
      the town, on the Liberal committee, dressed in a pea-jacket and proudly
      nautical, they applied for the vote, and found it oftener than beauty.
      Palmet contrasted his repeated disappointments with the scoring of two,
      three, four and more in the candidate&rsquo;s list, and informed him that he
      would certainly get the Election. &lsquo;I think you&rsquo;re sure of it,&rsquo; he said.
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s not a pretty woman to be seen; not one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      One came up to them, the sight of whom counselled Lord Palmet to
      reconsider his verdict. She was addressed by Beauchamp as Miss Denham, and
      soon passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet was guilty of staring at her, and of lingering behind the others
      for a last look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were on the steps of a voter&rsquo;s house, calmly enduring a rebuff from
      him in person, when Palmet returned to them, exclaiming effusively, &lsquo;What
      luck you have, Beauchamp!&rsquo; He stopped till the applicants descended the
      steps, with the voice of the voter ringing contempt as well as refusal in
      their ears; then continued: &lsquo;You introduced me neck and heels to that
      undertakerly old Tomlinson, of Wingham&rsquo;s Institute; you might have given
      me a chance with that Miss&mdash;Miss Denham, was it? She has a bit of a
      style!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has a head,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A girl like that may have what she likes. I don&rsquo;t care what she has&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      woman in her. You might take her for a younger sister of Mrs.
      Wardour-Devereux. Who &lsquo;s the uncle she speaks of? She ought not to be
      allowed to walk out by herself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She can take care of herself,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet denied it. &lsquo;No woman can. Upon my honour, it&rsquo;s a shame that she
      should be out alone. What are her people? I&rsquo;ll run&mdash;from you, you
      know&mdash;and see her safe home. There&rsquo;s such an infernal lot of fellows
      about; and a girl simply bewitching and unprotected! I ought to be after
      her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp held him firmly to the task of canvassing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then will you tell me where she lives?&rsquo; Palmet stipulated. He reproached
      Beauchamp for a notorious Grand Turk exclusiveness and greediness in
      regard to women, as well as a disposition to run hard races for them out
      of a spirit of pure rivalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use contradicting, it&rsquo;s universally known of you,&rsquo; reiterated
      Palmet. &lsquo;I could name a dozen women, and dozens of fellows you
      deliberately set yourself to cut out, for the honour of it. What&rsquo;s that
      story they tell of you in one of the American cities or watering-places,
      North or South? You would dance at a ball a dozen times with a girl
      engaged to a man&mdash;who drenched you with a tumbler at the hotel bar,
      and off you all marched to the sands and exchanged shots from revolvers;
      and both of you, they say, saw the body of a drowned sailor in the water,
      in the moonlight, heaving nearer and nearer, and you stretched your man
      just as the body was flung up by a wave between you. Picturesque, if you
      like!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dramatic, certainly. And I ran away with the bride next morning?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; roared Palmet; &lsquo;you didn&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s the cruelty of the whole
      affair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp laughed. &lsquo;An old messmate of mine, Lieutenant Jack Wilmore, can
      give you a different version of the story. I never have fought a duel, and
      never will. Here we are at the shop of a tough voter, Mr. Oggler. So it
      says in my note-book. Shall we put Lord Palmet to speak to him first?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If his lordship will put his heart into what he says,&rsquo; Mr. Oggler bowed.
      &lsquo;Are you for giving the people recreation on a Sunday, my lord?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Trap-bat and ball, cricket, dancing, military bands, puppet-shows,
      theatres, merry-go-rounds, bosky dells&mdash;anything to make them happy,&rsquo; 
      said Palmet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, dear! then I &lsquo;m afraid we cannot ask you to speak to this Mr.
      Carpendike.&rsquo; Oggler shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does the fellow want the people to be miserable?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, my lord, he would rather see them miserable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They introduced themselves to Mr. Carpendike in his shop. He was a
      flat-chested, sallow young shoemaker, with a shelving forehead, who seeing
      three gentlemen enter to him recognized at once with a practised
      resignation that they had not come to order shoe-leather, though he would
      fain have shod them, being needy; but it was not the design of Providence
      that they should so come as he in his blindness would have had them.
      Admitting this he wished for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle with Carpendike lasted three-quarters of an hour, during which
      he was chiefly and most effectively silent. Carpendike would not vote for
      a man that proposed to open museums on the Sabbath day. The striking
      simile of the thin end of the wedge was recurred to by him for a damning
      illustration. Captain Beauchamp might be honest in putting his mind on
      most questions in his address, when there was no demand upon him to do it;
      but honesty was no antidote to impiety. Thus Carpendike.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Sunday museuming being an antidote to the pothouse&mdash;no. For the
      people knew the frequenting of the pothouse to be a vice; it was a
      temptation of Satan that often in overcoming them was the cause of their
      flying back to grace: whereas museums and picture galleries were insidious
      attractions cloaked by the name of virtue, whereby they were allured to
      abandon worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp flew at this young monster of unreason: &lsquo;But the people are not
      worshipping; they are idling and sotting, and if you carry your despotism
      farther still, and shut them out of every shop on Sundays, do you suppose
      you promote the spirit of worship? If you don&rsquo;t revolt them you unman
      them, and I warn you we can&rsquo;t afford to destroy what manhood remains to us
      in England. Look at the facts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He flung the facts at Carpendike with the natural exaggeration of them
      which eloquence produces, rather, as a rule, to assure itself in passing
      of the overwhelming justice of the cause it pleads than to deceive the
      adversary. Brewers&rsquo; beer and publicans&rsquo; beer, wife-beatings, the homes and
      the blood of the people, were matters reviewed to the confusion of
      Sabbatarians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carpendike listened with a bent head, upraised eyes, and brows wrinkling
      far on to his poll: a picture of a mind entrenched beyond the
      potentialities of mortal assault. He signified that he had spoken. Indeed
      Beauchamp&rsquo;s reply was vain to one whose argument was that he considered
      the people nearer to holiness in the indulging of an evil propensity than
      in satisfying a harmless curiosity and getting a recreation. The Sabbath
      claimed them; if they were disobedient, Sin ultimately might scourge them
      back to the fold, but never if they were permitted to regard themselves as
      innocent in their backsliding and rebelliousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such language was quite new to Beauchamp. The parsons he had spoken to
      were of one voice in objecting to the pothouse. He appealed to
      Carpendike&rsquo;s humanity. Carpendike smote him with a text from Scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Devilish cold in this shop,&rsquo; muttered Palmet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two not flourishing little children of the emaciated Puritan burst into
      the shop, followed by their mother, carrying a child in her arms. She had
      a sad look, upon traces of a past fairness, vaguely like a snow landscape
      in the thaw. Palmet stooped to toss shillings with her young ones, that he
      might avoid the woman&rsquo;s face. It cramped his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, Mr. Carpendike,&rsquo; said fat Mr. Oggler, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s the happiness
      of the people we want; that&rsquo;s what Captain Beauchamp works for&mdash;their
      happiness; that&rsquo;s the aim of life for all of us. Look at me! I&rsquo;m as happy
      as the day. I pray every night, and I go to church every Sunday, and I
      never know what it is to be unhappy. The Lord has blessed me with a good
      digestion, healthy pious children, and a prosperous shop that&rsquo;s a
      competency&mdash;a modest one, but I make it satisfy me, because I know
      it&rsquo;s the Lord&rsquo;s gift. Well, now, and I hate Sabbath-breakers; I would
      punish them; and I&rsquo;m against the public-houses on a Sunday; but aboard my
      little yacht, say on a Sunday morning in the Channel, I don&rsquo;t forget I owe
      it to the Lord that he has been good enough to put me in the way of
      keeping a yacht; no; I read prayers to my crew, and a chapter in the
      Bible-Genesis, Deuteronomy, Kings, Acts, Paul, just as it comes. All&rsquo;s
      good that&rsquo;s there. Then we&rsquo;re free for the day! man, boy, and me; we cook
      our victuals, and we must look to the yacht, do you see. But we&rsquo;ve made
      our peace with the Almighty. We know that. He don&rsquo;t mind the working of
      the vessel so long as we&rsquo;ve remembered him. He put us in that situation,
      exactly there, latitude and longitude, do you see, and work the vessel we
      must. And a glass of grog and a pipe after dinner, can&rsquo;t be any offence.
      And I tell you, honestly and sincerely, I&rsquo;m sure my conscience is good,
      and I really and truly don&rsquo;t know what it is not to know happiness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know God,&rsquo; said Carpendike, like a voice from a cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or nature: or the state of the world,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, singularly
      impressed to find himself between two men, of whom&mdash;each perforce of
      his tenuity and the evident leaning of his appetites&mdash;one was for the
      barren black view of existence, the other for the fantastically bright. As
      to the men personally, he chose Carpendike, for all his obstinacy and
      sourness. Oggler&rsquo;s genial piety made him shrink with nausea.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lord Palmet paid Mr. Oggler a memorable compliment, by assuring him
      that he was altogether of his way of thinking about happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frank young nobleman did not withhold a reference to the two or three
      things essential to his happiness; otherwise Mr. Oggler might have been
      pleased and flattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before quitting the shop, Beauchamp warned Carpendike that he should come
      again. &lsquo;Vote or no vote, you&rsquo;re worth the trial. Texts as many as you
      like. I&rsquo;ll make your faith active, if it&rsquo;s alive at all. You speak of the
      Lord loving his own; you make out the Lord to be your own, and use your
      religion like a drug. So it appears to me. That Sunday tyranny of yours
      has to be defended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember that; for I for one shall combat it and expose it. Good day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp continued, in the street: &lsquo;Tyrannies like this fellow&rsquo;s have
      made the English the dullest and wretchedest people in Europe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet animadverted on Carpendike: &lsquo;The dog looks like a deadly fungus
      that has poisoned the woman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d trust him with a post of danger, though,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the candidate had opened his mouth to the next elector he was
      beamed on. M&rsquo;Gilliper, baker, a floured brick face, leaned on folded arms
      across his counter and said, in Scotch: &lsquo;My vote? and he that asks me for
      my vote is the man who, when he was midshipman, saved the life of a
      relation of mine from death by drowning! my wife&rsquo;s first cousin, Johnny
      Brownson&mdash;and held him up four to five minutes in the water, and
      never left him till he was out of danger! There &lsquo;s my hand on it, I will,
      and a score of householders in Bevisham the same.&rsquo; He dictated precious
      names and addresses to Beauchamp, and was curtly thanked for his pains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such treatment of a favourable voter seemed odd to Palmet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, a vote given for reasons of sentiment!&rsquo; Beauchamp interjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet reflected and said: &lsquo;Well, perhaps that&rsquo;s how it is women don&rsquo;t
      care uncommonly for the men who love them, though they like precious well
      to be loved. Opposition does it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have discovered my likeness to women,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, eyeing him
      critically, and then thinking, with a sudden warmth, that he had seen
      Renee: &lsquo;Look here, Palmet, you&rsquo;re too late for Itchincope, to-day; come
      and eat fish and meat with me at my hotel, and come to a meeting after it.
      You can run by rail to Itchincope to breakfast in the morning, and I may
      come with you. You&rsquo;ll hear one or two men speak well to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose I shall have to be at this business myself some day,&rsquo; sighed
      Palmet. &lsquo;Any women on the platform? Oh, but political women! And the
      Tories get the pick of the women. No, I don&rsquo;t think I &lsquo;ll stay. Yes, I
      will; I&rsquo;ll go through with it. I like to be learning something. You
      wouldn&rsquo;t think it of me, Beauchamp, but I envy fellows at work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You might make a speech for me, Palmet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No man better, my dear fellow, if it were proposing a toast to the poor
      devils and asking them to drink it. But a dry speech, like leading them
      over the desert without a well to cheer them&mdash;no oasis, as we used to
      call a five-pound note and a holiday&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t the heart for that.
      Is your Miss Denham a Radical?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp asserted that he had not yet met a woman at all inclining in the
      direction of Radicalism. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t call furies Radicals. There may be women
      who think as well as feel; I don&rsquo;t know them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lots of them, Beauchamp. Take my word for it. I do know women. They
      haven&rsquo;t a shift, nor a trick, I don&rsquo;t know. They&rsquo;re as clear to me as
      glass. I&rsquo;ll wager your Miss Denham goes to the meetings. Now, doesn&rsquo;t she?
      Of course she does. And there couldn&rsquo;t be a gallanter way of spending an
      evening, so I&rsquo;ll try it. Nothing to repent of next morning! That&rsquo;s to be
      said for politics, Beauchamp, and I confess I&rsquo;m rather jealous of you. A
      thoroughly good-looking girl who takes to a fellow for what he&rsquo;s doing in
      the world, must have ideas of him precious different from the adoration of
      six feet three and a fine seat in the saddle. I see that. There&rsquo;s
      Baskelett in the Blues; and if I were he I should detest my cuirass and
      helmet, for if he&rsquo;s half as successful as he boasts&mdash;it&rsquo;s the
      uniform.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Two notorious Radicals, Peter Molyneux and Samuel Killick, were called on.
      The first saw Beauchamp and refused him; the second declined to see him.
      He was amazed and staggered, but said little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the remainder of the electors of Bevisham, roused that day to a
      sense of their independence by the summons of the candidates, only one man
      made himself conspicuous, by premising that he had two important questions
      to ask, and he trusted Commander Beauchamp to answer them unreservedly.
      They were: first, What is a FRENCH MARQUEES? and second: Who was
      EURYDICEY?
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp referred him to the Tory camp, whence the placard alluding to
      those ladies had issued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Both of them &lsquo;s ladies! I guessed it,&rsquo; said the elector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you guess that one of them is a mythological lady?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not far wrong in guessing t&rsquo;other&rsquo;s not much better, I reckon. Now,
      sir, may I ask you, is there any tale concerning your morals?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No: you may not ask; you take a liberty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll take the liberty to postpone talking about my vote. Look here,
      Mr. Commander; if the upper classes want anything of me and come to me for
      it, I&rsquo;ll know what sort of an example they&rsquo;re setting; now that&rsquo;s me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You pay attention to a stupid Tory squib?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where there&rsquo;s smoke there&rsquo;s fire, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp glanced at his note-book for the name of this man, who was a
      ragman and dustman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My private character has nothing whatever to do with my politics,&rsquo; he
      said, and had barely said it when he remembered having spoken somewhat
      differently, upon the abstract consideration of the case, to Mr.
      Tomlinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re quite welcome to examine my character for yourself, only I don&rsquo;t
      consent to be catechized. Understand that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You quite understand that, Mr. Tripehallow,&rsquo; said Oggler, bolder in
      taking up the strange name than Beauchamp had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I understand that. But you understand, there&rsquo;s never been a word against
      the morals of Mr. Cougham. Here&rsquo;s the point: Do we mean to be a moral
      country? Very well, then so let our representatives be, I say. And if I
      hear nothing against your morals, Mr. Commander, I don&rsquo;t say you shan&rsquo;t
      have my vote. I mean to deliberate. You young nobs capering over our heads&mdash;I
      nail you down to morals. Politics secondary. Adew, as the dying spirit
      remarked to weeping friends.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Au revoir&mdash;would have been kinder,&rsquo; said Palmet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tripehallow smiled roguishly, to betoken comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp asked Mr. Oggler whether that fellow was to be taken for a
      humourist or a five-pound-note man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It may be both, sir. I know he&rsquo;s called Morality Joseph.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      An all but acknowledged five-pound-note man was the last they visited. He
      cut short the preliminaries of the interview by saying that he was a
      four-o&rsquo;clock man; i.e. the man who waited for the final bids to him upon
      the closing hour of the election day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not one farthing!&rsquo; said Beauchamp, having been warned beforehand of the
      signification of the phrase by his canvassing lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you&rsquo;re nowhere,&rsquo; the honest fellow replied in the mystic tongue of
      prophecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet and Beauchamp went to their fish and meat; smoked a cigarette or
      two afterward, conjured away the smell of tobacco from their persons as
      well as they could, and betook themselves to the assembly-room of the
      Liberal party, where the young lord had an opportunity of beholding Mr.
      Cougham, and of listening to him for an hour and forty minutes. He heard
      Mr. Timothy Turbot likewise. And Miss Denham was present. Lord Palmet
      applauded when she smiled. When she looked attentive he was deeply
      studious. Her expression of fatigue under the sonorous ring of statistics
      poured out from Cougham was translated by Palmet into yawns and sighs of a
      profoundly fraternal sympathy. Her face quickened on the rising of
      Beauchamp to speak. She kept eye on him all the while, as Palmet, with the
      skill of an adept in disguising his petty larceny of the optics, did on
      her. Twice or thrice she looked pained: Beauchamp was hesitating for the
      word. Once she looked startled and shut her eyes: a hiss had sounded;
      Beauchamp sprang on it as if enlivened by hostility, and dominated the
      factious note. Thereat she turned to a gentleman sitting beside her;
      apparently they agreed that some incident had occurred characteristic of
      Nevil Beauchamp; for whom, however, it was not a brilliant evening. He was
      very well able to account for it, and did so, after he had walked a few
      steps with Miss Denham on her homeward way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You heard Cougham, Palmet! He&rsquo;s my senior, and I&rsquo;m obliged to come second
      to him, and how am I to have a chance when he has drenched the audience
      for close upon a couple of hours!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet mimicked the manner of Cougham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They cry for Turbot naturally; they want a relief,&rsquo; Beauchamp groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet gave an imitation of Timothy Turbot.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an admirable mimic, perfectly spontaneous, without stressing any
      points, and Beauchamp was provoked to laugh his discontentment with the
      evening out of recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a grave matter troubled Palmet&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who was that fellow who walked off with Miss Denham?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A married man,&rsquo; said Beauchamp: &lsquo;badly married; more &lsquo;s the pity; he has
      a wife in the madhouse. His name is Lydiard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not her brother! Where&rsquo;s her uncle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She won&rsquo;t let him come to these meetings. It&rsquo;s her idea; well-intended,
      but wrong, I think. She&rsquo;s afraid that Dr. Shrapnel will alarm the moderate
      Liberals and damage Radical me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet muttered between his teeth, &lsquo;What queer things they let their women
      do!&rsquo; He felt compelled to say, &lsquo;Odd for her to be walking home at night
      with a fellow like that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It chimed too consonantly with a feeling of Beauchamp&rsquo;s, to repress which
      he replied: &lsquo;Your ideas about women are simply barbarous, Palmet. Why
      shouldn&rsquo;t she? Her uncle places his confidence in the man, and in her.
      Isn&rsquo;t that better&mdash;ten times more likely to call out the sense of
      honour and loyalty, than the distrust and the scandal going on in your
      class?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please to say yours too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no class. I say that the education for women is to teach them to
      rely on themselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! well, I don&rsquo;t object, if I&rsquo;m the man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because you and your set are absolutely uncivilized in your views of
      women.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Common sense, Beauchamp!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Prey. You eye them as prey. And it comes of an idle aristocracy. You have
      no faith in them, and they repay you for your suspicion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All the same, Beauchamp, she ought not to be allowed to go about at night
      with that fellow. &ldquo;Rich and rare were the gems she wore&rdquo;: but that was in
      Erin&rsquo;s isle, and if we knew the whole history, she&rsquo;d better have stopped
      at home. She&rsquo;s marvellously pretty, to my mind. She looks a high-bred
      wench. Odd it is, Beauchamp, to see a lady&rsquo;s-maid now and then catch the
      style of my lady. No, by Jove! I&rsquo;ve known one or two&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t
      tell the difference! Not till you were intimate. I know one would walk a
      minuet with a duchess. Of course&mdash;all the worse for her. If you see
      that uncle of Miss Denham&rsquo;s&mdash;upon my honour, I should advise him: I
      mean, counsel him not to trust her with any fellow but you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp asked Lord Palmet how old he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet gave his age; correcting the figures from six-and-twenty to one
      year more. &lsquo;And never did a stroke of work in my life,&rsquo; he said, speaking
      genially out of an acute guess at the sentiments of the man he walked
      with.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed a farcical state of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a kind of contrition in Palmet&rsquo;s voice, and to put him at his
      ease, as well as to stamp something in his own mind, Beauchamp said: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
      common enough.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. A DAY AT ITCHINCOPE
    </h2>
    <p>
      An election in Bevisham was always an exciting period at Itchincope, the
      large and influential old estate of the Lespels, which at one time, with
      but a ceremonious drive through the town, sent you two good Whig men to
      Parliament to sit at Reform banquets; two unswerving party men, blest
      subscribers to the right Review, and personally proud of its trenchancy.
      Mr. Grancey Lespel was the survivor of them, and well could he remember
      the happier day of his grandfather, his father, and his own hot youth. He
      could be carried so far by affectionate regrets as to think of the Tories
      of that day benignly:&mdash;when his champion Review of the orange and
      blue livery waved a wondrous sharp knife, and stuck and bled them, proving
      to his party, by trenchancy alone, that the Whig was the cause of
      Providence. Then politics presented you a table whereat two parties
      feasted, with no fear of the intrusion of a third, and your backs were
      turned on the noisy lower world, your ears were deaf to it.

      Mr. Grancey Lespel would still have been sitting for Bevisham (or politely
      at this elective moment bowing to resume the seat) had not those
      Manchester jugglers caught up his cry, appropriated his colours, displaced
      and impersonated him, acting beneficent Whig on a scale approaching
      treason to the Constitution; leaning on the people in earnest, instead of
      taking the popular shoulder for a temporary lift, all in high party
      policy, for the clever manoeuvre, to oust the Tory and sway the realm. See
      the consequences. For power, for no other consideration, those
      manufacturing rascals have raised Radicalism from its primaeval mire&mdash;from
      its petty backslum bookseller&rsquo;s shop and public-house back-parlour
      effluvia of oratory&mdash;to issue dictates in England, and we, England,
      formerly the oak, are topsy-turvy, like onions, our heels in the air!
    </p>
    <p>
      The language of party is eloquent, and famous for being grand at
      illustration; but it is equally well known that much of it gives us humble
      ideas of the speaker, probably because of the naughty temper party is
      prone to; which, while endowing it with vehemence, lessens the stout
      circumferential view that should be taken, at least historically. Indeed,
      though we admit party to be the soundest method for conducting us, party
      talk soon expends its attractiveness, as would a summer&rsquo;s afternoon given
      up to the contemplation of an encounter of rams&rsquo; heads. Let us be quit of
      Mr. Grancey Lespel&rsquo;s lamentations. The Whig gentleman had some reason to
      complain. He had been trained to expect no other attack than that of his
      hereditary adversary-ram in front, and a sham ram&mdash;no honest animal,
      but a ramming engine rather&mdash;had attacked him in the rear. Like Mr.
      Everard Romfrey and other Whigs, he was profoundly chagrined by popular
      ingratitude: &lsquo;not the same man,&rsquo; his wife said of him. It nipped him
      early. He took to proverbs; sure sign of the sere leaf in a man&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife reproached the people for their behaviour to him bitterly. The
      lady regarded politics as a business that helped hunting-men a stage above
      sportsmen, for numbers of the politicians she was acquainted with were
      hunting-men, yet something more by virtue of the variety they could
      introduce into a conversation ordinarily treating of sport and the
      qualities of wines. Her husband seemed to have lost in that Parliamentary
      seat the talisman which gave him notions distinguishing him from country
      squires; he had sunk, and he no longer cared for the months in London, nor
      for the speeches she read to him to re-awaken his mind and make him look
      out of himself, as he had done when he was a younger man and not a
      suspended Whig. Her own favourite reading was of love-adventures written
      in the French tongue. She had once been in love, and could be so
      sympathetic with that passion as to avow to Cecilia Halkett a tenderness
      for Nevil Beauchamp, on account of his relations with the Marquise de
      Rouaillout, and notwithstanding the demoniacal flame-halo of the Radical
      encircling him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The allusion to Beauchamp occurred a few hours after Cecilia&rsquo;s arrival at
      Itchincope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia begged for the French lady&rsquo;s name to be repeated; she had not
      heard it before, and she tasted the strange bitter relish of realization
      when it struck her ear to confirm a story that she believed indeed, but
      had not quite sensibly felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And it is not over yet, they say,&rsquo; Mrs. Grancey Lespel added, while
      softly flipping some spots of the colour proper to radicals in morals on
      the fame of the French lady. She possessed fully the grave judicial spirit
      of her countrywomen, and could sit in judgement on the personages of tales
      which had entranced her, to condemn the heroines: it was impolitic in her
      sex to pity females. As for the men&mdash;poor weak things! As for Nevil
      Beauchamp, in particular, his case, this penetrating lady said, was clear:
      he ought to be married. &lsquo;Could you make a sacrifice?&rsquo; she asked Cecilia
      playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil Beauchamp and I are old friends, but we have agreed that we are
      deadly political enemies,&rsquo; Miss Halkett replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not so bad for a beginning,&rsquo; said Mrs. Lespel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If one were disposed to martyrdom.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The older woman nodded. &lsquo;Without that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Mrs. Lespel, wait till you have heard him. He is at war with
      everything we venerate and build on. The wife you would give him should be
      a creature rooted in nothing&mdash;in sea-water. Simply two or three
      conversations with him have made me uncomfortable ever since; I can see
      nothing durable; I dream of surprises, outbreaks, dreadful events. At
      least it is perfectly true that I do not look with the same eyes on my
      country. He seems to delight in destroying one&rsquo;s peaceful contemplation of
      life. The truth is that he blows a perpetual gale, and is all agitation,&rsquo; 
      Cecilia concluded, affecting with a smile a slight shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, one tires of that,&rsquo; said Mrs. Lespel. &lsquo;I was determined I would have
      him here if we could get him to come. Grancey objected. We shall have to
      manage Captain Beauchamp and the rest as well. He is sure to come late
      to-morrow, and will leave early on Thursday morning for his canvass; our
      driving into Bevisham is for Friday or Saturday. I do not see that he need
      have any suspicions. Those verses you are so angry about cannot be traced
      to Itchincope. My dear, they are a childish trifle. When my husband stood
      first for Bevisham, the whole of his University life appeared in print.
      What we have to do is to forewarn the gentlemen to be guarded, and
      especially in what they say to my nephew Lord Palmet, for that boy cannot
      keep a secret; he is as open as a plate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The smoking-room at night?&rsquo; Cecilia suggested, remembering her father&rsquo;s
      words about Itchincope&rsquo;s tobacco-hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They have Captain Beauchamp&rsquo;s address hung up there, I have heard,&rsquo; said
      Mrs. Lespel. &lsquo;There may be other things&mdash;another address, though it
      is not yet, placarded. Come with me. For fifteen years I have never once
      put my head into that room, and now I &lsquo;ve a superstitious fear about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lespel led the way to the deserted smoking-room, where the stale reek
      of tobacco assailed the ladies, as does that dire place of Customs the
      stranger visiting savage (or too natural) potentates.
    </p>
    <p>
      In silence they tore down from the wall Beauchamp&rsquo;s electoral Address&mdash;flanked
      all its length with satirical pen and pencil comments and sketches; and
      they consigned to flames the vast sheet of animated verses relating to the
      FRENCH MARQUEES. A quarter-size chalk-drawing of a slippered pantaloon
      having a duck on his shoulder, labelled to say &lsquo;Quack-quack,&rsquo; and offering
      our nauseated Dame Britannia (or else it was the widow Bevisham) a globe
      of a pill to swallow, crossed with the consolatory and reassuring name of
      Shrapnel, they disposed of likewise. And then they fled, chased forth
      either by the brilliancy of the politically allusive epigrams profusely
      inscribed around them on the walls, or by the atmosphere. Mrs. Lespel gave
      her orders for the walls to be scraped, and said to Cecilia: &lsquo;A strange
      air to breathe, was it not? The less men and women know of one another,
      the happier for them. I knew my superstition was correct as a guide to me.
      I do so much wish to respect men, and all my experience tells me the Turks
      know best how to preserve it for us. Two men in this house would give
      their wives for pipes, if it came to the choice. We might all go for a
      cellar of old wine. After forty, men have married their habits, and wives
      are only an item in the list, and not the most important.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With the assistance of Mr. Stukely Culbrett, Mrs. Lespel prepared the
      house and those of the company who were in the secret of affairs for the
      arrival of Beauchamp. The ladies were curious to see him. The gentlemen,
      not anticipating extreme amusement, were calm: for it is an axiom in the
      world of buckskins and billiard-cues, that one man is very like another;
      and so true is it with them, that they can in time teach it to the fair
      sex. Friends of Cecil Baskelett predominated, and the absence of so
      sprightly a fellow was regretted seriously; but he was shooting with his
      uncle at Holdesbury, and they did not expect him before Thursday.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Wednesday morning Lord Palmet presented himself at a remarkably
      well-attended breakfast-table at Itchincope. He passed from Mrs. Lespel to
      Mrs. Wardour-Devsreux and Miss Halkett, bowed to other ladies, shook hands
      with two or three men, and nodded over the heads of half-a-dozen,
      accounting rather mysteriously for his delay in coming, it was thought,
      until he sat down before a plate of Yorkshire pie, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fact is I&rsquo;ve been canvassing hard. With Beauchamp!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Astonishment and laughter surrounded him, and Palmet looked from face to
      face, equally astonished, and desirous to laugh too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ernest! how could you do that?&rsquo; said Mrs. Lespel; and her husband cried
      in stupefaction, &lsquo;With Beauchamp?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s because of the Radicalism,&rsquo; Palmet murmured to himself. &lsquo;I
      didn&rsquo;t mind that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What sort of a day did you have?&rsquo; Mr. Culbrett asked him; and several
      gentlemen fell upon him for an account of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet grimaced over a mouthful of his pie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bad!&rsquo; quoth Mr. Lespel; &lsquo;I knew it. I know Bevisham. The only chance
      there is for five thousand pounds in a sack with a hole in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bad for Beauchamp? Dear me, no&rsquo;; Palmet corrected the error. &lsquo;He is
      carrying all before him. And he tells them,&rsquo; Palmet mimicked Beauchamp,
      &lsquo;they shall not have one penny: not a farthing. I gave a couple of young
      ones a shilling apiece, and he rowed me for bribery; somehow I did wrong.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Palmet described the various unearthly characters he had inspected in
      their dens: Carpendike, Tripehallow, and the radicals Peter Molyneux and
      Samuel Killick, and the ex-member for the borough, Cougham, posing to suit
      sign-boards of Liberal inns, with a hand thrust in his waistcoat, and his
      head well up, the eyes running over the under-lids, after the traditional
      style of our aristocracy; but perhaps more closely resembling an urchin on
      tiptoe peering above park-palings. Cougham&rsquo;s remark to Beauchamp, heard
      and repeated by Palmet with the object of giving an example of the senior
      Liberal&rsquo;s phraseology: &lsquo;I was necessitated to vacate my town mansion, to
      my material discomfort and that of my wife, whose equipage I have been
      compelled to take, by your premature canvass of the borough, Captain
      Beauchamp: and now, I hear, on undeniable authority, that no second
      opponent to us will be forthcoming&rsquo;&mdash;-this produced the greatest
      effect on the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But do you tell me,&rsquo; said Mr. Lespel, when the shouts of the gentlemen
      were subsiding, &lsquo;do you tell me that young Beauchamp is going ahead?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That he is. They flock to him in the street.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He stands there, then, and jingles a money-bag.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet resumed his mimicry of Beauchamp: &lsquo;Not a stiver; purity of election
      is the first condition of instruction to the people! Principles! Then
      they&rsquo;ve got a capital orator: Turbot, an Irishman. I went to a meeting
      last night, and heard him; never heard anything finer in my life. You may
      laugh he whipped me off my legs; fellow spun me like a top; and while he
      was orationing, a donkey calls, &ldquo;Turbot! ain&rsquo;t you a flat fish?&rdquo; and he
      swings round, &ldquo;Not for a fool&rsquo;s hook!&rdquo; and out they hustled the villain
      for a Tory. I never saw anything like it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That repartee wouldn&rsquo;t have done with a Dutchman or a Torbay trawler,&rsquo; 
      said Stukely Culbrett. &lsquo;But let us hear more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it fair?&rsquo; Miss Halkett murmured anxiously to Mrs. Lespel, who returned
      a flitting shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Charming women follow Beauchamp, you know,&rsquo; Palmet proceeded, as he
      conceived, to confirm and heighten the tale of success. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a Miss
      Denham, niece of a doctor, a Dr.... Shot&mdash;Shrapnel! a wonderfully
      good-looking, clever-looking girl, comes across him in half-a-dozen
      streets to ask how he&rsquo;s getting on, and goes every night to his meetings,
      with a man who &lsquo;s a writer and has a mad wife; a man named Lydia-no,
      that&rsquo;s a woman&mdash;Lydiard. It&rsquo;s rather a jumble; but you should see her
      when Beauchamp&rsquo;s on his legs and speaking.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Lydiard is in Bevisham?&rsquo; Mrs. Wardour-Devereux remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know the girl,&rsquo; growled Mr. Lespel. &lsquo;She comes with that rascally
      doctor and a bobtail of tea-drinking men and women and their brats to
      Northeden Heath&mdash;my ground. There they stand and sing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hymns?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Culbrett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what they sing. And when it rains they take the liberty to
      step over my bank into my plantation. Some day I shall have them stepping
      into my house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s Mr. Lydiard; I&rsquo;m sure of the man&rsquo;s name,&rsquo; Palmet replied to
      Mrs. Wardour-Devereux.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We met him in Spain the year before last,&rsquo; she observed to Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &lsquo;we&rsquo; reminded Palmet that her husband was present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Devereux, I didn&rsquo;t see you,&rsquo; he nodded obliquely down the table. &lsquo;By
      the way, what&rsquo;s the grand procession? I hear my man Davis has come all
      right, and I caught sight of the top of your coach-box in the stableyard
      as I came in. What are we up to?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Baskelett writes, it&rsquo;s to be for to-morrow morning at ten-the start.&rsquo; Mr.
      Wardour-Devereux addressed the table generally. He was a fair, huge,
      bush-bearded man, with a voice of unvarying bass: a squire in his county,
      and energetic in his pursuit of the pleasures of hunting, driving,
      travelling, and tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old Bask&rsquo;s the captain of us? Very well, but where do we drive the teams?
      How many are we? What&rsquo;s in hand?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia threw a hurried glance at her hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily some witling said, &lsquo;Fours-in-hand!&rsquo; and so dryly that it passed
      for humour, and gave Mrs. Lespel time to interpose. &lsquo;You are not to know
      till to-morrow, Ernest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet had traced the authorship of the sally to Mr. Algy Borolick, and
      crowned him with praise for it. He asked, &lsquo;Why not know till to-morrow?&rsquo; A
      word in a murmur from Mr. Culbrett, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t frighten the women,&rsquo; satisfied
      him, though why it should he could not have imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lespel quitted the breakfast-table before the setting in of the
      dangerous five minutes of conversation over its ruins, and spoke to her
      husband, who contested the necessity for secresy, but yielded to her
      judgement when it was backed by Stukely Culbrett. Soon after Lord Palmet
      found himself encountered by evasions and witticisms, in spite of the
      absence of the ladies, upon every attempt he made to get some light
      regarding the destination of the four-in-hands next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you going to do?&rsquo; he said to Mr. Devereux, thinking him the
      likeliest one to grow confidential in private.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Smoke,&rsquo; resounded from the depths of that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet recollected the ground of division between the beautiful brunette
      and her lord&mdash;his addiction to the pipe in perpetuity, and deemed it
      sweeter to be with the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      She and Miss Halkett were walking in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Halkett said to him: &lsquo;How wrong of you to betray the secrets of your
      friend! Is he really making way?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beauchamp will head the poll to a certainty,&rsquo; Palmet replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Still,&rsquo; said Miss Halkett, &lsquo;you should not forget that you are not in the
      house of a Liberal. Did you canvass in the town or the suburbs?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everywhere. I assure you, Miss Halkett, there&rsquo;s a feeling for Beauchamp&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      in love with him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He promises them everything, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not he. And the odd thing is, it isn&rsquo;t the Radicals he catches. He won&rsquo;t
      go against the game laws for them, and he won&rsquo;t cut down army and navy. So
      the Radicals yell at him. One confessed he had sold his vote for five
      pounds last election: &ldquo;you shall have it for the same,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;for
      you&rsquo;re all humbugs.&rdquo; Beauchamp took him by the throat and shook him&mdash;metaphorically,
      you know. But as for the tradesmen, he&rsquo;s their hero; bakers especially.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Austin may be right, then!&rsquo; Cecilia reflected aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to Mrs. Lespel to repeat what she had extracted from Palmet,
      after warning the latter not, in common loyalty, to converse about his
      canvass with Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you speak of Mr. Lydiard as Captain Beauchamp&rsquo;s friend?&rsquo; Mrs.
      Devereux inquired of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lydiard? why, he was the man who made off with that pretty Miss Denham,&rsquo; 
      said Palmet. &lsquo;I have the greatest trouble to remember them all; but it was
      not a day wasted. Now I know politics. Shall we ride or walk? You will let
      me have the happiness? I&rsquo;m so unlucky; I rarely meet you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will bring Captain Beauchamp to me the moment he comes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll bring him. Bring him? Nevil Beauchamp won&rsquo;t want bringing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Devereux smiled with some pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grancey Lespel, followed at some distance by Mr. Ferbrass, the Tory
      lawyer, stepped quickly up to Palmet, and asked whether Beauchamp had seen
      Dollikins, the brewer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet could recollect the name of one Tomlinson, and also the calling at
      a brewery. Moreover, Beauchamp had uttered contempt of the brewer&rsquo;s
      business, and of the social rule to accept rich brewers for gentlemen. The
      man&rsquo;s name might be Dollikins and not Tomlinson, and if so, it was
      Dollikins who would not see Beauchamp. To preserve his political
      importance, Palmet said, &lsquo;Dollikins! to be sure, that was the man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Treats him as he does you,&rsquo; Mr. Lespel turned to Ferbrass. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve sent to
      Dollikins to come to me this morning, if he&rsquo;s not driving into the town.
      I&rsquo;ll have him before Beauchamp sees him. I&rsquo;ve asked half-a-dozen of these
      country gentlemen-tradesmen to lunch at my table to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, sir,&rsquo; observed Ferbrass, &lsquo;if they are men to be persuaded, they had
      better not see me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True; they&rsquo;re my old supporters, and mightn&rsquo;t like your Tory face,&rsquo; Mr.
      Lespel assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ferbrass congratulated him on the heartiness of his espousal of the
      Tory cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lespel winced a little, and told him not to put his trust in that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Turned Tory?&rsquo; said Palmet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lespel declined to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet said to Mrs. Devereux, &lsquo;He thinks I&rsquo;m not worth speaking to upon
      politics. Now I&rsquo;ll give him some Beauchamp; I learned lots yesterday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then let it be in Captain Beauchamp&rsquo;s manner,&rsquo; said she softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet obeyed her commands with the liveliest exhibition of his peculiar
      faculty: Cecilia, rejoining them, seemed to hear Nevil himself in his
      emphatic political mood. &lsquo;Because the Whigs are defunct! They had no root
      in the people! Whig is the name of a tribe that was! You have Tory,
      Liberal, and Radical. There is no place for Whig. He is played out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who has been putting that nonsense into your head?&rsquo; Mr. Lespel retorted.
      &lsquo;Go shooting, go shooting!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shots were heard in the woods. Palmet pricked up his ears; but he was
      taken out riding to act cavalier to Mrs. Devereux and Miss Halkett.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia corrected his enthusiasm with the situation. &lsquo;No flatteries
      to-day. There are hours when women feel their insignificance and
      helplessness. I begin to fear for Mr. Austin; and I find I can do nothing
      to aid him. My hands are tied. And yet I know I could win voters if only
      it were permissible for me to go and speak to them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Win them!&rsquo; cried Palmet, imagining the alacrity of men&rsquo;s votes to be won
      by her. He recommended a gallop for the chasing away of melancholy, and as
      they were on the Bevisham high road, which was bordered by strips of turf
      and heath, a few good stretches brought them on the fir-heights,
      commanding views of the town and broad water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I cannot enjoy it,&rsquo; Cecilia said to Mrs. Devereux; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind the
      grey light; cloud and water, and halftones of colour, are homely English
      and pleasant, and that opal where the sun should be has a suggestiveness
      richer than sunlight. I&rsquo;m quite northern enough to understand it; but with
      me it must be either peace or strife, and that Election down there
      destroys my chance of peace. I never could mix reverie with excitement;
      the battle must be over first, and the dead buried. Can you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Devereux answered: &lsquo;Excitement? I am not sure that I know what it is.
      An Election does not excite me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s Nevil Beauchamp himself!&rsquo; Palmet sang out, and the ladies
      discerned Beauchamp under a fir-tree, down by the road, not alone. A man,
      increasing in length like a telescope gradually reaching its end for
      observation, and coming to the height of a landmark, as if raised by
      ropes, was rising from the ground beside him. &lsquo;Shall we trot on, Miss
      Halkett?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia said, &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now I see a third fellow,&rsquo; said Palmet. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the other fellow, the
      Denham-Shrapnel-Radical meeting... Lydiard&rsquo;s his name: writes books!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We may as well ride on,&rsquo; Mrs. Devereux remarked, and her horse fretted
      singularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp perceived them, and lifted his hat. Palmet made demonstrations
      for the ladies. Still neither party moved nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some waiting, Cecilia proposed to turn back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Devereux looked into her eyes. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take the lead,&rsquo; she said, and
      started forward, pursued by Palmet. Cecilia followed at a sullen canter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they came up to Beauchamp, the long-shanked man had stalked away
      townward. Lydiard held Beauchamp by the hand. Some last words, after the
      manner of instructions, passed between them, and then Lydiard also turned
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say, Beauchamp, Mrs. Devereux wants to hear who that man is,&rsquo; Palmet
      said, drawing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That man is Dr. Shrapnel,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, convinced that Cecilia had
      checked her horse at the sight of the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dr. Shrapnel,&rsquo; Palmet informed Mrs. Devereux.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him to seek his wits, and returning Beauchamp&rsquo;s admiring
      salutation with a little bow and smile, said, &lsquo;I fancied it was a
      gentleman we met in Spain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He writes books,&rsquo; observed Palmet, to jog a slow intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pamphlets, you mean.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think he is not a pamphleteer&rsquo;, Mrs. Devereux said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Lydiard, then, of course; how silly I am! How can you pardon me!&rsquo; 
      Beauchamp was contrite; he could not explain that a long guess he had made
      at Miss Halkett&rsquo;s reluctance to come up to him when Dr. Shrapnel was with
      him had preoccupied his mind. He sent off Palmet the bearer of a pretext
      for bringing Lydiard back, and then said to Cecilia, &lsquo;You recognized Dr.
      Shrapnel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought it might be Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;, she was candid enough to reply. &lsquo;I
      could not well recognize him, not knowing him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here comes Mr. Lydiard; and let me assure you, if I may take the liberty
      of introducing him, he is no true Radical. He is a philosopher&mdash;one
      of the flirts, the butterflies of politics, as Dr. Shrapnel calls them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp hummed over some improvized trifles to Lydiard, then introduced
      him cursorily, and all walked in the direction of Itchincope. It was
      really the Mr. Lydiard Mrs. Devereux had met in Spain, so they were left
      in the rear to discuss their travels. Much conversation did not go on in
      front. Cecilia was very reserved. By-and-by she said, &lsquo;I am glad you have
      come into the country early to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke rapturously of the fresh air, and not too mildly of his pleasure
      in meeting her. Quite off her guard, she began to hope he was getting to
      be one of them again, until she heard him tell Lord Palmet that he had
      come early out of Bevisham for the walk with Dr. Shrapnel, and to call on
      certain rich tradesmen living near Itchincope. He mentioned the name of
      Dollikins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dollikins?&rsquo; Palmet consulted a perturbed recollection. Among the
      entangled list of new names he had gathered recently from the study of
      politics, Dollikins rang in his head. He shouted, &lsquo;Yes, Dollikins! to be
      sure. Lespel has him to lunch to-day;&mdash;calls him a
      gentleman-tradesman; odd fish! and told a fellow called&mdash;where is it
      now?&mdash;a name like brass or copper... Copperstone? Brasspot?... told
      him he&rsquo;d do well to keep his Tory cheek out of sight. It &lsquo;s the names of
      those fellows bother one so! All the rest&rsquo;s easy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are evidently in a state of confusion, Lord Palmet,&rsquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone of rebuke and admonishment was unperceived. &lsquo;Not about the
      facts,&rsquo; he rejoined. &lsquo;I &lsquo;m for fair play all round; no trickery. I tell
      Beauchamp all I know, just as I told you this morning, Miss Halkett. What
      I don&rsquo;t like is Lespel turning Tory.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia put a stop to his indiscretions by halting for Mrs. Devereux, and
      saying to Beauchamp, &lsquo;If your friend would return to Bevisham by rail,
      this is the nearest point to the station.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet, best-natured of men, though generally prompted by some of his
      peculiar motives, dismounted from his horse, leaving him to Beauchamp,
      that he might conduct Mr. Lydiard to the station, and perhaps hear a word
      of Miss Denham: at any rate be able to form a guess as to the secret of
      that art of his, which had in the space of an hour restored a happy and
      luminous vivacity to the languid Mrs. Wardour-Devereux.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. THE QUESTION AS TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE WHIGS, AND THE
    </h2>
    <p>
      FINE BLOW STRUCK BY MR. EVERARD ROMFREY
    </p>
    <p>
      Itchincope was famous for its hospitality. Yet Beauchamp, when in the
      presence of his hostess, could see that he was both unexpected and
      unwelcome. Mrs. Lespel was unable to conceal it; she looked meaningly at
      Cecilia, talked of the house being very full, and her husband engaged till
      late in the afternoon. And Captain Baskelett had arrived on a sudden, she
      said. And the luncheon-table in the dining-room could not possibly hold
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We three will sit in the library, anywhere,&rsquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they sat and lunched in the library, where Mrs. Devereux served
      unconsciously for an excellent ally to Cecilia in chatting to Beauchamp,
      principally of the writings of Mr. Lydiard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the blinds of the windows been drawn down and candles lighted,
      Beauchamp would have been well contented to remain with these two ladies,
      and forget the outer world; sweeter society could not have been offered
      him: but glancing carelessly on to the lawn, he exclaimed in some
      wonderment that the man he particularly wished to see was there. &lsquo;It must
      be Dollikins, the brewer. I&rsquo;ve had him pointed out to me in Bevisham, and
      I never can light on him at his brewery.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No excuse for detaining the impetuous candidate struck Cecilia. She betook
      herself to Mrs. Lespel, to give and receive counsel in the emergency,
      while Beauchamp struck across the lawn to Mr. Dollikins, who had the
      squire of Itchincope on the other side of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the afternoon a report reached the ladies of a furious contest
      going on over Dollikins. Mr. Algy Borolick was the first to give them
      intelligence of it, and he declared that Beauchamp had wrested Dollikins
      from Grancey Lespel. This was contradicted subsequently by Mr. Stukely
      Culbrett. &lsquo;But there&rsquo;s heavy pulling between them,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will do all the good in the world to Grancey,&rsquo; said Mrs. Lespel.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat in her little blue-room, with gentlemen congregating at the open
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Grancey Lespel rounded a projection of the house where the
      drawing-room stood out: &lsquo;The maddest folly ever talked!&rsquo; he delivered
      himself in wrath. &lsquo;The Whigs dead? You may as well say I&rsquo;m dead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Beauchamp answering: &lsquo;Politically, you&rsquo;re dead, if you call
      yourself a Whig. You couldn&rsquo;t be a live one, for the party&rsquo;s in pieces,
      blown to the winds. The country was once a chess-board for Whig and Tory:
      but that game&rsquo;s at an end. There&rsquo;s no doubt on earth that the Whigs are
      dead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if there&rsquo;s no doubt about it, how is it I have a doubt about it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know you&rsquo;re a Tory. You tried to get that man Dollikins from me in
      the Tory interest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean to keep him out of Radical clutches. Now that &lsquo;s the truth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They came up to the group by the open window, still conversing hotly,
      indifferent to listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t keep him from me; I have him,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You delude yourself; I have his promise, his pledged word,&rsquo; said Grancey
      Lespel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The man himself told you his opinion of renegade Whigs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Renegade!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Renegade Whig is an actionable phrase,&rsquo; Mr. Culbrett observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t like &ldquo;renegade,&rdquo; take &ldquo;dead,&rdquo;&rsquo; said Beauchamp. &lsquo;Dead Whig
      resurgent in the Tory. You are dead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the stupid conceit of your party thinks that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dead, my dear Mr. Lespel. I&rsquo;ll say for the Whigs, they would not be seen
      touting for Tories if they were not ghosts of Whigs. You are dead. There
      is no doubt of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But,&rsquo; Grancey Lespel repeated, &lsquo;if there&rsquo;s no doubt about it, how is it I
      have a doubt about it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Whigs preached finality in Reform. It was their own funeral sermon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsensical talk!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t dispute your liberty of action to go over to the Tories, but you
      have no right to attempt to take an honest Liberal with you. And that I&rsquo;ve
      stopped.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha! Beauchamp; the man&rsquo;s mine. Come, you&rsquo;ll own he swore he wouldn&rsquo;t
      vote for a Shrapnelite.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember?&mdash;that&rsquo;s how the Tories used to fight you; they
      stuck an epithet to you, and hooted to set the mob an example; you hit
      them off to the life,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, brightening with the fine ire of
      strife, and affecting a sadder indignation. &lsquo;You traded on the ignorance
      of a man prejudiced by lying reports of one of the noblest of human
      creatures.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shrapnel? There! I&rsquo;ve had enough.&rsquo; Grancey Lespel bounced away with both
      hands outspread on the level of his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dead!&rsquo; Beauchamp sent the ghastly accusation after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grancey faced round and said, &lsquo;Bo!&rsquo; which was applauded for a smart
      retort. And let none of us be so exalted above the wit of daily life as to
      sneer at it. Mrs. Lespel remarked to Mr. Culbrett, &lsquo;Do you not see how
      much he is refreshed by the interest he takes in this election? He is ten
      years younger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp bent to her, saying mock-dolefully, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to tell you that
      if ever he was a sincere Whig, he has years of remorse before him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Promise me, Captain Beauchamp,&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;promise you will give us
      no more politics to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If none provoke me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None shall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And as to Bevisham,&rsquo; said Mr. Culbrett, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s the identical borough for a
      Radical candidate, for every voter there demands a division of his
      property, and he should be the last to complain of an adoption of his
      principles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clever,&rsquo; rejoined Beauchamp; &lsquo;but I am under government&rsquo;; and he swept a
      bow to Mrs. Lespel.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were breaking up the group, Captain Baskelett appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! Nevil,&rsquo; said he, passed him, saluted Miss Halkett through the window,
      then cordially squeezed his cousin&rsquo;s hand. &lsquo;Having a holiday out of
      Bevisham? The baron expects to meet you at Mount Laurels to-morrow. He
      particularly wishes me to ask you whether you think all is fair in war.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Nevil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not? The canvass goes on swimmingly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ask Palmet!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Palmet gives you two-thirds of the borough. The poor old Tory tortoise is
      nowhere. They&rsquo;ve been writing about you, Nevil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They have. And if there &lsquo;s a man of honour in the party I shall hold him
      responsible for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I allude to an article in the Bevisham Liberal paper; a magnificent
      eulogy, upon my honour. I give you my word, I have rarely read an article
      so eloquent. And what is the Conservative misdemeanour which the man of
      honour in the party is to pay for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to you about it by-and-by,&rsquo; said Nevil.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to Cecilia too trusting, too simple, considering his cousin&rsquo;s
      undisguised tone of banter. Yet she could not put him on his guard. She
      would have had Mr. Culbrett do so. She walked on the terrace with him near
      upon sunset, and said, &lsquo;The position Captain Beauchamp is in here is most
      unfair to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing unfair in the lion&rsquo;s den,&rsquo; said Stukely Culbrett; adding,
      &lsquo;Now, observe, Miss Halkett; he talks for effect. He discovers that Lespel
      is a Torified Whig; but that does not make him a bit more alert. It&rsquo;s to
      say smart things. He speaks, but won&rsquo;t act, as if he were among enemies.
      He&rsquo;s getting too fond of his bow-wow. Here he is, and he knows the den,
      and he chooses to act the innocent. You see how ridiculous? That trick of
      the ingenu, or peculiarly heavenly messenger, who pretends that he ought
      never to have any harm done to him, though he carries the lighted match,
      is the way of young Radicals. Otherwise Beauchamp would be a dear boy. We
      shall see how he takes his thrashing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You feel sure he will be beaten?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has too strong a dose of fool&rsquo;s honesty to succeed&mdash;stands for
      the game laws with Radicals, for example. He&rsquo;s loaded with scruples and
      crotchets, and thinks more of them than of his winds and his tides. No
      public man is to be made out of that. His idea of the Whigs being dead
      shows a head that can&rsquo;t read the country. He means himself for mankind,
      and is preparing to be the benefactor of a country parish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But as a naval officer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excellent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was convinced that Mr. Culbrett underestimated Beauchamp.
      Nevertheless the confidence expressed in Beauchamp&rsquo;s defeat reassured and
      pleased her. At midnight she was dancing with him in the midst of great
      matronly country vessels that raised a wind when they launched on the
      waltz, and exacted an anxious pilotage on the part of gentlemen careful of
      their partners; and why I cannot say, but contrasts produce quaint ideas
      in excited spirits, and a dancing politician appeared to her so absurd
      that at one moment she had to bite her lips not to laugh. It will hardly
      be credited that the waltz with Nevil was delightful to Cecilia all the
      while, and dancing with others a penance. He danced with none other. He
      led her to a three o&rsquo;clock morning supper: one of those triumphant
      subversions of the laws and customs of earth which have the charm of a
      form of present deification for all young people; and she, while noting
      how the poor man&rsquo;s advocate dealt with costly pasties and sparkling wines,
      was overjoyed at his hearty comrade&rsquo;s manner with the gentlemen, and a
      leadership in fun that he seemed to have established. Cecil Baskelett
      acknowledged it, and complimented him on it. &lsquo;I give you my word, Nevil, I
      never heard you in finer trim. Here&rsquo;s to our drive into Bevisham
      to-morrow! Do you drink it? I beg; I entreat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, certainly,&rsquo; said Nevil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you take a whip down there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re all insured.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On my honour, old Nevil, driving a four-in-hand is easier than governing
      the country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll accept your authority for what you know best,&rsquo; said Nevil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The toast of the Drive into Bevisham was drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia left the supper-table, mortified, and feeling disgraced by her
      participation in a secret that was being wantonly abused to humiliate
      Nevil, as she was made to think by her sensitiveness. All the gentlemen
      were against him, excepting perhaps that chattering pie Lord Palmet, who
      did him more mischief than his enemies. She could not sleep. She walked
      out on the terrace with Mrs. Wardour-Devereux, in a dream, hearing that
      lady breathe remarks hardly less than sentimental, and an unwearied
      succession of shouts from the smoking-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are not going to bed to-night,&rsquo; said Mrs. Devereux.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are mystifying Captain Beauchamp,&rsquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My husband tells me they are going to drive him into the town to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia flushed: she could scarcely get her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that their plot?&rsquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sleep was rejected by her, bed itself. The drive into Bevisham had been
      fixed for nine A.M. She wrote two lines on note-paper in her room: but
      found them overfervid and mysterious. Besides, how were they to be
      conveyed to Nevil&rsquo;s chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked in the passage for half an hour, thinking it possible she might
      meet him; not the most lady-like of proceedings, but her head was
      bewildered. An arm-chair in her room invited her to rest and think&mdash;the
      mask of a natural desire for sleep. At eight in the morning she was
      awakened by her maid, and at a touch exclaimed, &lsquo;Have they gone?&rsquo; and her
      heart still throbbed after hearing that most of the gentlemen were in and
      about the stables. Cecilia was down-stairs at a quarter to nine. The
      breakfast-room was empty of all but Lord Palmet and Mr. Wardour-Devereux;
      one selecting a cigar to light out of doors, the other debating between
      two pipes. She beckoned to Palmet, and commissioned him to inform
      Beauchamp that she wished him to drive her down to Bevisham in her
      pony-carriage. Palmet brought back word from Beauchamp that he had an
      appointment at ten o&rsquo;clock in the town. &lsquo;I want to see him,&rsquo; she said; so
      Palmet ran out with the order. Cecilia met Beauchamp in the entrance-hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must not go,&rsquo; she said bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t break an appointment,&rsquo; said he&mdash;&lsquo;for the sake of my own
      pleasure,&rsquo; was implied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you not listen to me, Nevil, when I say you cannot go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A coachman&rsquo;s trumpet blew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be late. That&rsquo;s Colonel Millington&rsquo;s team. He starts first, then
      Wardour-Devereux, then Cecil, and I mount beside him; Palmet&rsquo;s at our
      heels.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But can&rsquo;t you even imagine a purpose for their driving into Bevisham so
      pompously?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, men with drags haven&rsquo;t commonly much purpose,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But on this occasion! At an Election time! Surely, Nevil, you can guess
      at a reason.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A second trumpet blew very martially. Footmen came in search of Captain
      Beauchamp. The alternative of breaking her pledged word to her father, or
      of letting Nevil be burlesqued in the sight of the town, could no longer
      be dallied with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia said, &lsquo;Well, Nevil, then you shall hear it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon Captain Baskelett&rsquo;s groom informed Captain Beauchamp that he was
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; Nevil said to Cecilia, &lsquo;tell me on board the yacht.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil, you will be driving into the town with the second Tory candidate
      of the borough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which? who?&rsquo; Nevil &lsquo;asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your cousin Cecil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell Captain Baskelett that I don&rsquo;t drive down till an hour later,&rsquo; Nevil
      said to the groom. &lsquo;Cecilia, you&rsquo;re my friend; I wish you were more. I
      wish we didn&rsquo;t differ. I shall hope to change you&mdash;make you come
      half-way out of that citadel of yours. This is my uncle Everard! I might
      have made sure there&rsquo;d be a blow from him! And Cecil! of all men for a
      politician! Cecilia, think of it! Cecil Baskelett! I beg Seymour Austin&rsquo;s
      pardon for having suspected him...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now sounded Captain Baskelett&rsquo;s trumpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Angry though he was, Beauchamp laughed. &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it exactly like the baron
      to spring a mine of this kind?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was decidedly humour in the plot, and it was a lusty quarterstaff
      blow into the bargain. Beauchamp&rsquo;s head rang with it. He could not conceal
      the stunning effect it had on him. Gratitude and tenderness toward Cecilia
      for saving him, at the cost of a partial breach of faith that he quite
      understood, from the scandal of the public entry into Bevisham on the Tory
      coach-box, alternated with his interjections regarding his uncle Everard.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven, Cecilia sat in her pony-carriage giving final directions to
      Mrs. Devereux where to look out for the Esperanza and the schooner&rsquo;s boat.
      &lsquo;Then I drive down alone,&rsquo; Mrs. Devereux said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen were all off, and every available maid with them on the
      coach-boxes, a brilliant sight that had been missed by Nevil and Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, here&rsquo;s Lydiard!&rsquo; said Nevil, supposing that Lydiard must be
      approaching him with tidings of the second Tory candidate. But Lydiard
      knew nothing of it. He was the bearer of a letter on foreign paper&mdash;marked
      urgent, in Rosamund&rsquo;s hand&mdash;and similarly worded in the well-known
      hand which had inscribed the original address of the letter to Steynham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp opened it and read:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
               Chateau Tourdestelle
                    &lsquo;(Eure).

        &lsquo;Come. I give you three days&mdash;no more.

                    &lsquo;RENEE.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      The brevity was horrible. Did it spring from childish imperiousness or
      tragic peril?
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp could imagine it to be this or that. In moments of excited
      speculation we do not dwell on the possibility that there may be a mixture
      of motives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear I must cross over to France this evening,&rsquo; he said to Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied, &lsquo;It is likely to be stormy to-night. The steamboat may not
      run.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If there&rsquo;s a doubt of it, I shall find a French lugger. You are tired,
      from not sleeping last night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she answered, and nodded to Mrs. Devereux, beside whom Mr. Lydiard
      stood: &lsquo;You will not drive down alone, you see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For a young lady threatened with a tempest in her heart, as disturbing to
      her as the one gathering in the West for ships at sea, Miss Halkett bore
      herself well.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. THE DRIVE INTO BEVISHAM
    </h2>
    <p>
      Beauchamp was requested by Cecilia to hold the reins. His fair companion
      in the pony-carriage preferred to lean back musing, and he had leisure to
      think over the blow dealt him by his uncle Everard with so sure an aim so
      ringingly on the head. And in the first place he made no attempt to
      disdain it because it was nothing but artful and heavy-handed, after the
      mediaeval pattern. Of old he himself had delighted in artfulness as well
      as boldness and the unmistakeable hit. Highly to prize generalship was in
      his blood, though latterly the very forces propelling him to his political
      warfare had forbidden the use of it to him. He saw the patient veteran
      laying his gun for a long shot&mdash;to give as good as he had received;
      and in realizing Everard Romfrey&rsquo;s perfectly placid bearing under
      provocation, such as he certainly would have maintained while preparing
      his reply to it, the raw fighting humour of the plot touched the sense of
      justice in Beauchamp enough to make him own that he had been the first to
      offend.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could reflect also on the likelihood that other offended men of his
      uncle&rsquo;s age and position would have sulked or stormed, threatening the
      Parthian shot of the vindictive testator. If there was godlessness in
      turning to politics for a weapon to strike a domestic blow, manfulness in
      some degree signalized it. Beauchamp could fancy his uncle crying out, Who
      set the example? and he was not at that instant inclined to dwell on the
      occult virtues of the example he had set. To be honest, this elevation of
      a political puppet like Cecil Baskelett, and the starting him, out of the
      same family which Turbot, the journalist, had magnified, into Bevisham
      with such pomp and flourish in opposition to the serious young champion of
      popular rights and the Puritan style, was ludicrously effective.
      Conscienceless of course. But that was the way of the Old School.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp broke the silence by thanking Cecilia once more for saving him
      from the absurd exhibition of the Radical candidate on the Tory coach-box,
      and laughing at the grimmish slyness of his uncle Everard&rsquo;s conspiracy a
      something in it that was half-smile half-sneer; not exactly malignant, and
      by no means innocent; something made up of the simplicity of a lighted
      match, and its proximity to powder, yet neither deadly, in spite of a
      wicked twinkle, nor at all pretending to be harmless: in short, a specimen
      of old English practical humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laboured to express these or corresponding views of it, with tolerably
      natural laughter, and Cecilia rallied her spirits at his pleasant manner
      of taking his blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall compliment the baron when I meet him tonight,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;What can
      we compare him to?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She suggested the Commander of the Faithful, the Lord Haroun, who likewise
      had a turn for buffooneries to serve a purpose, and could direct them
      loftily and sovereignty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No: Everard Romfrey&rsquo;s a Northerner from the feet up,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia compliantly offered him a sketch of the Scandinavian Troll: much
      nearer the mark, he thought, and exclaimed: &lsquo;Baron Troll! I&rsquo;m afraid,
      Cecilia, you have robbed him of the best part of his fun. And you will owe
      it entirely to him if you should be represented in Parliament by my cousin
      Basketett.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Promise me, Nevit, that you will, when you meet Captain Baskelett, not
      forget I did you some service, and that I wish, I shall be so glad if you
      do not resent certain things.... Very objectionable, we all think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He released her from the embarrassing petition: &lsquo;Oh! now I know my man,
      you may be sure I won&rsquo;t waste a word on him. The fact is, he would not
      understand a word, and would require more&mdash;and that I don&rsquo;t do. When
      I fancied Mr. Austin was the responsible person, I meant to speak to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia smiled gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sweetness of a love-speech would not have been sweeter to her than
      this proof of civilized chivalry in Nevil.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came to the fir-heights overlooking Bevisham. Here the breezy
      beginning of a South-western autumnal gale tossed the ponies&rsquo; manes and
      made threads of Cecilia&rsquo;s shorter locks of beautiful auburn by the temples
      and the neck, blustering the curls that streamed in a thick involution
      from the silken band gathering them off her uncovered clear-swept ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp took an impression of her side face. It seemed to offer him
      everything the world could offer of cultivated purity, intelligent beauty
      and attractiveness; and &lsquo;Wilt thou?&rsquo; said the winged minute. Peace, a good
      repute in the mouths of men, home, and a trustworthy woman for mate, an
      ideal English lady, the rarest growth of our country, and friends and fair
      esteem, were offered. Last night he had waltzed with her, and the manner
      of this tall graceful girl in submitting to the union of the measure and
      reserving her individual distinction, had exquisitely flattered his taste,
      giving him an auspicious image of her in partnership, through the uses of
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked ahead at the low dead-blue cloud swinging from across channel.
      What could be the riddle of Renee&rsquo;s letter! It chained him completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At all events, I shall not be away longer than three days,&rsquo; he said;
      paused, eyed Cecilia&rsquo;s profile, and added, &lsquo;Do we differ so much?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It may not be so much as we think,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if we do!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, Nevil, there is a difference between us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if we keep our lips closed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We should have to shut our eyes as well!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A lovely melting image of her stole over him; all the warmer for her
      unwittingness in producing it: and it awakened a tenderness toward the
      simple speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia&rsquo;s delicate breeding saved her from running on figuratively. She
      continued: &lsquo;Intellectual differences do not cause wounds, except when very
      unintellectual sentiments are behind them:&mdash;my conceit, or your
      impatience, Nevil? &ldquo;Noi veggiam come quei, che ha mala luce.&rdquo;... I can
      confess my sight to be imperfect: but will you ever do so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her musical voice in Italian charmed his hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What poet was that you quoted?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wisest: Dante.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s favourite! I must try to read him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He reads Dante?&rsquo; Cecilia threw a stress on the august name; and it was
      manifest that she cared not for the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contemptuous exclusiveness could not go farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a man of cultivation,&rsquo; Beauchamp said cursorily, trying to avoid
      dissension, but in vain. &lsquo;I wish I were half as well instructed, and the
      world half as charitable as he!&mdash;You ask me if I shall admit my sight
      to be imperfect. Yes; when you prove to me that priests and landlords are
      willing to do their duty by the people in preference to their churches and
      their property: but will you ever shake off prejudice?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was opposition sounding again. Cecilia mentally reproached Dr.
      Shrapnel for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, Nevil, really, must not&mdash;may I not ask you this?&mdash;must
      not every one feel the evil spell of some associations? And Dante and Dr.
      Shrapnel!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know him, Cecilia.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I saw him yesterday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You thought him too tall?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought of his character.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How angry I should be with you if you were not so beautiful!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am immensely indebted to my unconscious advocate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are clad in steel; you flash back; you won&rsquo;t answer me out of the
      heart. I &lsquo;m convinced it is pure wilfulness that makes you oppose me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fancy you must be convinced because you cannot imagine women to have
      any share of public spirit, Nevil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A grain of truth in that remark set Nevil reflecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want them to have it,&rsquo; he remarked, and glanced at a Tory placard,
      probably the puppet&rsquo;s fresh-printed address to the electors, on one of the
      wayside fir-trees. &lsquo;Bevisham looks well from here. We might make a
      North-western Venice of it, if we liked.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa told you it would be money sunk in mud.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did I mention it to him?&mdash;Thoroughly Conservative!&mdash;So he would
      leave the mud as it is. They insist on our not venturing anything&mdash;those
      Tories! exactly as though we had gained the best of human conditions,
      instead of counting crops of rogues, malefactors, egoists, noxious and
      lumbersome creatures that deaden the country. Your town down there is one
      of the ugliest and dirtiest in the kingdom: it might be the fairest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have often thought that of Bevisham, Nevil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew a visionary sketch of quays, embankments, bridged islands, public
      buildings, magical emanations of patriotic architecture, with a practical
      air, an absence of that enthusiasm which struck her with suspicion when it
      was not applied to landscape or the Arts; and she accepted it, and warmed,
      and even allowed herself to appear hesitating when he returned to the
      similarity of the state of mud-begirt Bevisham and our great sluggish
      England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he not perhaps to be pitied in his bondage to the Frenchwoman, who
      could have no ideas in common with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      The rare circumstance that she and Nevil Beauchamp had found a subject of
      agreement, partially overcame the sentiment Cecilia entertained for the
      foreign lady; and having now one idea in common with him, she conceived
      the possibility that there might be more. There must be many, for he loved
      England, and she no less. She clung, however, to the topic of Bevisham,
      preferring to dream of the many more, rather than run risks. Undoubtedly
      the town was of an ignoble aspect; and it was declining in prosperity; and
      it was consequently over-populated. And undoubtedly (so she was induced to
      coincide for the moment) a Government, acting to any extent like a
      supervising head, should aid and direct the energies of towns and ports
      and trades, and not leave everything everywhere to chance: schools for the
      people, public morality, should be the charge of Government. Cecilia had
      surrendered the lead to him, and was forced to subscribe to an equivalent
      of &lsquo;undoubtedly&rsquo; the Tories just as little as the Liberals had done these
      good offices. Party against party, neither of them had a forethoughtful
      head for the land at large. They waited for the Press to spur a great
      imperial country to be but defensively armed, and they accepted the
      so-called volunteers, with a nominal one-month&rsquo;s drill per annum, as a
      guarantee of defence!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp startled her, actually kindled her mind to an activity of wonder
      and regret, with the statement of how much Government, acting with some
      degree of farsightedness, might have won to pay the public debt and remit
      taxation, by originally retaining the lines of railway, and fastening on
      the valuable land adjoining stations. Hundreds of millions of pounds!
    </p>
    <p>
      She dropped a sigh at the prodigious amount, but inquired, &lsquo;Who has
      calculated it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For though perfectly aware that this kind of conversation was a special
      compliment paid to her by her friend Nevil, and dimly perceiving that it
      implied something beyond a compliment-in fact, that it was his manner of
      probing her for sympathy, as other men would have conducted the process
      preliminary to deadly flattery or to wooing, her wits fenced her heart
      about; the exercise of shrewdness was an instinct of self-preservation.
      She had nothing but her poor wits, daily growing fainter, to resist him
      with. And he seemed to know it, and therefore assailed them, never trying
      at the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      That vast army of figures might be but a phantom army conjured out of the
      Radical mists, might it not? she hinted. And besides, we cannot surely
      require a Government to speculate in the future, can we?
    </p>
    <p>
      Possibly not, as Governments go, Beauchamp said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what think you of a Government of landowners decreeing the enclosure
      of millions of acres of common land amongst themselves; taking the
      property of the people to add to their own! Say, is not that plunder?
      Public property, observe; decreed to them by their own law-making, under
      the pretence that it was being reclaimed for cultivation, when in reality
      it has been but an addition to their pleasure-grounds: a flat robbery of
      pasture from the poor man&rsquo;s cow and goose, and his right of cutting furze
      for firing. Consider that! Beauchamp&rsquo;s eyes flashed democratic in reciting
      this injury to the objects of his warm solicitude&mdash;the man, the cow,
      and the goose. But so must he have looked when fronting England&rsquo;s enemies,
      and his aspect of fervour subdued Cecilia. She confessed her inability to
      form an estimate of such conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are they doing it still?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We owe it to Dr. Shrapnel foremost that there is now a watch over them to
      stop them. But for him, Grancey Lespel would have enclosed half of
      Northeden Heath. As it is, he has filched bits here and there, and he will
      have to put back his palings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, now let Cecilia understand that we English, calling ourselves
      free, are under morally lawless rule. Government is what we require, and
      our means of getting it must be through universal suffrage. At present we
      have no Government; only shifting Party Ministries, which are the tools of
      divers interests, wealthy factions, to the sacrifice of the Commonwealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She listened, like Rosamund Culling overborne by Dr. Shrapnel, inwardly
      praying that she might discover a man to reply to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A Despotism, Nevil?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He hoped not, declined the despot, was English enough to stand against the
      best of men in that character; but he cast it on Tory, Whig, and Liberal,
      otherwise the Constitutionalists, if we were to come upon the despot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They see we are close on universal suffrage; they&rsquo;ve been bidding each in
      turn for &ldquo;the people,&rdquo; and that has brought them to it, and now they&rsquo;re
      alarmed, and accuse one another of treason to the Constitution, and they
      don&rsquo;t accept the situation: and there&rsquo;s a fear, that to carry on their
      present system, they will be thwarting the people or corrupting them: and
      in that case we shall have our despot in some shape or other, and we shall
      suffer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil,&rsquo; said Cecilia, &lsquo;I am out of my depth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll support you; I can swim for two,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are very self-confident, but I find I am not fit for battle; at least
      not in the front ranks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nerve me, then: will you? Try to comprehend once for all what the battle
      is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid I am too indifferent; I am too luxurious. That reminds me:
      you want to meet your uncle Everard and if you will sleep at Mount Laurels
      to-night, the Esperanza shall take you to France to-morrow morning, and
      can wait to bring you back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she perceived a flush mounting over Nevil&rsquo;s face. Soon it was
      communicated to hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strange secret of the blood electrified them both, and revealed the
      burning undercurrent running between them from the hearts of each. The
      light that showed how near they were to one another was kindled at the
      barrier dividing them. It remained as good as a secret, unchallenged until
      they had separated, and after midnight Cecilia looked through her chamber
      windows at the driving moon of a hurricane scud, and read clearly his
      honourable reluctance to be wafted over to his French love by her
      assistance; and Beauchamp on board the tossing steamboat perceived in her
      sympathetic reddening that she had divined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This auroral light eclipsed the other events of the day. He drove into a
      town royally decorated, and still humming with the ravishment of the Tory
      entrance. He sailed in the schooner to Mount Laurels, in the society of
      Captain Baskelett and his friends, who, finding him tamer than they
      expected, bantered him in the cheerfullest fashion. He waited for his
      uncle Everard several hours at Mount Laurels, perused the junior Tory&rsquo;s
      address to the Electors, throughout which there was not an idea&mdash;safest
      of addresses to canvass upon! perused likewise, at Captain Baskelett&rsquo;s
      request, a broad sheet of an article introducing the new candidate to
      Bevisham with the battle-axe Romfreys to back him, in high burlesque of
      Timothy Turbot upon Beauchamp: and Cecil hoped his cousin would not object
      to his borrowing a Romfrey or two for so pressing an occasion. All very
      funny, and no doubt the presence of Mr. Everard Romfrey would have
      heightened the fun from the fountain-head; but he happened to be delayed,
      and Beauchamp had to leave directions behind him in the town, besides the
      discussion of a whole plan of conduct with Dr. Shrapnel, so he was under
      the necessity of departing without seeing his uncle, really to his regret.
      He left word to that effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking leave of Cecilia, he talked of his return &lsquo;home&rsquo; within three or
      four days as a certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: &lsquo;Canvassing should not be neglected now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hostility was confused by what she had done to save him from
      annoyance, while his behaviour to his cousin Cecil increased her respect
      for him. She detected a pathetic meaning in his mention of the word home;
      she mused on his having called her beautiful: whither was she hurrying?
      Forgetful of her horror of his revolutionary ideas, forgetful of the
      elevation of her own, she thrilled secretly on hearing it stated by the
      jubilant young Tories at Mount Laurels, as a characteristic of Beauchamp,
      that he was clever in parrying political thrusts, and slipping from the
      theme; he who with her gave out unguardedly the thoughts deepest in him.
      And the thoughts!&mdash;were they not of generous origin? Where so true a
      helpmate for him as the one to whom his mind appealed? It could not be so
      with the Frenchwoman. Cecilia divined a generous nature by generosity, and
      set herself to believe that in honour he had not yet dared to speak to her
      from the heart, not being at heart quite free. She was at the same time in
      her remains of pride cool enough to examine and rebuke the weakness she
      succumbed to in now clinging to him by that which yesterday she hardly
      less than loathed, still deeply disliked.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. TOURDESTELLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the part of Beauchamp, his conversation with Cecilia during the drive
      into Bevisham opened out for the first time in his life a prospect of
      home; he had felt the word in speaking it, and it signified an end to the
      distractions produced by the sex, allegiance to one beloved respected
      woman, and also a basis of operations against the world. For she was
      evidently conquerable, and once matched with him would be the very woman
      to nerve and sustain him. Did she not listen to him? He liked her
      resistance. That element of the barbarous which went largely to form his
      emotional nature was overjoyed in wresting such a woman from the enemy,
      and subduing her personally. She was a prize. She was a splendid prize,
      cut out from under the guns of the fort. He rendered all that was due to
      his eminently good cause for its part in so signal a success, but
      individual satisfaction is not diminished by the thought that the
      individual&rsquo;s discernment selected the cause thus beneficent to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp&rsquo;s meditations were diverted by the sight of the coast of France
      dashed in rain-lines across a weed-strewn sea. The &lsquo;three days&rsquo; granted
      him by Renee were over, and it scarcely troubled him that he should be
      behind the time; he detested mystery, holding it to be a sign of
      pretentious feebleness, often of imposture, it might be frivolity.
      Punctilious obedience to the mysterious brevity of the summons, and not to
      chafe at it, appeared to him as much as could be expected of a struggling
      man. This was the state of the case with him, until he stood on French
      earth, breathed French air, and chanced to hear the tongue of France
      twittered by a lady on the quay. The charm was instantaneous. He reminded
      himself that Renee, unlike her countrywomen, had no gift for writing
      letters. They had never corresponded since the hour of her marriage. They
      had met in Sicily, at Syracuse, in the presence of her father and her
      husband, and so inanimate was she that the meeting seemed like the
      conclusion of their history. Her brother Roland sent tidings of her by
      fits, and sometimes a conventional message from Tourdestelle. Latterly her
      husband&rsquo;s name had been cited as among the wildfires of Parisian quays, in
      journals more or less devoted to those unreclaimed spaces of the city.
      Well, if she was unhappy, was it not the fulfilment of his prophecy in
      Venice?
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee&rsquo;s brevity became luminous. She needed him urgently, and knowing him
      faithful to the death, she, because she knew him, dispatched purely the
      words which said she needed him. Why, those brief words were the poetry of
      noble confidence! But what could her distress be? The lover was able to
      read that, &lsquo;Come; I give you three days,&rsquo; addressed to him, was not
      language of a woman free of her yoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excited to guess and guess, Beauchamp swept on to speculations of a
      madness that seized him bodily at last. Were you loved, Cecilia? He
      thought little of politics in relation to Renee; or of home, or of honour
      in the world&rsquo;s eye, or of labouring to pay the fee for his share of life.
      This at least was one of the forms of love which precipitate men: the sole
      thought in him was to be with her. She was Renee, the girl of whom he had
      prophetically said that she must come to regrets and tears. His vision of
      her was not at Tourdestelle, though he assumed her to be there awaiting
      him: she was under the sea-shadowing Alps, looking up to the red and
      gold-rosed heights of a realm of morning that was hers inviolably, and
      under which Renee was eternally his.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interval between then and now was but the space of an unquiet sea
      traversed in the night, sad in the passage of it, but featureless&mdash;and
      it had proved him right! It was to Nevil Beauchamp as if the spirit of his
      old passion woke up again to glorious hopeful morning when he stood in
      Renee&rsquo;s France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tourdestelle enjoyed the aristocratic privilege of being twelve miles from
      the nearest railway station. Alighting here on an evening of clear sky,
      Beauchamp found an English groom ready to dismount for him and bring on
      his portmanteau. The man said that his mistress had been twice to the
      station, and was now at the neighbouring Chateau Dianet. Thither Beauchamp
      betook himself on horseback. He was informed at the gates that Madame la
      Marquise had left for Tourdestelle in the saddle only ten minutes
      previously. The lodge-keeper had been instructed to invite him to stay at
      Chateau Dianet in the event of his arriving late, but it would be possible
      to overtake madame by a cut across the heights at a turn of the valley.
      Beauchamp pushed along the valley for this visible projection; a towering
      mass of woodland, in the midst of which a narrow roadway, worn like the
      track of a torrent with heavy rain, wound upward. On his descent to the
      farther side, he was to spy directly below in the flat for Tourdestelle.
      He crossed the wooded neck above the valley, and began descending, peering
      into gulfs of the twilight dusk. Some paces down he was aided by a
      brilliant half-moon that divided the whole underlying country into sharp
      outlines of dark and fair, and while endeavouring to distinguish the
      chateau of Tourdestelle his eyes were attracted to an angle of the
      downward zigzag, where a pair of horses emerged into broad light swiftly;
      apparently the riders were disputing, or one had overtaken the other in
      pursuit. Riding-habit and plumed hat signalized the sex of one. Beauchamp
      sung out a gondolier&rsquo;s cry. He fancied it was answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was heard, for the lady turned about, and as he rode down, still
      uncertain of her, she came cantering up alone, and there could be no
      uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moonlight is friendless to eyes that would make sure of a face long
      unseen. It was Renee whose hand he clasped, but the story of the years on
      her, and whether she was in bloom, or wan as the beams revealing her, he
      could not see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tongue sounded to him as if it were loosened without a voice. &lsquo;You
      have come. That storm! You are safe!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So phantom-like a sound of speech alarmed him. &lsquo;I lost no time. But you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing hangs over you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why give me just three days?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pure impatience. Have you forgotten me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Their horses walked on with them. They unlocked their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You knew it was I?&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who else could it be? I heard Venice,&rsquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her previous cavalier was on his feet, all but on his knees, it appeared,
      searching for something that eluded him under the road-side bank. He
      sprang at it and waved it, leapt in the saddle, and remarked, as he drew
      up beside Renee: &lsquo;What one picks from the earth one may wear, I presume,
      especially when we can protest it is our property.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp saw him planting a white substance most carefully at the breast
      buttonhole of his coat. It could hardly be a flower. Some drooping exotic
      of the conservatory perhaps resembled it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee pronounced his name: &lsquo;M. le Comte Henri d&rsquo;Henriel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed to Beauchamp with an extreme sweep of the hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Last night, M. Beauchamp, we put up vows for you to the Marine God,
      beseeching an exemption from that horrible mal de mer. Thanks to the
      storm, I suppose, I have won. I must maintain, madame, that I won.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wear your trophy,&rsquo; said Renee, and her horse reared and darted ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman on each side of her struck into a trot. Beauchamp glanced at
      M. d&rsquo;Henriel&rsquo;s breast-decoration. Renee pressed the pace, and threading
      dense covers of foliage they reached the level of the valley, where for a
      couple of miles she led them, stretching away merrily, now in shadow, now
      in moonlight, between high land and meadow land, and a line of poplars in
      the meadows winding with the river that fed the vale and shot forth gleams
      of silvery disquiet by rustic bridge and mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strangeness of being beside her, not having yet scanned her face,
      marvelling at her voice&mdash;that was like and unlike the Renee of old,
      full of her, but in another key, a mellow note, maturer&mdash;made the
      ride magical to Beauchamp, planting the past in the present like a
      perceptible ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee slackened speed, saying: &lsquo;Tourdestelle spans a branch of our little
      river. This is our gate. Had it been daylight I would have taken you by
      another way, and you would have seen the black tower burnt in the
      Revolution; an imposing monument, I am assured. However, you will think it
      pretty beside the stream. Do you come with us, M. le Comte?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His answer was inaudible to Beauchamp; he did not quit them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lamp at the lodge-gates presented the young man&rsquo;s face in full view,
      and Beauchamp thought him supremely handsome. He perceived it to be a
      lady&rsquo;s glove that M. d&rsquo;Henriel wore at his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee walked her horse up the park-drive, alongside the bright running
      water. It seemed that she was aware of the method of provoking or
      reproving M. d&rsquo;Henriel. He endured some minutes of total speechlessness at
      this pace, and abruptly said adieu and turned back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee bounded like a vessel free of her load. &lsquo;But why should we hurry?&rsquo; 
      said she, and checked her course to the walk again. &lsquo;I hope you like our
      Normandy, and my valley. You used to love France, Nevil; and Normandy,
      they tell me, is cousin to the opposite coast of England, in climate,
      soil, people, it may be in manners too. A Beauchamp never can feel that he
      is a foreigner in Normandy. We claim you half French. You have grander
      parks, they say. We can give you sunlight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And it was really only the wish to see me?&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only, and really. One does not live for ever&mdash;on earth; and it
      becomes a question whether friends should be shadows to one another before
      death. I wrote to you because I wished to see you: I was impatient because
      I am Renee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You relieve me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Evidently you have forgotten my character, Nevil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a feature of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; she breathed involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you have me forget it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I think by myself, quite alone, yes, I would. Otherwise how can one
      hope that one&rsquo;s friend is friendship, supposing him to read us as we are&mdash;minutely,
      accurately? And it is in absence that we desire our friends to be
      friendship itself. And... and I am utterly astray! I have not dealt in
      this language since I last thought of writing a diary, and stared at the
      first line. If I mistake not, you are fond of the picturesque. If
      moonlight and water will satisfy you, look yonder.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon launched her fairy silver fleets on a double sweep of the little
      river round an island of reeds and two tall poplars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have wondered whether I should ever see you looking at that scene,&rsquo; 
      said Renee.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked from it to her, and asked if Roland was well, and her father;
      then alluded to her husband; but the unlettering elusive moon, bright only
      in the extension of her beams, would not tell him what story this face,
      once heaven to him, wore imprinted on it. Her smile upon a parted mouth
      struck him as two-edged in replying: &lsquo;I have good news to give you of them
      all: Roland is in garrison at Rouen, and will come when I telegraph. My
      father is in Touraine, and greets you affectionately; he hopes to come.
      They are both perfectly happy. My husband is travelling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp was conscious of some bitter taste; unaware of what it was,
      though it led him to say, undesigningly: &lsquo;How very handsome that M.
      d&rsquo;Henriel is!&mdash;if I have his name correctly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee answered: &lsquo;He has the misfortune to be considered the handsomest
      young man in France.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has an Italian look.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His mother was Provencale.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her horse in motion, saying: &lsquo;I agree with you that handsome men
      are rarities. And, by the way, they do not set our world on fire quite as
      much as beautiful women do yours, my friend. Acknowledge so much in our
      favour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He assented indefinitely. He could have wished himself away canvassing in
      Bevisham. He had only to imagine himself away from her, to feel the flood
      of joy in being with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your husband is travelling?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is his pleasure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Could she have intended to say that this was good news to give of him as
      well as of the happiness of her father and brother?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now look on Tourdestelle,&rsquo; said Renee. &lsquo;You will avow that for an active
      man to be condemned to seek repose in so dull a place, after the fatigues
      of the season in Paris, it is considerably worse than for women, so I am
      here to dispense the hospitalities. The right wing of the chateau, on your
      left, is new. The side abutting the river is inhabited by Dame Philiberte,
      whom her husband imprisoned for attempting to take her pleasure in travel.
      I hear upon authority that she dresses in white, and wears a black
      crucifix. She is many centuries old, and still she lives to remind people
      that she married a Rouaillout. Do you not think she should have come to me
      to welcome me? She never has; and possibly of ladies who are disembodied
      we may say that they know best. For me, I desire the interview&mdash;and I
      am a coward: I need not state it.&rsquo; She ceased; presently continuing: &lsquo;The
      other inhabitants are my sister, Agnes d&rsquo;Auffray, wife of a general
      officer serving in Afric&mdash;my sister by marriage, and my friend; the
      baronne d&rsquo;Orbec, a relation by marriage; M. d&rsquo;Orbec, her son, a guest, and
      a sportsman; M. Livret, an erudite. No young ladies: I can bear much, but
      not their presence; girls are odious to me. I knew one in Venice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They came within the rays of the lamp hanging above the unpretending
      entrance to the chateau. Renee&rsquo;s broad grey Longueville hat curved low
      with its black plume on the side farthest from him. He was favoured by the
      gallant lift of the brim on the near side, but she had overshadowed her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He wears a glove at his breast,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You speak of M. d&rsquo;Henriel. He wears a glove at his breast; yes, it is
      mine,&rsquo; said Renee.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slipped from her horse and stood against his shoulder, as if waiting
      to be questioned before she rang the bell of the chateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp alighted, burning with his unutterable questions concerning that
      glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lift your hat, let me beg you; let me see you,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not what she had expected. With one heave of her bosom, and
      murmuring: &lsquo;I made a vow I would obey you absolutely if you came,&rsquo; she
      raised the hat above her brows, and lightning would not have surprised him
      more; for there had not been a single vibration of her voice to tell him
      of tears running: nay, the absence of the usual French formalities in her
      manner of addressing him, had seemed to him to indicate her intention to
      put him at once on an easy friendly footing, such as would be natural to
      her, and not painful to him. Now she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You perceive, monsieur, that I have my sentimental fits like others; but
      in truth I am not insensible to the picturesque or to gratitude, and I
      thank you sincerely for coming, considering that I wrote like a Sphinx&mdash;to
      evade writing comme une folle!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She swept to the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing in the arch of the entrance, she stretched her whip out to a
      black mass of prostrate timber, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It fell in the storm at two o&rsquo;clock after midnight, and you on the sea!&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. HIS HOLIDAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      A single day was to be the term of his holiday at Tourdestelle; but it
      stood forth as one of those perfect days which are rounded by an evening
      before and a morning after, giving him two nights under the same roof with
      Renee, something of a resemblance to three days of her; anticipation and
      wonder filling the first, she the next, the adieu the last: every hour
      filled. And the first day was not over yet. He forced himself to calmness,
      that he might not fritter it, and walked up and down the room he was
      dressing in, examining its foreign decorations, and peering through the
      window, to quiet his nerves. He was in her own France with her! The
      country borrowed hues from Renee, and lent some. This chivalrous France
      framed and interlaced her image, aided in idealizing her, and was in turn
      transfigured. Not half so well would his native land have pleaded for the
      forgiveness of a British damsel who had wrecked a young man&rsquo;s immoderate
      first love. That glorified self-love requires the touch upon imagination
      of strangeness and an unaccustomed grace, to subdue it and make it pardon
      an outrage to its temples and altars, and its happy reading of the
      heavens, the earth too: earth foremost, we ought perhaps to say. It is an
      exacting heathen, best understood by a glance at what will appease it:
      beautiful, however, as everybody has proved; and shall it be decried in a
      world where beauty is not overcommon, though it would slaughter us for its
      angry satisfaction, yet can be soothed by a tone of colour, as it were by
      a novel inscription on a sweetmeat?
    </p>
    <p>
      The peculiarity of Beauchamp was that he knew the slenderness of the
      thread which was leading him, and foresaw it twisting to a coil unless he
      should hold firm. His work in life was much above the love of a woman in
      his estimation, so he was not deluded by passion when he entered the
      chateau; it is doubtful whether he would not hesitatingly have sacrificed
      one of the precious votes in Bevisham for the pleasure of kissing her hand
      when they were on the steps. She was his first love and only love,
      married, and long ago forgiven:&mdash;married; that is to say, she
      especially among women was interdicted to him by the lingering shadow of
      the reverential love gone by; and if the anguish of the lover&rsquo;s worse than
      death survived in a shudder of memory at the thought of her not solely
      lost to him but possessed by another, it did but quicken a hunger that was
      three parts curiosity to see how she who had suffered this bore the
      change; how like or unlike she might be to the extinct Renee; what traces
      she kept of the face he had known. Her tears were startling, but tears
      tell of a mood, they do not tell the story of the years; and it was that
      story he had such eagerness to read in one brief revelation: an eagerness
      born only of the last few hours, and broken by fears of a tarnished
      aspect; these again being partly hopes of a coming disillusion that would
      restore him his independence and ask him only for pity. The slavery of the
      love of a woman chained like Renee was the most revolting of prospects to
      a man who cherished his freedom that he might work to the end of his time.
      Moreover, it swung a thunder-cloud across his holiday. He recurred to the
      idea of the holiday repeatedly, and the more he did so the thinner it
      waned. He was exhausting the very air and spirit of it with a mind that
      ran incessantly forward and back; and when he and the lady of so much
      speculation were again together, an incapacity of observation seemed to
      have come over him. In reality it was the inability to reflect on his
      observations. Her presence resembled those dark sunsets throwing the spell
      of colour across the world; when there is no question with us of morning
      or of night, but of that sole splendour only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owing to their arrival late at the chateau, covers were laid for them in
      the boudoir of Madame la Marquise, where he had his hostess to himself,
      and certainly the opportunity of studying her. An English Navy List,
      solitary on a shelf, and laid within it an extract of a paper announcing
      the return of the Ariadne to port, explained the mystery of her knowing
      that he was in England, as well as the correctness of the superscription
      of her letter to him. &lsquo;You see, I follow you,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp asked if she read English now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A little; but the paper was dispatched to me by M. Vivian Ducie, of your
      embassy in Paris. He is in the valley.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of Ducie recalled Lord Palmet&rsquo;s description of the dark beauty of
      the fluttering pale gold ornaments. She was now dressed without one
      decoration of gold or jewel, with scarcely a wave in the silk, a modesty
      of style eloquent of the pride of her form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could those eyes fronting him under the lamp have recently shed tears?
      They were the living eyes of a brilliant unembarrassed lady; shields
      flinging light rather than well-depths inviting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp tried to compare her with the Renee of Venice, and found himself
      thinking of the glove she had surrendered to the handsomest young man in
      France. The effort to recover the younger face gave him a dead creature,
      with the eyelashes of Renee, the cast of her mouth and throat, misty as a
      shape in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could compare her with Cecilia, who never would have risked a glove,
      never have betrayed a tear, and was the statelier lady, not without
      language: but how much less vivid in feature and the gift of speech!
      Renee&rsquo;s gift of speech counted unnumbered strings which she played on with
      a grace that clothed the skill, and was her natural endowment&mdash;an art
      perfected by the education of the world. Who cannot talk!&mdash;but who
      can? Discover the writers in a day when all are writing! It is as rare an
      art as poetry, and in the mouths of women as enrapturing, richer than
      their voices in music.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the fascination Beauchamp felt weaving round him. Would you, that
      are separable from boys and mobs, and the object malignly called the
      Briton, prefer the celestial singing of a woman to her excellently
      talking? But not if it were given you to run in unison with her genius of
      the tongue, following her verbal ingenuities and feminine silk-flashes of
      meaning; not if she led you to match her fine quick perceptions with more
      or less of the discreet concordance of the violoncello accompanying the
      viol. It is not high flying, which usually ends in heavy falling. You quit
      the level of earth no more than two birds that chase from bush to bush to
      bill in air, for mutual delight to make the concert heavenly. Language
      flowed from Renee in affinity with the pleasure-giving laws that make the
      curves we recognize as beauty in sublimer arts. Accept companionship for
      the dearest of the good things we pray to have, and what equalled her! Who
      could be her rival!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her girl&rsquo;s crown of irradiated Alps began to tremble over her dimly, as
      from moment to moment their intimacy warmed, and Beauchamp saw the young
      face vanishing out of this flower of womanhood. He did not see it
      appearing or present, but vanishing like the faint ray in the rosier. Nay,
      the blot of her faithlessness underwent a transformation: it affected him
      somewhat as the patch cunningly laid on near a liquid dimple in fair
      cheeks at once allures and evades a susceptible attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unused in his French of late, he stumbled at times, and she supplied the
      needed phrase, taking no note of a blunder. Now men of sweet blood cannot
      be secretly accusing or criticizing a gracious lady. Domestic men are
      charged with thinking instantly of dark death when an ordinary illness
      befalls them; and it may be so or not: but it is positive that the gallant
      man of the world, if he is in the sensitive condition, and not yet
      established as the lord of her, feels paralyzed in his masculine sense of
      leadership the moment his lady assumes the initiative and directs him: he
      gives up at once; and thus have many nimble-witted dames from one clear
      start retained their advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning that glove: well! the handsomest young man in France wore the
      glove of the loveliest woman. The loveliest? The very loveliest in the
      purity of her French style&mdash;the woman to challenge England for a type
      of beauty to eclipse her. It was possible to conceive her country wagering
      her against all women.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Renee had faults, Beauchamp thought of her as at sea breasting
      tempests, while Cecilia was a vessel lying safe in harbour, untried,
      however promising: and if Cecilia raised a steady light for him, it was
      over the shores he had left behind, while Renee had really nothing to do
      with warning or rescuing, or with imperilling; she welcomed him simply to
      a holiday in her society. He associated Cecilia strangely with the
      political labours she would have had him relinquish; and Renee with a
      pleasant state of indolence, that her lightest smile disturbed. Shun
      comparisons.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the tricksy heart which sets up that balance, to jump into it on one
      side or the other. Comparisons come of a secret leaning that is sure to
      play rogue under its mien of honest dealer: so Beauchamp suffered himself
      to be unjust to graver England, and lost the strength she would have given
      him to resist a bewitchment. The case with him was, that his
      apprenticeship was new; he had been trotting in harness as a veritable
      cab-horse of politics&mdash;he by blood a racer; and his nature craved for
      diversions, against his will, against his moral sense and born tenacity of
      spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a word further of the glove. But at night, in his bed, the glove was a
      principal actor in events of extraordinary magnitude and inconsequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was out in the grounds with the early morning light. Coffee and sweet
      French bread were brought out to him, and he was informed of the hours of
      reunion at the chateau, whose mistress continued invisible. She might be
      sleeping. He strolled about, within view of the windows, wondering at her
      subservience to sleep. Tourdestelle lay in one of those Norman valleys
      where the river is the mother of rich pasture, and runs hidden between
      double ranks of sallows, aspens and poplars, that mark its winding line in
      the arms of trenched meadows. The high land on either side is an unwatered
      flat up to the horizon, little varied by dusty apple-trees planted in the
      stubble here and there, and brown mud walls of hamlets; a church-top, a
      copse, an avenue of dwarf limes leading to the three-parts farm, quarter
      residence of an enriched peasant striking new roots, or decayed proprietor
      pinching not to be severed from ancient. Descending on the deep green
      valley in Summer is like a change of climes. The chateau stood square at a
      branch of the river, tossing three light bridges of pretty woodwork to
      park and garden. Great bouquets of swelling blue and pink hydrangia
      nestled at his feet on shaven grass. An open window showed a cloth of
      colour, as in a reminiscence of Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp heard himself addressed:&mdash;&lsquo;You are looking for my
      sister-in-law, M. Beauchamp?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker was Madame d&rsquo;Auffray, to whom he had been introduced overnight&mdash;a
      lady of the aquiline French outline, not ungentle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee had spoken affectionately of her, he remembered. There was nothing
      to make him be on his guard, and he stated that he was looking for Madame
      de Rouaillout, and did not conceal surprise at the information that she
      was out on horseback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is a tireless person,&rsquo; Madame d&rsquo;Auffray remarked. &lsquo;You will not miss
      her long. We all meet at twelve, as you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I grudge an hour, for I go to-morrow,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notification of so early a departure, or else his bluntness,
      astonished her. She fell to praising Renee&rsquo;s goodness. He kept her to it
      with lively interrogations, in the manner of a guileless boy urging for
      eulogies of his dear absent friend. Was it duplicity in him or
      artlessness?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has she, do you think, increased in beauty?&rsquo; Madame d&rsquo;Auffray inquired:
      an insidious question, to which he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Once I thought it would be impossible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so bad an answer for an Englishman, in a country where speaking is
      fencing; the race being little famous for dialectical alertness: but was
      it artful or simple?
    </p>
    <p>
      They skirted the chateau, and Beauchamp had the history of Dame Philiberte
      recounted to him, with a mixture of Gallic irony, innuendo, openness,
      touchingness, ridicule, and charity novel to his ears. Madame d&rsquo;Auffray
      struck the note of intimacy earlier than is habitual. She sounded him in
      this way once or twice, carelessly perusing him, and waiting for the
      interesting edition of the Book of Man to summarize its character by
      showing its pages or remaining shut. It was done delicately, like the tap
      of a finger-nail on a vase. He rang clear; he had nothing to conceal; and
      where he was reserved, that is, in speaking of the developed beauty and
      grace of Renee, he was transparent. She read the sort of man he was; she
      could also hazard a guess as to the man&rsquo;s present state. She ventured to
      think him comparatively harmless&mdash;for the hour: for she was not the
      woman to be hoodwinked by man&rsquo;s dark nature because she inclined to think
      well of a particular man; nor was she one to trust to any man subject to
      temptation. The wisdom of the Frenchwoman&rsquo;s fortieth year forbade it. A
      land where the war between the sexes is honestly acknowledged, and is full
      of instruction, abounds in precepts; but it ill becomes the veteran to
      practise rigorously what she would prescribe to young women. She may
      discriminate; as thus:&mdash;Trust no man. Still, this man may be better
      than that man; and it is bad policy to distrust a reasonably guileless
      member of the preying sex entirely, and so to lose his good services.
      Hawks have their uses in destroying vermin; and though we cannot rely upon
      the taming of hawks, one tied by the leg in a garden preserves the fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is a necessity for your leaving us to-morrow; M. Beauchamp?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I regret to say, it is imperative, madame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My husband will congratulate me on the pleasure I have, and have long
      desired, of making your acquaintance, and he will grieve that he has not
      been so fortunate; he is on service in Africa. My brother, I need not say,
      will deplore the mischance which has prevented him from welcoming you. I
      have telegraphed to him; he is at one of the Baths in Germany, and will
      come assuredly, if there is a prospect of finding you here. None?
      Supposing my telegram not to fall short of him, I may count on his being
      here within four days.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp begged her to convey the proper expressions of his regret to M.
      le Marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And M. de Croisnel? And Roland, your old comrade and brother-in-arms?
      What will be their disappointment!&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I intend to stop for an hour at Rouen on my way back,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked if her belle-soeur was aware of the short limitation of his
      visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not mentioned it to Madame la Marquise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps you may be moved by the grief of a friend: Renee may persuade you
      to stay.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I came imagining I could be of some use to Madame la Marquise. She writes
      as if she were telegraphing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perfectly true of her! For that matter, I saw the letter. Your looks
      betray a very natural jealousy; but seeing it or not it would have been
      the same: she and I have no secrets. She was, I may tell you, strictly
      unable to write more words in the letter. Which brings me to inquire what
      impression M. d&rsquo;Henriel made on you yesterday evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is particularly handsome.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We women think so. Did you take him to be... eccentric?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp gave a French jerk of the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      It confessed the incident of the glove to one who knew it as well as he:
      but it masked the weight he was beginning to attach to that incident, and
      Madame d&rsquo;Auffray was misled. Truly, the Englishman may be just such an
      ex-lover, uninflammable by virtue of his blood&rsquo;s native coldness; endued
      with the frozen vanity called pride, which does not seek to be revenged.
      Under wary espionage, he might be a young woman&rsquo;s friend, though male
      friend of a half-abandoned wife should write himself down morally saint,
      mentally sage, medically incurable, if he would win our confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lady of sharp intelligence was the guardian of Renee during the
      foolish husband&rsquo;s flights about Paris and over Europe, and, for a proof of
      her consummate astuteness, Renee had no secrets and had absolute liberty.
      And hitherto no man could build a boast on her reputation. The liberty she
      would have had at any cost, as Madame d&rsquo;Auffray knew; and an attempt to
      restrict it would have created secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near upon the breakfast-hour Renee was perceived by them going toward the
      chateau at a walking pace. They crossed one of the garden bridges to
      intercept her. She started out of some deep meditation, and raised her
      whip hand to Beauchamp&rsquo;s greeting. &lsquo;I had forgotten to tell you, monsieur,
      that I should be out for some hours in the morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you aware,&rsquo; said Madame d&rsquo;Auffray, &lsquo;that M. Beauchamp leaves us
      to-morrow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So soon?&rsquo; It was uttered hardly with a tone of disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquise alighted, crying hold, to the stables, caressed her horse,
      and sent him off with a smack on the smoking flanks to meet the groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow? That is very soon; but M. Beauchamp is engaged in an Election,
      and what have we to induce him to stay?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would it not be better to tell M. Beauchamp why he was invited to come?&rsquo; 
      rejoined Madame d&rsquo;Auffray.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sombre light in Renee&rsquo;s eyes quickened through shadowy spheres of
      surprise and pain to resolution. She cried, &lsquo;You have my full consent,&rsquo; 
      and left them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame d&rsquo;Auffray smiled at Beauchamp, to excuse the childishness of the
      little story she was about to relate; she gave it in the essence, without
      a commencement or an ending. She had in fact but two or three hurried
      minutes before the breakfast-bell would ring; and the fan she opened and
      shut, and at times shaded her head with, was nearly as explicit as her
      tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      He understood that Renee had staked her glove on his coming within a
      certain number of hours to the briefest wording of invitation possible.
      Owing to his detention by the storm, M. d&rsquo;Henriel had won the bet, and now
      insisted on wearing the glove. &lsquo;He is the privileged young madman our
      women make of a handsome youth,&rsquo; said Madame d&rsquo;Auffray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where am I? thought Beauchamp&mdash;in what land, he would have phrased
      it, of whirlwinds catching the wits, and whipping the passions? Calmer
      than they, but unable to command them, and guessing that Renee&rsquo;s errand of
      the morning, by which he had lost hours of her, pertained to the glove, he
      said quiveringly, &lsquo;Madame la Marquise objects?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We,&rsquo; replied Madame d&rsquo;Auffray, &lsquo;contend that the glove was not loyally
      won. The wager was upon your coming to the invitation, not upon your
      conquering the elements. As to his flaunting the glove for a favour, I
      would ask you, whom does he advertize by that? Gloves do not wear white;
      which fact compromises none but the wearer. He picked it up from the
      ground, and does not restore it; that is all. You see a boy who catches at
      anything to placard himself. There is a compatriot of yours, a M. Ducie,
      who assured us you must be with an uncle in your county of Sussex. Of
      course we ran the risk of the letter missing you, but the chance was worth
      a glove. Can you believe it, M. Beauchamp? it was I, old woman as I am, I
      who provoked the silly wager. I have long desired to meet you; and we have
      little society here, we are desperate with loneliness, half mad with our
      whims. I said, that if you were what I had heard of you, you would come to
      us at a word. They dared Madame la Marquise to say the same. I wished to
      see the friend of Frenchmen, as M. Roland calls you; not merely to see him&mdash;to
      know him, whether he is this perfect friend whose absolute devotion has
      impressed my dear sister Renee&rsquo;s mind. She respects you: that is a
      sentiment scarcely complimentary to the ideas of young men. She places you
      above human creatures: possibly you may not dislike to be worshipped. It
      is not to be rejected when one&rsquo;s influence is powerful for good. But you
      leave us to-morrow!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo; might stay...&rsquo; Beauchamp hesitated to name the number of hours. He
      stood divided between a sense of the bubbling shallowness of the life
      about him, and a thought, grave as an eye dwelling on blood, of sinister
      things below it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I may stay another day or two,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;if I can be of any earthly
      service.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame d&rsquo;Auffray bowed as to a friendly decision on his part, saying, &lsquo;It
      would be a thousand pities to disappoint M. Roland; and it will be
      offering my brother an amicable chance. I will send him word that you
      await him; at least, that you defer your departure as long as possible.
      Ah! now you perceive, M. Beauchamp, now you have become aware of our
      purely infantile plan to bring you over to us, how very ostensible a
      punishment it would be were you to remain so short a period.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having no designs, he was neither dupe nor sceptic; but he felt oddly
      entangled, and the dream of his holiday had fled like morning&rsquo;s beams, as
      a self-deception will at a very gentle shaking.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BOAT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Madame d&rsquo;Auffray passed Renee, whispering on her way to take her seat at
      the breakfast-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee did not condescend to whisper. &lsquo;Roland will be glad,&rsquo; she said
      aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her low eyelids challenged Beauchamp for a look of indifference. There was
      more for her to unbosom than Madame d&rsquo;Auffray had revealed, but the
      comparative innocence of her position in this new light prompted her to
      meet him defiantly, if he chose to feel injured. He was attracted by a
      happy contrast of colour between her dress and complexion, together with a
      cavalierly charm in the sullen brows she lifted; and seeing the reverse of
      a look of indifference on his face, after what he had heard of her
      frivolousness, she had a fear that it existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are we not to have M. d&rsquo;Henriel to-day? he amuses me,&rsquo; the baronne
      d&rsquo;Orbec remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he would learn that he was fashioned for that purpose!&rsquo; exclaimed
      little M. Livret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not ask young men for too much head, my friend; he would cease to be
      amusing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;D&rsquo;Henriel should have been up in the fields at ten this morning,&rsquo; said M.
      d&rsquo;Orbec. &lsquo;As to his head, I back him for a clever shot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or a duelling-sword,&rsquo; said Renee. &lsquo;It is a quality, count it for what we
      will. Your favourite, Madame la Baronne, is interdicted from presenting
      himself here so long as he persists in offending me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was requested to explain, and, with the fair ingenuousness which
      outshines innocence, she touched on the story of the glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! what a delicate, what an exciting, how subtle a question!
    </p>
    <p>
      Had M. d&rsquo;Henriel the right to possess it? and, having that, had he the
      right to wear it at his breast?
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp was dragged into the discussion of the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee waited curiously for his judgement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pleading an apology for the stormy weather, which had detained him, and
      for his ignorance that so precious an article was at stake, he held, that
      by the terms of the wager, the glove was lost; the claim to wear it was a
      matter of taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Matters of taste, monsieur, are not, I think, decided by weapons in your
      country?&rsquo; said M. d&rsquo;Orbec.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have no duelling,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman imagined the confession to be somewhat humbling, and
      generously added, &lsquo;But you have your volunteers&mdash;a magnificent
      spectacle of patriotism and national readiness for defence!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A shrewd pang traversed Beauchamp&rsquo;s heart, as he looked back on his
      country from the outside and the inside, thinking what amount of patriotic
      readiness the character of the volunteering signified, in the face of all
      that England has to maintain. Like a politic islander, he allowed the
      patriotic spectacle to be imagined; reflecting that it did a sort of
      service abroad, and had only to be unmasked at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you surrendered the glove, marquise!&rsquo; The baronne d&rsquo;Orbec spoke
      judicially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I flung it to the ground: that made it neutral,&rsquo; said Renee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hum. He wears it with the dust on it, certainly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And for how long a time,&rsquo; M. Livret wished to know, &lsquo;does this amusing
      young man proclaim his intention of wearing the glove?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Until he can see with us that his Order of Merit is utter kid,&rsquo; said
      Madame d&rsquo;Auffray; and as she had spoken more or less neatly, satisfaction
      was left residing in the ear of the assembly, and the glove was permitted
      to be swept away on a fresh tide of dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The admirable candour of Renee in publicly alluding to M. d&rsquo;Henriel&rsquo;s
      foolishness restored a peep of his holiday to Beauchamp. Madame d&rsquo;Auffray
      took note of the effect it produced, and quite excused her sister-in-law
      for intending to produce is; but that speaking out the half-truth that we
      may put on the mask of the whole, is no new trick; and believing as she
      did that Renee was in danger with the handsome Count Henri, the practice
      of such a kind of honesty on her part appeared alarming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still it is imprudent to press for confidences when our friend&rsquo;s heart is
      manifestly trifling with sincerity. Who knows but that some foregone
      reckless act or word may have superinduced the healthy shame which cannot
      speak, which must disguise itself, and is honesty in that form, but
      roughly troubled would resolve to rank dishonesty? So thought the patient
      lady, wiser in that than in her perceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee made a boast of not persuading her guest to stay, avowing that she
      would not willingly have him go. Praising him equably, she listened to
      praise of him with animation. She was dumb and statue-like when Count
      Henri&rsquo;s name was mentioned. Did not this betray liking for one, subjection
      to the other? Indeed, there was an Asiatic splendour of animal beauty
      about M. d&rsquo;Henriel that would be serpent with most women, Madame d&rsquo;Auffray
      conceived; why not with the deserted Renee, who adored beauty of shape and
      colour, and was compassionate toward a rashness of character that her own
      unnatural solitariness and quick spirit made her emulous of?
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Beauchamp&rsquo;s day of adieu succeeded that of his holiday, and no
      adieu was uttered. The hours at Tourdestelle had a singular turn for
      slipping. Interlinked and all as one they swam by, brought evening,
      brought morning, never varied. They might have varied with such a division
      as when flame lights up the night or a tempest shades the day, had Renee
      chosen; she had that power over him. She had no wish to use it; perhaps
      she apprehended what it would cause her to forfeit. She wished him to
      respect her; felt that she was under the shadow of the glove, slight
      though it was while it was nothing but a tale of a lady and a glove; and
      her desire, like his, was that they should meet daily and dream on,
      without a variation. He noticed how seldom she led him beyond the grounds
      of the chateau. They were to make excursions when her brother came, she
      said. Roland de Croisnel&rsquo;s colonel, Coin de Grandchamp, happened to be
      engaged in a duel, which great business detained Roland. It supplied
      Beauchamp with an excuse for staying, that he was angry with himself for
      being pleased to have; so he attacked the practice of duelling, and next
      the shrug, wherewith M. Livret and M. d&rsquo;Orbec sought at first to defend
      the foul custom, or apologize for it, or plead for it philosophically, or
      altogether cast it off their shoulders; for the literal interpretation of
      the shrug in argument is beyond human capacity; it is the point of speech
      beyond our treasury of language. He attacked the shrug, as he thought,
      very temperately; but in controlling his native vehemence he grew,
      perforce of repression, and of incompetency to deliver himself copiously
      in French, sarcastic. In fine, his contrast of the pretence of their noble
      country to head civilization, and its encouragement of a custom so
      barbarous, offended M. d&rsquo;Orbec and irritated M. Livret.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter delivered a brief essay on Gallic blood; the former maintained
      that Frenchmen were the best judges of their own ways and deeds.
      Politeness reigned, but politeness is compelled to throw off cloak and
      jacket when it steps into the arena to meet the encounter of a bull.
      Beauchamp drew on their word &lsquo;solidaire&rsquo; to assist him in declaring that
      no civilized nation could be thus independent. Imagining himself in the
      France of brave ideas, he contrived to strike out sparks of Legitimist ire
      around him, and found himself breathing the atmosphere of the most
      primitive nursery of Toryism. Again he encountered the shrug, and he would
      have it a verbal matter. M. d&rsquo;Orbec gravely recited the programme of the
      country party in France. M. Livret carried the war across Channel. You
      English have retired from active life, like the exhausted author, to turn
      critic&mdash;the critic that sneers: unless we copy you abjectly we are
      execrable. And what is that sneer? Materially it is an acrid saliva,
      withering where it drops; in the way of fellowship it is a
      corpse-emanation. As to wit, the sneer is the cloak of clumsiness; it is
      the Pharisee&rsquo;s incense, the hypocrite&rsquo;s pity, the post of exaltation of
      the fat citizen, etc.; but, said M. Livret, the people using it should
      have a care that they keep powerful: they make no friends. He terminated
      with this warning to a nation not devoid of superior merit. M. d&rsquo;Orbec
      said less, and was less consoled by his outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the opinion of Mr. Vivian Ducie, present at the discussion, Beauchamp
      provoked the lash; for, in the first place, a beautiful woman&rsquo;s apparent
      favourite should be particularly discreet in all that he says: and next,
      he should have known that the Gallic shrug over matters political is
      volcanic&mdash;it is the heaving of the mountain, and, like the proverbial
      Russ, leaps up Tartarly at a scratch. Our newspapers also had been
      flea-biting M. Livret and his countrymen of late; and, to conclude, over
      in old England you may fly out against what you will, and there is little
      beyond a motherly smile, a nurse&rsquo;s rebuke, or a fool&rsquo;s rudeness to answer
      you. In quick-blooded France you have whip for whip, sneer, sarcasm, claw,
      fang, tussle, in a trice; and if you choose to comport yourself according
      to your insular notion of freedom, you are bound to march out to the
      measured ground at an invitation. To begin by saying that your principles
      are opposed to it, naturally excites a malicious propensity to try your
      temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      A further cause, unknown to Mr. Ducie, of M. Livret&rsquo;s irritation was, that
      Beauchamp had vexed him on a subject peculiarly dear to him. The
      celebrated Chateau Dianet was about to be visited by the guests at
      Tourdestelle. In common with some French philosophers and English matrons,
      he cherished a sentimental sad enthusiasm for royal concubines; and when
      dilating upon one among them, the ruins of whose family&rsquo;s castle stood in
      the neighbourhood-Agrees, who was really a kindly soul, though not
      virtuous&mdash;M. Livret had been traversed by Beauchamp with questions as
      to the condition of the people, the peasantry, that were sweated in taxes
      to support these lovely frailties. They came oddly from a man in the fire
      of youth, and a little old gentleman somewhat seduced by the melting image
      of his theme might well blink at him to ask, of what flesh are you, then?
      His historic harem was insulted. Personally too, the fair creature
      picturesquely soiled, intrepid in her amorousness, and ultimately absolved
      by repentance (a shuddering narrative of her sins under showers of salt
      drops), cried to him to champion her. Excited by the supposed cold
      critical mind in Beauchamp, M. Livret painted and painted this lady,
      tricked her in casuistical niceties, scenes of pomp and boudoir pathos,
      with many shifting sidelights and a risky word or two, until Renee cried
      out, &lsquo;Spare us the esprit Gaulois, M. Livret!&rsquo; There was much to make him
      angry with this Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The esprit Gaulois is the sparkle of crystal common sense, madame, and
      may we never abandon it for a Puritanism that hides its face to conceal
      its filthiness, like a stagnant pond,&rsquo; replied M. Livret, flashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems, then, that there are two ways of being objectionable,&rsquo; said
      Renee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! Madame la Marquise, your wit is French,&rsquo; he breathed low; &lsquo;keep your
      heart so!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Both M. Livret and M. d&rsquo;Orbec had forgotten that when Count Henri
      d&rsquo;Henriel was received at Tourdestelle, the arrival of the Englishman was
      pleasantly anticipated by them as an eclipse of the handsome boy; but a
      foreign interloper is quickly dispossessed of all means of pleasing save
      that one of taking his departure; and they now talked of Count Henri&rsquo;s
      disgrace and banishment in a very warm spirit of sympathy, not at all
      seeing why it should be made to depend upon the movements of this M.
      Beauchamp, as it appeared to be. Madame d&rsquo;Auffray heard some of their
      dialogue, and hurried with a mouth full of comedy to Renee, who did not
      reproach them for silly beings, as would be done elsewhere. On the
      contrary, she appreciated a scene of such absolute comedy, recognizing it
      instantly as a situation plucked out of human nature. She compared them to
      republicans that regretted the sovereign they had deposed for a pretender
      to start up and govern them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who hurries them round to the legitimate king again!&rsquo; said Madame
      d&rsquo;Auffray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee cast her chin up. &lsquo;How, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your husband.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What of him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is returning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What brings him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You should ask who, my Renee! I was sure he would not hear of M.
      Beauchamp&rsquo;s being here, without an effort to return and do the honours of
      the chateau.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee looked hard at her, saying, &lsquo;How thoughtful of you! You must have
      made use of the telegraph wires to inform him that M. Beauchamp was with
      us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More; I made use of them to inform him that M. Beauchamp was expected.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that was enough to bring him! He pays M. Beauchamp a wonderful
      compliment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Such as he would pay to no other man, my Renee. Virtually it is the
      highest of compliments to you. I say that to M. Beauchamp&rsquo;s credit; for
      Raoul has met him, and, whatever his personal feeling may be, must know
      your friend is a man of honour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friend is... yes, I have no reason to think otherwise,&rsquo; Renee replied.
      Her husband&rsquo;s persistent and exclusive jealousy of Beauchamp was the
      singular point in the character of one who appeared to have no sentiment
      of the kind as regarded men that were much less than men of honour. &lsquo;So,
      then, my sister Agnes,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you suggested the invitation of M.
      Beauchamp for the purpose of spurring my husband to return! Apparently he
      and I are surrounded by plotters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I so very guilty?&rsquo; said Madame d&rsquo;Auffray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If that mad boy, half idiot, half panther, were by chance to insult M.
      Beauchamp, you would feel so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have taken precautions to prevent their meeting; and besides, M.
      Beauchamp does not fight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee flushed crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame d&rsquo;Auffray added, &lsquo;I do not say that he is other than a perfectly
      brave and chivalrous gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; cried Renee, &lsquo;do not say it, if ever you should imagine it. Bid
      Roland speak of him. He is changed, oppressed: I did him a terrible wrong
      ....&rsquo; She checked herself. &lsquo;But the chief thing to do is to keep M.
      d&rsquo;Henriel away from him. I suspect M. d&rsquo;Orbec of a design to make them
      clash: and you, my dear, will explain why, to flatter me. Believe me, I
      thirst for flattery; I have had none since M. Beauchamp came: and you, so
      acute, must have seen the want of it in my face. But you, so skilful,
      Agnes, will manage these men. Do you know, Agnes, that the pride of a
      woman so incredibly clever as you have shown me you are should resent
      their intrigues and overthrow them. As for me, I thought I could command
      M. d&rsquo;Henriel, and I find he has neither reason in him nor obedience.
      Singular to say, I knew him just as well a week back as I do now, and then
      I liked him for his qualities&mdash;or the absence of any. But how shall
      we avoid him on the road to Dianet? He is aware that we are going.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take M. Beauchamp by boat,&rsquo; said Madame d&rsquo;Auffray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The river winds to within a five minutes&rsquo; walk of Dianet; we could go by
      boat,&rsquo; Renee said musingly. &lsquo;I thought of the boat. But does it not give
      the man a triumph that we should seem to try to elude him? What matter!
      Still, I do not like him to be the falcon, and Nevil Beauchamp the...
      little bird. So it is, because we began badly, Agnes!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was it my fault?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mine. Tell me: the legitimate king returns when?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In two days or three.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And his rebel subjects are to address him&mdash;how?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame d&rsquo;Auffray smote the point of a finger softly on her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will they be pardoned?&rsquo; said Renee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is for him to kneel, my dearest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Legitimacy kneeling for forgiveness is a painful picture, Agnes.
      Legitimacy jealous of a foreigner is an odd one. However, we are women,
      born to our lot. If we could rise en masse!&mdash;but we cannot. Embrace
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame d&rsquo;Auffray embraced her, without an idea that she assisted in
      performing the farewell of their confidential intimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Renee trifled with Count Henri, it was playing with fire, and she
      knew it; and once or twice she bemoaned to Agnes d&rsquo;Auffray her abandoned
      state, which condemned her, for the sake of the sensation of living, to
      have recourse to perilous pastimes; but she was revolted, as at a piece of
      treachery, that Agnes should have suggested the invitation of Nevil
      Beauchamp with the secret design of winning home her husband to protect
      her. This, for one reason, was because Beauchamp gave her no notion of
      danger; none, therefore, of requiring protection; and the presence of her
      husband could not but be hateful to him, an undeserved infliction. To her
      it was intolerable that they should be brought into contact. It seemed
      almost as hard that she should have to dismiss Beauchamp to preclude their
      meeting. She remembered, nevertheless, a certain desperation of mind,
      scarce imaginable in the retrospect, by which, trembling, fever-smitten,
      scorning herself, she had been reduced to hope for Nevil Beauchamp&rsquo;s
      coming as for a rescue. The night of the storm had roused her heart. Since
      then his perfect friendliness had lulled, his air of thoughtfulness had
      interested it; and the fancy that he, who neither reproached nor
      sentimentalized, was to be infinitely compassionated, stirred up remorse.
      She could not tell her friend Agnes of these feelings while her feelings
      were angered against her friend. So she talked lightly of &lsquo;the legitimate
      king,&rsquo; and they embraced: a situation of comedy quite as true as that
      presented by the humble admirers of the brilliant chatelaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp had the pleasure of rowing Madame la Marquise to the short
      shaded walk separating the river from Chateau Dianet, whither M. d&rsquo;Orbec
      went on horseback, and Madame d&rsquo;Auffray and M. Livret were driven. The
      portrait of Diane of Dianet was praised for the beauty of the dame, a
      soft-fleshed acutely featured person, a fresh-of-the-toilette face, of the
      configuration of head of the cat, relieved by a delicately aquiline nose;
      and it could only be the cat of fairy metamorphosis which should stand for
      that illustration: brows and chin made an acceptable triangle, and eyes
      and mouth could be what she pleased for mice or monarchs. M. Livret did
      not gainsay the impeachment of her by a great French historian, tender to
      women, to frailties in particular&mdash;yes, she was cold, perhaps
      grasping: but dwell upon her in her character of woman; conceive her
      existing, to estimate the charm of her graciousness. Name the two
      countries which alone have produced THE WOMAN, the ideal woman, the woman
      of art, whose beauty, grace, and wit offer her to our contemplation in an
      atmosphere above the ordinary conditions of the world: these two countries
      are France and Greece! None other give you the perfect woman, the woman
      who conquers time, as she conquers men, by virtue of the divinity in her
      blood; and she, as little as illustrious heroes, is to be judged by the
      laws and standards of lesser creatures. In fashioning her, nature and art
      have worked together: in her, poetry walks the earth. The question of good
      or bad is entirely to be put aside: it is a rustic&rsquo;s impertinence&mdash;a
      bourgeois&rsquo; vulgarity. She is preeminent, voila tout. Has she grace and
      beauty? Then you are answered: such possessions are an assurance that her
      influence in the aggregate must be for good. Thunder, destructive to
      insects, refreshes earth: so she. So sang the rhapsodist. Possibly a
      scholarly little French gentleman, going down the grey slopes of sixty to
      second childishness, recovers a second juvenility in these enthusiasms;
      though what it is that inspires our matrons to take up with them is
      unimaginable. M. Livret&rsquo;s ardour was a contrast to the young Englishman&rsquo;s
      vacant gaze at Diane, and the symbols of her goddesship running along the
      walls, the bed, the cabinets, everywhere that the chaste device could find
      frontage and a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. d&rsquo;Orbec remained outside the chateau inspecting the fish-ponds. When
      they rejoined him he complimented Beauchamp semi-ironically on his choice
      of the river&rsquo;s quiet charms in preference to the dusty roads. Madame de
      Rouaillout said, &lsquo;Come, M. d&rsquo;Orbec; what if you surrender your horse to M.
      Beauchamp, and row me back?&rsquo; He changed colour, hesitated, and declined he
      had an engagement to call on M. d&rsquo;Henriel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When did you see him?&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was confused. &lsquo;It is not long since, madame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the road?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Coming along-the road.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And our glove?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madame la Marquise, if I may trust my memory, M. d&rsquo;Henriel was not in
      official costume.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee allowed herself to be reassured.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ceremonious visit that M. Livret insisted on was paid to the chapel of
      Diane, where she had worshipped and laid her widowed ashes, which, said M.
      Livret, the fiends of the Revolution would not let rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his voice to denounce them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Roland de Croisnel that answered: &lsquo;The Revolution was our
      grandmother, monsieur, and I cannot hear her abused.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee caught her brother by the hand. He stepped out of the chapel with
      Beauchamp to embrace him; then kissed Renee, and, remarking that she was
      pale, fetched flooding colour to her cheeks. He was hearty air to them
      after the sentimentalism they had been hearing. Beauchamp and he walked
      like loving comrades at school, questioning, answering, chattering,
      laughing,&mdash;a beautiful sight to Renee, and she looked at Agrnes
      d&rsquo;Auffray to ask her whether &lsquo;this Englishman&rsquo; was not one of them in his
      frankness and freshness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland stopped to turn to Renee. &lsquo;I met d&rsquo;Henriel on my ride here,&rsquo; he
      said with a sharp inquisitive expression of eye that passed immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You rode here from Tourdestelle, then,&rsquo; said Renee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has he been one of the company, marquise?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did he ride by you without speaking, Roland?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thus.&rsquo; Roland described a Spanish caballero&rsquo;s formallest salutation,
      saying to Beauchamp, &lsquo;Not the best sample of our young Frenchman;&mdash;woman-spoiled!
      Not that the better kind of article need be spoiled by them&mdash;heaven
      forbid that! Friend Nevil,&rsquo; he spoke lower, &lsquo;do you know, you have
      something of the prophet in you? I remember: much has come true. An old
      spoiler of women is worse than one spoiled by them! Ah, well: and Madame
      Culling? and your seven-feet high uncle? And have you a fleet to satisfy
      Nevil Beauchamp yet? You shall see a trial of our new field-guns at
      Rouen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were separated with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee wished her brother to come in the boat; and he would have done so,
      but for his objection to have his Arab bestridden by a man unknown to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My love is a four-foot, and here&rsquo;s my love,&rsquo; Roland said, going outside
      the gilt gate-rails to the graceful little beast, that acknowledged his
      ownership with an arch and swing of the neck round to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He mounted and called, &lsquo;Au revoir, M. le Capitaine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Au revoir, M. le Commandant,&rsquo; cried Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Admiral and marshal, each of us in good season,&rsquo; said Roland. &lsquo;Thanks to
      your promotion, I had a letter from my sister. Advance a grade, and I may
      get another.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp thought of the strange gulf now between him and the time when he
      pined to be a commodore, and an admiral. The gulf was bridged as he looked
      at Renee petting Roland&rsquo;s horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there in the world so lovely a creature?&rsquo; she said, and appealed
      fondlingly to the beauty that brings out beauty, and, bidding it disdain
      rivalry, rivalled it insomuch that in a moment of trance Beauchamp with
      his bodily vision beheld her, not there, but on the Lido of Venice,
      shining out of the years gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old love reviving may be love of a phantom after all. We can, if it must
      revive, keep it to the limits of a ghostly love. The ship in the Arabian
      tale coming within the zone of the magnetic mountain, flies all its bolts
      and bars, and becomes sheer timbers, but that is the carelessness of the
      ship&rsquo;s captain; and hitherto Beauchamp could applaud himself for steering
      with prudence, while Renee&rsquo;s attractions warned more than they beckoned.
      She was magnetic to him as no other woman was. Then whither his course but
      homeward?
    </p>
    <p>
      After they had taken leave of their host and hostess of Chateau Dianet,
      walking across a meadow to a line of charmilles that led to the
      river-side, he said, &lsquo;Now I have seen Roland I shall have to decide upon
      going.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wantonly won is deservedly lost,&rsquo; said Renee. &lsquo;But do not disappoint my
      Roland much because of his foolish sister. Is he not looking handsome? And
      he is young to be a commandant, for we have no interest at this Court.
      They kept him out of the last war! My father expects to find you at
      Tourdestelle, and how account to him for your hurried flight? save with
      the story of that which brought you to us!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The glove? I shall beg for the fellow to it before I depart, marquise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You perceived my disposition to light-headedness, monsieur, when I was a
      girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I said that I&mdash;But the past is dust. Shall I ever see you in
      England?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That country seems to frown on me. But if I do not go there, nor you come
      here, except to imperious mysterious invitations, which will not be
      repeated, the future is dust as well as the past: for me, at least. Dust
      here, dust there!&mdash;if one could be like a silk-worm, and live lying
      on the leaf one feeds on, it would be a sort of answer to the riddle&mdash;living
      out of the dust, and in the present. I find none in my religion. No doubt,
      Madame de Breze did: why did you call Diane so to M. Livret?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him smiling as they came out of the shadow of the clipped
      trees. He was glancing about for the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The boat is across the river,&rsquo; Renee said, in a voice that made him seek
      her eyes for an explanation of the dead sound. She was very pale. &lsquo;You
      have perfect command of yourself? For my sake!&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing up in the boat, against the opposite bank, and leaning with
      crossed legs on one of the sculls planted in the gravel of the river,
      Count Henri d&rsquo;Henriel&rsquo;s handsome figure presented itself to Beauchamp&rsquo;s
      gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a dryness that smacked of his uncle Everard Romfrey, Beauchamp said
      of the fantastical posture of the young man, &lsquo;One can do that on fresh
      water.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee did not comprehend the sailor-sarcasm of the remark; but she also
      commented on the statuesque appearance of Count Henri: &lsquo;Is the pose for
      photography or for sculpture?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither of them showed a sign of surprise or of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. d&rsquo;Henriel could not maintain the attitude. He uncrossed his legs
      deliberately, drooped hat in hand, and came paddling over; apologized
      indolently, and said, &lsquo;I am not, I believe, trespassing on the grounds of
      Tourdestelle, Madame la Marquise!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You happen to be in my boat, M. le Comte,&rsquo; said Renee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Permit me, madame.&rsquo; He had set one foot on shore, with his back to
      Beauchamp, and reached a hand to assist her step into the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp caught fast hold of the bows while Renee laid a finger on Count
      Henri&rsquo;s shoulder to steady herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant she had taken her seat, Count Henri dashed the scull&rsquo;s blade
      at the bank to push off with her, but the boat was fast. His manoeuvre had
      been foreseen. Beauchamp swung on board like the last seaman of a launch,
      and crouched as the boat rocked away to the stream; and still Count Henri
      leaned on the scull, not in a chosen attitude, but for positive support.
      He had thrown his force into the blow, to push off triumphantly, and leave
      his rival standing. It occurred that the boat&rsquo;s brief resistance and
      rocking away agitated his artificial equipoise, and, by the operation of
      inexorable laws, the longer he leaned across an extending surface the more
      was he dependent; so that when the measure of the water exceeded the
      length of his failing support on land, there was no help for it: he
      pitched in. His grimace of chagrin at the sight of Beauchamp securely
      established, had scarcely yielded to the grimness of feature of the man
      who feels he must go, as he took the plunge; and these two emotions
      combined to make an extraordinary countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went like a gallant gentleman; he threw up his heels to clear the boat,
      dropping into about four feet of water, and his first remark on rising
      was, &lsquo;I trust, madame, I have not had the misfortune to splash you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he waded to the bank, scrambled to his feet, and drew out his
      moustachios to their curving ends. Renee nodded sharply to Beauchamp to
      bid him row. He, with less of wisdom, having seized the floating scull
      abandoned by Count Henri, and got it ready for the stroke, said a word of
      condolence to the dripping man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Henri&rsquo;s shoulders and neck expressed a kind of negative that, like a
      wet dog&rsquo;s shake of the head, ended in an involuntary whole length shudder,
      dog-like and deplorable to behold. He must have been conscious of this
      miserable exhibition of himself; he turned to Beauchamp: &lsquo;You are, I am
      informed, a sailor, monsieur. I compliment you on your naval tactics: our
      next meeting will be on land. Au revoir, monsieur. Madame la Marquise, I
      have the honour to salute you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words he retreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Row quickly, I beg of you,&rsquo; Renee said to Beauchamp. Her desire was to
      see Roland, and open her heart to her brother; for now it had to be
      opened. Not a minute must be lost to prevent further mischief. And who was
      guilty? she. Her heart clamoured of her guilt to waken a cry of innocence.
      A disdainful pity for the superb young savage just made ludicrous,
      relieved him of blame, implacable though he was. He was nothing; an
      accident&mdash;a fool. But he might become a terrible instrument of
      punishment. The thought of that possibility gave it an aspect of
      retribution, under which her cry of innocence was insufferable in its
      feebleness. It would have been different with her if Beauchamp had taken
      advantage of her fever of anxiety, suddenly appeased by the sight of him
      on the evening of his arrival at Tourdestelle after the storm, to attempt
      a renewal of their old broken love-bonds. Then she would have seen only a
      conflict between two men, neither of whom could claim a more secret right
      than the other to be called her lover, and of whom both were on a common
      footing, and partly despicable. But Nevil Beauchamp had behaved as her
      perfect true friend, in the character she had hoped for when she summoned
      him. The sense of her guilt lay in the recognition that he had saved her.
      From what? From the consequences of delirium rather than from love&mdash;surely
      delirium, founded on delusion; love had not existed. She had said to Count
      Henri, &lsquo;You speak to me of love. I was beloved when I was a girl, before
      my marriage, and for years I have not seen or corresponded with the man
      who loved me, and I have only to lift my finger now and he will come to
      me, and not once will he speak to me of love.&rsquo; Those were the words
      originating the wager of the glove. But what of her, if Nevil Beauchamp
      had not come?
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heart jumped, and she blushed ungovernably in his face,&mdash;as if he
      were seeing her withdraw her foot from the rock&rsquo;s edge, and had that
      instant rescued her. But how came it she had been so helpless? She could
      ask; she could not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking, talking to her heart, was useless. The deceiver simply feigned
      utter condemnation to make partial comfort acceptable. She burned to do
      some act of extreme self-abasement that should bring an unwonted degree of
      wrath on her externally, and so re-entitle her to consideration in her own
      eyes. She burned to be interrogated, to have to weep, to be scorned,
      abused, and forgiven, that she might say she did not deserve pardon.
      Beauchamp was too English, evidently too blind, for the description of
      judge-accuser she required; one who would worry her without mercy,
      until-disgraced by the excess of torture inflicted&mdash;he should
      reinstate her by as much as he had overcharged his accusation, and a
      little more. Reasonably enough, instinctively in fact, she shunned the
      hollow of an English ear. A surprise was in reserve for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp gave up rowing. As he rested on the sculls, his head was bent
      and turned toward the bank. Renee perceived an over-swollen monster gourd
      that had strayed from a garden adjoining the river, and hung sliding
      heavily down the bank on one greenish yellow cheek, in prolonged
      contemplation of its image in the mirror below. Apparently this obese
      Narcissus enchained his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tapped her foot. &lsquo;Are you tired of rowing, monsieur?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was exactly here,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that you told me you expected your
      husband&rsquo;s return.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at the gourd, bit her lip, and, colouring, said, &lsquo;At what
      point of the river did I request you to congratulate me on it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not have said that, if she had known the thoughts at work within
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He set the boat swaying from side to side, and at once the hugeous
      reflection of that conceivably self-enamoured bulk quavered and distended,
      and was shattered in a thousand dancing fragments, to re-unite and
      recompose its maudlin air of imaged satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to have a vague idea that he was indulging grotesque fancies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very strangely, the ridiculous thing, in the shape of an over-stretched
      likeness, that she never would have seen had he indicated it directly,
      became transfused from his mind to hers by his abstract, half-amused
      observation of the great dancing gourd&mdash;that capering antiquity,
      lumbering volatility, wandering, self-adored, gross bald Cupid, elatest of
      nondescripts! Her senses imagined the impressions agitating Beauchamp&rsquo;s,
      and exaggerated them beyond limit; and when he amazed her with a straight
      look into her eyes, and the words, &lsquo;Better let it be a youth&mdash;and
      live, than fall back to that!&rsquo; she understood him immediately; and,
      together with her old fear of his impetuosity and downrightness, came the
      vivid recollection, like a bright finger pointing upon darkness, of what
      foul destiny, magnified by her present abhorrence of it, he would have
      saved her from in the days of Venice and Touraine, and unto what loathly
      example of the hideous grotesque she, in spite of her lover&rsquo;s foresight on
      her behalf, had become allied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Face to face as they sat, she had no defence for her scarlet cheeks; her
      eyes wavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will land here; the cottagers shall row the boat up,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Somewhere&mdash;anywhere,&rsquo; said Beauchamp. &lsquo;But I must speak. I will tell
      you now. I do not think you to blame&mdash;barely; not in my sight; though
      no man living would have suffered as I should. Probably some days more and
      you would have been lost. You looked for me! Trust your instinct now I&rsquo;m
      with you as well as when I&rsquo;m absent. Have you courage? that &lsquo;s the
      question. You have years to live. Can you live them in this place&mdash;with
      honour? and alive really?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee&rsquo;s eyes grew wide; she tried to frown, and her brows merely twitched;
      to speak, and she was inarticulate. His madness, miraculous penetration,
      and the super-masculine charity in him, unknown to the world of young men
      in their treatment of women, excited, awed, and melted her. He had seen
      the whole truth of her relations with M. d&rsquo;Henriel!&mdash;the wickedness
      of them in one light, the innocence in another; and without prompting a
      confession he forgave her. Could she believe it? This was love, and manly
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      She yearned to be on her feet, to feel the possibility of an escape from
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pointed to a landing. He sprang to the bank. &lsquo;It could end in nothing
      else,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;unless you beat cold to me. And now I have your hand,
      Renee! It&rsquo;s the hand of a living woman, you have no need to tell me that;
      but faithful to her comrade! I can swear it for her&mdash;faithful to a
      true alliance! You are not married, you are simply chained: and you are
      terrorized. What a perversion of you it is! It wrecks you. But with me? Am
      I not your lover? You and I are one life. What have we suffered for but to
      find this out and act on it? Do I not know that a woman lives, and is not
      the rooted piece of vegetation hypocrites and tyrants expect her to be?
      Act on it, I say; own me, break the chains, come to me; say, Nevil
      Beauchamp or death! And death for you? But you are poisoned and
      thwart-eddying, as you live now: worse, shaming the Renee I knew.
      Ah-Venice! But now we are both of us wiser and stronger: we have gone
      through fire. Who foretold it? This day, and this misery and perversion
      that we can turn to joy, if we will&mdash;if you will! No heart to dare is
      no heart to love!&mdash;answer that! Shall I see you cower away from me
      again? Not this time!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He swept on in a flood, uttered mad things, foolish things, and things of
      an insight electrifying to her. Through the cottager&rsquo;s garden, across a
      field, and within the park gates of Tourdestelle it continued unceasingly;
      and deeply was she won by the rebellious note in all that he said, deeply
      too by his disregard of the vulgar arts of wooers: she detected none. He
      did not speak so much to win as to help her to see with her own orbs. Nor
      was it roughly or chidingly, though it was absolutely, that he stripped
      her of the veil a wavering woman will keep to herself from her heart&rsquo;s
      lord if she can.
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived long after the boat at Tourdestelle, and Beauchamp might
      believe he had prevailed with her, but for her forlorn repetition of the
      question he had put to her idly and as a new idea, instead of
      significantly, with a recollection and a doubt &lsquo;Have I courage, Nevil?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The grain of common sense in cowardice caused her to repeat it when her
      reason was bedimmed, and passion assumed the right to show the way of
      right and wrong.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. MR. BLACKBURN TUCKHAM
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some time after Beauchamp had been seen renewing his canvass in Bevisham a
      report reached Mount Laurels that he was lame of a leg. The wits of the
      opposite camp revived the FRENCH MARQUEES, but it was generally
      acknowledged that he had come back without the lady: she was invisible.
      Cecilia Halkett rode home with her father on a dusky Autumn evening, and
      found the card of Commander Beauchamp awaiting her. He might have stayed
      to see her, she thought. Ladies are not customarily so very late in
      returning from a ride on chill evenings of Autumn. Only a quarter of an
      hour was between his visit and her return. The shortness of the interval
      made it appear the deeper gulf. She noticed that her father particularly
      inquired of the man-servant whether Captain Beauchamp limped. It seemed a
      piece of kindly anxiety on his part. The captain was mounted, the man
      said. Cecilia was conscious of rumours being abroad relating to Nevil&rsquo;s
      expedition to France; but he had enemies, and was at war with them, and
      she held herself indifferent to tattle. This card bearing his name,
      recently in his hand, was much more insidious and precise. She took it to
      her room to look at it. Nothing but his name and naval title was
      inscribed; no pencilled line; she had not expected to discover one. The
      simple card was her dark light, as a handkerchief, a flower, a knot of
      riband, has been for men luridly illuminated by such small sparks to fling
      their beams on shadows and read the monstrous things for truths. Her purer
      virgin blood was, not inflamed. She read the signification of the card
      sadly as she did clearly. What she could not so distinctly imagine was,
      how he could reconcile the devotion to his country, which he had taught
      her to put her faith in, with his unhappy subjection to Madame de
      Rouaillout. How could the nobler sentiment exist side by side with one
      that was lawless? Or was the wildness characteristic of his political
      views proof of a nature inclining to disown moral ties? She feared so; he
      did not speak of the clergy respectfully. Reading in the dark, she was
      forced to rely on her social instincts, and she distrusted her personal
      feelings as much as she could, for she wished to know the truth of him;
      anything, pain and heartrending, rather than the shutting of the eyes in
      an unworthy abandonment to mere emotion and fascination. Cecilia&rsquo;s love
      could not be otherwise given to a man, however near she might be drawn to
      love&mdash;though she should suffer the pangs of love cruelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She placed his card in her writing-desk; she had his likeness there.
      Commander Beauchamp encouraged the art of photography, as those that make
      long voyages do, in reciprocating what they petition their friends for.
      Mrs. Rosamund Culling had a whole collection of photographs of him, equal
      to a visual history of his growth in chapters, from boyhood to
      midshipmanship and to manhood. The specimen possessed by Cecilia was one
      of a couple that Beauchamp had forwarded to Mrs. Grancey Lespel on the day
      of his departure for France, and was a present from that lady, purchased,
      like so many presents, at a cost Cecilia would have paid heavily in gold
      to have been spared, namely, a public blush. She was allowed to make her
      choice, and she chose the profile, repeating a remark of Mrs. Culling&rsquo;s,
      that it suggested an arrow-head in the upflight; whereupon Mr. Stukely
      Culbrett had said, &lsquo;Then there is the man, for he is undoubtedly a
      projectile&rsquo;; nor were politically-hostile punsters on an arrow-head
      inactive. But Cecilia was thinking of the side-face she (less intently
      than Beauchamp at hers) had glanced at during the drive into Bevisham. At
      that moment, she fancied Madame de Rouaillout might be doing likewise; and
      oh that she had the portrait of the French lady as well!
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day her father tossed her a photograph of another gentleman, coming
      out of a letter he had received from old Mrs. Beauchamp. He asked her
      opinion of it. She said, &lsquo;I think he would have suited Bevisham better
      than Captain Baskelett.&rsquo; Of the original, who presented himself at Mount
      Laurels in the course of the week, she had nothing to say, except that he
      was very like the photograph, very unlike Nevil Beauchamp. &lsquo;Yes, there I&rsquo;m
      of your opinion,&rsquo; her father observed. The gentleman was Mr. Blackburn
      Tuckham, and it was amusing to find an exuberant Tory in one who was the
      reverse of the cavalier type. Nevil and he seemed to have been sorted to
      the wrong sides. Mr. Tuckham had a round head, square flat forehead, and
      ruddy face; he stood as if his feet claimed the earth under them for his
      own, with a certain shortness of leg that detracted from the majesty of
      his resemblance to our Eighth Harry, but increased his air of solidity;
      and he was authoritative in speaking. &lsquo;Let me set you right, sir,&rsquo; he said
      sometimes to Colonel Halkett, and that was his modesty. &lsquo;You are
      altogether wrong,&rsquo; Miss Halkett heard herself informed, which was his
      courtesy. He examined some of her water-colour drawings before sitting
      down to dinner, approved of them, but thought it necessary to lay a broad
      finger on them to show their defects. On the question of politics, &lsquo;I
      venture to state,&rsquo; he remarked, in anything but the tone of a venture,
      &lsquo;that no educated man of ordinary sense who has visited our colonies will
      come back a Liberal.&rsquo; As for a man of sense and education being a Radical,
      he scouted the notion with a pooh sufficient to awaken a vessel in the
      doldrums. He said carelessly of Commander Beauchamp, that he might think
      himself one. Either the Radical candidate for Bevisham stood
      self-deceived, or&mdash;the other supposition. Mr. Tuckham would venture
      to state that no English gentleman, exempt from an examination by order of
      the Commissioners of Lunacy, could be sincerely a Radical. &lsquo;Not a bit of
      it; nonsense,&rsquo; he replied to Miss Halkett&rsquo;s hint at the existence of
      Radical views; &lsquo;that is, those views are out of politics; they are matters
      for the police. Dutch dykes are built to shut away the sea from cultivated
      land, and of course it&rsquo;s a part of the business of the Dutch Government to
      keep up the dykes,&mdash;and of ours to guard against the mob; but that is
      only a political consideration after the mob has been allowed to undermine
      our defences.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They speak,&rsquo; said Miss Halkett, &lsquo;of educating the people to fit them&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They speak of commanding the winds and tides,&rsquo; he cut her short, with no
      clear analogy; &lsquo;wait till we have a storm. It&rsquo;s a delusion amounting to
      dementedness to suppose, that with the people inside our defences, we can
      be taming them and tricking them. As for sending them to school after
      giving them power, it&rsquo;s like asking a wild beast to sit down to dinner
      with us&mdash;he wants the whole table and us too. The best education for
      the people is government. They&rsquo;re beginning to see that in Lancashire at
      last. I ran down to Lancashire for a couple of days on my landing, and I&rsquo;m
      thankful to say Lancashire is preparing to take a step back. Lancashire
      leads the country. Lancashire men see what this Liberalism has done for
      the Labour-market.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Captain Beauchamp considers that the political change coming over the
      minds of the manufacturers is due to the large fortunes they have made,&rsquo; 
      said Miss Halkett, maliciously associating a Radical prophet with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was unaffected by it, and continued: &lsquo;Property is ballast as well as
      treasure. I call property funded good sense. I would give it every
      privilege. If we are to speak of patriotism, I say the possession of
      property guarantees it. I maintain that the lead of men of property is in
      most cases sure to be the safe one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think so,&rsquo; Colonel Halkett interposed, and he spoke as a man of
      property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tuckham grew fervent in his allusions to our wealth and our commerce.
      Having won the race and gained the prize, shall we let it slip out of our
      grasp? Upon this topic his voice descended to tones of priestlike awe: for
      are we not the envy of the world? Our wealth is countless, fabulous. It
      may well inspire veneration. And we have won it with our hands, thanks (he
      implied it so) to our religion. We are rich in money and industry, in
      those two things only, and the corruption of an energetic industry is
      constantly threatened by the profusion of wealth giving it employment.
      This being the case, either your Radicals do not know the first conditions
      of human nature, or they do; and if they do they are traitors, and the
      Liberals opening the gates to them are fools: and some are knaves. We
      perish as a Great Power if we cease to look sharp ahead, hold firm
      together, and make the utmost of what we possess. The word for the
      performance of those duties is Toryism: a word with an older flavour than
      Conservatism, and Mr. Tuckham preferred it. By all means let workmen be
      free men but a man must earn his freedom daily, or he will become a slave
      in some form or another: and the way to earn it is by work and obedience
      to right direction. In a country like ours, open on all sides to the
      competition of intelligence and strength, with a Press that is the voice
      of all parties and of every interest; in a country offering to your
      investments three and a half and more per cent., secure as the firmament!
    </p>
    <p>
      He perceived an amazed expression on Miss Halkett&rsquo;s countenance; and &lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; 
      said he, &lsquo;that means the certainty of food to millions of mouths, and
      comforts, if not luxuries, to half the population. A safe percentage on
      savings is the basis of civilization.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had bruised his eloquence, for though you may start a sermon from
      stones to hit the stars, he must be a practised orator who shall descend
      out of the abstract to take up a heavy lump of the concrete without
      unseating himself, and he stammered and came to a flat ending: &lsquo;In such a
      country&mdash;well, I venture to say, we have a right to condemn in
      advance disturbers of the peace, and they must show very good cause indeed
      for not being summarily held&mdash;to account for their conduct.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The allocution was not delivered in the presence of an audience other than
      sympathetic, and Miss Halkett rightly guessed that it was intended to
      strike Captain Beauchamp by ricochet. He puffed at the mention of
      Beauchamp&rsquo;s name. He had read a reported speech or two of Beauchamp&rsquo;s, and
      shook his head over a quotation of the stuff, as though he would have
      sprung at him like a lion, but for his enrolment as a constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a whit the less did Mr. Tuckham drink his claret relishingly, and he
      told stories incidental to his travels now and then, commended the fishing
      here, the shooting there, and in some few places the cookery, with much
      bright emphasis when it could be praised; it appeared to be an endearing
      recollection to him. Still, as a man of progress, he declared his belief
      that we English would ultimately turn out the best cooks, having
      indubitably the best material. &lsquo;Our incomprehensible political
      pusillanimity&rsquo; was the one sad point about us: we had been driven from
      surrender to surrender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like geese upon a common, I have heard it said,&rsquo; Miss Halkett assisted
      him to Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tuckham laughed, and half yawned and sighed, &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His laughter was catching, and somehow more persuasive of the soundness of
      the man&rsquo;s heart and head than his remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have been astonished to know that a gentleman so uncourtly, if
      not uncouth&mdash;judged by the standard of the circle she moved in&mdash;and
      so unskilled in pleasing the sight and hearing of ladies as to treat them
      like junior comrades, had raised the vow within himself on seeing her:
      You, or no woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel delighted in him, both as a strong and able young fellow, and
      a refreshingly aggressive recruit of his party, who was for onslaught, and
      invoked common sense, instead of waving the flag of sentiment in retreat;
      a very horse-artillery man of Tories. Regretting immensely that Mr.
      Tuckham had not reached England earlier, that he might have occupied the
      seat for Bevisham, about to be given to Captain Baskelett, Colonel Halkett
      set up a contrast of Blackburn Tuckham and Nevil Beauchamp; a singular
      instance of unfairness, his daughter thought, considering that the
      distinct contrast presented by the circumstances was that of Mr. Tuckham
      and Captain Baskelett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems to me, papa,&mdash;that you are contrasting the idealist and the
      realist,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, well, we don&rsquo;t want the idealist in politics,&rsquo; muttered the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Latterly he also had taken to shaking his head over Nevil: Cecilia dared
      not ask him why.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tuckham arrived at Mount Laurels on the eve of the Nomination day in
      Bevisham. An article in the Bevisham Gazette calling upon all true
      Liberals to demonstrate their unanimity by a multitudinous show of hands,
      he ascribed to the writing of a child of Erin; and he was highly diverted
      by the Liberal&rsquo;s hiring of Paddy to &lsquo;pen and spout&rsquo; for him. &lsquo;A Scotchman
      manages, and Paddy does the sermon for all their journals,&rsquo; he said
      off-hand; adding: &lsquo;And the English are the compositors, I suppose.&rsquo; You
      may take that for an instance of the national spirit of Liberal
      newspapers!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; sighed the colonel, as at a case clearly demonstrated against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A drive down to Bevisham to witness the ceremony of the nomination in the
      town-hall sobered Mr. Tuckham&rsquo;s disposition to generalize. Beauchamp had
      the show of hands, and to say with Captain Baskelett, that they were a
      dirty majority, was beneath Mr. Tuckham&rsquo;s verbal antagonism. He fell into
      a studious reserve, noting everything, listening to everybody, greatly to
      Colonel Halkett&rsquo;s admiration of one by nature a talker and a thunderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The show of hands Mr. Seymour Austin declared to be the most delusive of
      electoral auspices; and it proved so. A little later than four o&rsquo;clock in
      the afternoon of the election-day, Cecilia received a message from her
      father telling her that both of the Liberals were headed; &lsquo;Beauchamp
      nowhere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grancey Lespel was the next herald of Beauchamp&rsquo;s defeat. She merely
      stated the fact that she had met the colonel and Mr. Blackburn Tuckham
      driving on the outskirts of the town, and had promised to bring Cecilia
      the final numbers of the poll. Without naming them, she unrolled the
      greater business in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A man who in the middle of an Election goes over to France to fight a
      duel, can hardly expect to win; he has all the morality of an English
      borough opposed to him,&rsquo; she said; and seeing the young lady stiffen: &lsquo;Oh!
      the duel is positive,&rsquo; she dropped her voice. &lsquo;With the husband. Who else
      could it be? And returns invalided. That is evidence. My nephew Palmet has
      it from Vivian Ducie, and he is acquainted with her tolerably intimately,
      and the story is, she was overtaken in her flight in the night, and the
      duel followed at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning; but her brother insisted on
      fighting for Captain Beauchamp, and I cannot tell you how&mdash;but his
      place in it I can&rsquo;t explain&mdash;there was a beau jeune homme, and it&rsquo;s
      quite possible that he should have been the person to stand up against the
      marquis. At any rate, he insulted Captain Beauchamp, or thought your hero
      had insulted him, and the duel was with one or the other. It matters
      exceedingly little with whom, if a duel was fought, and you see we have
      quite established that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope it is not true,&rsquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, that is the Christian thing to do,&rsquo; said Mrs. Lespel. &lsquo;Duelling
      is horrible: though those Romfreys!&mdash;and the Beauchamps were just as
      bad, or nearly. Colonel Richard fought for a friend&rsquo;s wife or sister. But
      in these days duelling is incredible. It was an inhuman practice always,
      and it is now worse&mdash;it is a reach of manners. I would hope it is not
      true; and you may mean that I have it from Lord Palmet. But I know Vivian
      Ducie as well as I know my nephew, and if he distinctly mentions an
      occurrence, we may too surely rely on the truth of it; he is not a man to
      spread mischief. Are you unaware that he met Captain Beauchamp at the
      chateau of the marquise? The whole story was acted under his eyes. He had
      only to take up his pen. Generally he favours me with his French gossip. I
      suppose there were circumstances in this affair more suitable to Palmet
      than to me. He wrote a description of Madame de Rouaillout that set Palmet
      strutting about for an hour. I have no doubt she must be a very beautiful
      woman, for a Frenchwoman: not regular features; expressive, capricious.
      Vivian Ducie lays great stress on her eyes and eyebrows, and, I think, her
      hair. With a Frenchwoman&rsquo;s figure, that is enough to make men crazy. He
      says her husband deserves&mdash;but what will not young men write? It is
      deeply to be regretted that Englishmen abroad&mdash;women the same, I fear&mdash;get
      the Continental tone in morals. But how Captain Beauchamp could expect to
      carry on an Election and an intrigue together, only a head like his can
      tell us. Grancey is in high indignation with him. It does not concern the
      Election, you can imagine. Something that man Dr. Shrapnel has done, which
      he says Captain Beauchamp could have prevented. Quarrels of men! I have
      instructed Palmet to write to Vivian Ducie for a photograph of Madame de
      Rouaillout. Do you know, one has a curiosity to see the face of the woman
      for whom a man ruins himself. But I say again, he ought to be married.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That there may be two victims?&rsquo; Cecilia said it smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was young in suffering, and thought, as the unseasoned and
      inexperienced do, that a mask is a concealment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Married&mdash;settled; to have him bound in honour,&rsquo; said Mrs. Lespel. &lsquo;I
      had a conversation with him when he was at Itchincope; and his look, and
      what I know of his father, that gallant and handsome Colonel Richard
      Beauchamp, would give one a kind of confidence in him; supposing always
      that he is not struck with one of those deadly passions that are like
      snakes, like magic. I positively believe in them. I have seen them. And if
      they end, they end as if the man were burnt out, and was ashes inside; as
      you see Mr. Stukely Culbrett, all cynicism. You would not now suspect him
      of a passion! It is true. Oh, I know it! That is what the men go to. The
      women die. Vera Winter died at twenty-three. Caroline Ormond was hardly
      older. You know her story; everybody knows it. The most singular and
      convincing case was that of Lord Alfred Burnley and Lady Susan Gardiner,
      wife of the general; and there was an instance of two similarly afflicted&mdash;a
      very rare case, most rare: they never could meet to part! It was almost
      ludicrous. It is now quite certain that they did not conspire to meet. At
      last the absolute fatality became so well understood by the persons
      immediately interested&mdash;You laugh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do I laugh?&rsquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We should all know the world, my dear, and you are a strong head. The
      knowledge is only dangerous for fools. And if romance is occasionally
      ridiculous, as I own it can be, humdrum, I protest, is everlastingly so.
      By-the-by, I should have told you that Captain Beauchamp was one hundred
      and ninety below Captain Baskelett when the state of the poll was handed
      to me. The gentleman driving with your father compared the Liberals to a
      parachute cut away from the balloon. Is he army or navy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a barrister, and some cousin of Captain Beauchamp.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should not have taken him for a Beauchamp,&rsquo; said Mrs. Lespel; and,
      resuming her worldly sagacity, &lsquo;I should not like to be in opposition to
      that young man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to have a fancy unexpressed regarding Mr. Tuckham. Reminding
      herself that she might be behind time at Itchincope, where the guests
      would be numerous that evening, and the song of triumph loud, with Captain
      Baskelett to lead it, she kissed the young lady she had unintentionally
      been torturing so long, and drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia hoped it was not true. Her heart sank heavily under the belief
      that it was. She imagined the world abusing Nevil and casting him out, as
      those electors of Bevisham had just done, and impulsively she pleaded for
      him, and became drowned in criminal blushes that forced her to defend
      herself with a determination not to believe the dreadful story, though she
      continued mitigating the wickedness of it; as if, by a singular inversion
      of the fact, her clear good sense excused, and it was her heart that
      condemned him. She dwelt fondly on an image of the &lsquo;gallant and handsome
      Colonel Richard Beauchamp,&rsquo; conjured up in her mind from the fervour of
      Mrs. Lespel when speaking of Nevil&rsquo;s father, whose chivalry threw a light
      on the son&rsquo;s, and whose errors, condoned by time, and with a certain
      brilliancy playing above them, interceded strangely on behalf of Nevil.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. A SHORT SIDELOOK AT THE ELECTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The brisk Election-day, unlike that wearisome but instructive canvass of
      the Englishman in his castle vicatim, teaches little; and its humours are
      those of a badly managed Christmas pantomime without a columbine&mdash;old
      tricks, no graces. Nevertheless, things hang together so that it cannot be
      passed over with a bare statement of the fact of the Liberal-Radical
      defeat in Bevisham: the day was not without fruit in time to come for him
      whom his commiserating admirers of the non-voting sex all round the
      borough called the poor dear commander. Beauchamp&rsquo;s holiday out of England
      had incited Dr. Shrapnel to break a positive restriction put upon him by
      Jenny Denham, and actively pursue the canvass and the harangue in person;
      by which conduct, as Jenny had foreseen, many temperate electors were
      alienated from Commander Beauchamp, though no doubt the Radicals were made
      compact: for they may be the skirmishing faction&mdash;poor scattered
      fragments, none of them sufficiently downright for the other; each
      outstripping each; rudimentary emperors, elementary prophets, inspired
      physicians, nostrum-devouring patients, whatsoever you will; and still
      here and there a man shall arise to march them in close columns, if they
      can but trust him; in perfect subordination, a model even for Tories while
      they keep shoulder to shoulder. And to behold such a disciplined body is
      intoxicating to the eye of a leader accustomed to count ahead upon
      vapourish abstractions, and therefore predisposed to add a couple of
      noughts to every tangible figure in his grasp. Thus will a realized fifty
      become five hundred or five thousand to him: the very sense of number is
      instinct with multiplication in his mind; and those years far on in
      advance, which he has been looking to with some fatigue to the optics,
      will suddenly and rollickingly roll up to him at the shutting of his eyes
      in a temporary fit of gratification. So, by looking and by not looking, he
      achieves his phantom victory&mdash;embraces his cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Shrapnel conceived that the day was to be a Radical success; and he, a
      citizen aged and exercised in reverses, so rounded by the habit of them
      indeed as to tumble and recover himself on the wind of the blow that
      struck him, was, it must be acknowledged, staggered and cast down when he
      saw Beauchamp drop, knowing full well his regiment had polled to a man.
      Radicals poll early; they would poll at cockcrow if they might; they dance
      on the morning. As for their chagrin at noon, you will find descriptions
      of it in the poet&rsquo;s Inferno. They are for lifting our clay soil on a lever
      of Archimedes, and are not great mathematicians. They have perchance a
      foot of our earth, and perpetually do they seem to be producing an effect,
      perpetually does the whole land roll back on them. You have not surely to
      be reminded that it hurts them; the weight is immense. Dr. Shrapnel,
      however, speedily looked out again on his vast horizon, though prostrate.
      He regained his height of stature with no man&rsquo;s help. Success was but
      postponed for a generation or two. Is it so very distant? Gaze on it with
      the eye of our parent orb! &lsquo;I shall not see it here; you may,&rsquo; he said to
      Jenny Denham; and he fortified his outlook by saying to Mr. Lydiard that
      the Tories of our time walked, or rather stuck, in the track of the
      Radicals of a generation back. Note, then, that Radicals, always marching
      to the triumph, never taste it; and for Tories it is Dead Sea fruit, ashes
      in their mouths! Those Liberals, those temporisers, compromisers, a
      concourse of atoms! glorify themselves in the animal satisfaction of
      sucking the juice of the fruit, for which they pay with their souls. They
      have no true cohesion, for they have no vital principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lydiard being a Liberal, bade the doctor not to forget the work of the
      Liberals, who touched on Tory and Radical with a pretty steady swing, from
      side to side, in the manner of the pendulum of a clock, which is the
      clock&rsquo;s life, remember that. The Liberals are the professors of the
      practicable in politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A suitable image for time-servers!&rsquo; Dr. Shrapnel exclaimed, intolerant of
      any mention of the Liberals as a party, especially in the hour of Radical
      discomfiture, when the fact that compromisers should exist exasperates men
      of a principle. &lsquo;Your Liberals are the band of Pyrrhus, an army of
      bastards, mercenaries professing the practicable for pay. They know us the
      motive force, the Tories the resisting power, and they feign to aid us in
      battering our enemy, that they may stop the shock. We fight, they profit.
      What are they? Stranded Whigs, crotchetty manufacturers; dissentient
      religionists; the half-minded, the hare-hearted; the I would and I
      would-not&mdash;shifty creatures, with youth&rsquo;s enthusiasm decaying in
      them, and a purse beginning to jingle; fearing lest we do too much for
      safety, our enemy not enough for safety. They a party? Let them take
      action and see! We stand a thousand defeats; they not one! Compromise
      begat them. Once let them leave sucking the teats of compromise, yea, once
      put on the air of men who fight and die for a cause, they fly to pieces.
      And whither the fragments? Chiefly, my friend, into the Tory ranks.
      Seriously so I say. You between future and past are for the present&mdash;but
      with the hunted look behind of all godless livers in the present. You
      Liberals are Tories with foresight, Radicals without faith. You start, in
      fear of Toryism, on an errand of Radicalism, and in fear of Radicalism to
      Toryism you draw back. There is your pendulum-swing!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lectures to this effect were delivered by Dr. Shrapnel throughout the day,
      for his private spiritual solace it may be supposed, unto Lydiard, Turbot,
      Beauchamp, or whomsoever the man chancing to be near him, and never did
      Sir Oracle wear so extraordinary a garb. The favourite missiles of the day
      were flour-bags. Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s uncommon height, and his outrageous long
      brown coat, would have been sufficient to attract them, without the
      reputation he had for desiring to subvert everything old English. The
      first discharges gave him the appearance of a thawing snowman. Drenchings
      of water turned the flour to ribs of paste, and in colour at least he
      looked legitimately the cook&rsquo;s own spitted hare, escaped from her basting
      ladle, elongated on two legs. It ensued that whenever he was caught sight
      of, as he walked unconcernedly about, the young street-professors of the
      decorative arts were seized with a frenzy to add their share to the
      whitening of him, until he might have been taken for a miller that had
      gone bodily through his meal. The popular cry proclaimed him a ghost, and
      he walked like one, impassive, blanched, and silent amid the uproar of
      mobs of jolly ruffians, for each of whom it was a point of honour to have
      a shy at old Shrapnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clad in this preparation of pie-crust, he called from time to time at
      Beauchamp&rsquo;s hotel, and renewed his monologue upon that Radical empire in
      the future which was for ever in the future for the pioneers of men, yet
      not the less their empire. &lsquo;Do we live in our bodies?&rsquo; quoth he, replying
      to his fiery interrogation: &lsquo;Ay, the Tories! the Liberals!&rsquo; They lived in
      their bodies. Not one syllable of personal consolation did he vouchsafe to
      Beauchamp. He did not imagine it could be required by a man who had bathed
      in the pure springs of Radicalism; and it should be remarked that
      Beauchamp deceived him by imitating his air of happy abstraction, or
      subordination of the faculties to a distant view, comparable to a ship&rsquo;s
      crew in difficulties receiving the report of the man at the masthead.
      Beauchamp deceived Miss Denham too, and himself, by saying, as if he
      cherished the philosophy of defeat, besides the resolution to fight on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only a skirmish lost, and that counts for nothing in a battle
      without end: it must be incessant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But does incessant battling keep the intellect clear?&rsquo; was her memorable
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at Lydiard, to indicate that it came of that gentleman&rsquo;s
      influence upon her mind. It was impossible for him to think that women
      thought. The idea of a pretty woman exercising her mind independently, and
      moreover moving him to examine his own, made him smile. Could a
      sweet-faced girl, the nearest to Renee in grace of manner and in feature
      of all women known to him, originate a sentence that would set him
      reflecting? He was unable to forget it, though he allowed her no credit
      for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, his admiration of her devotedness to Dr. Shrapnel was
      unbounded. There shone a strictly feminine quality! according to the
      romantic visions of the sex entertained by Commander Beauchamp, and by
      others who would be the objects of it. But not alone the passive virtues
      were exhibited by Jenny Denham: she proved that she had high courage. No
      remonstrance could restrain Dr. Shrapnel from going out to watch the
      struggle, and she went with him as a matter of course on each occasion.
      Her dress bore witness to her running the gauntlet beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was not thrown at me purposely,&rsquo; she said, to quiet Beauchamp&rsquo;s wrath.
      She saved the doctor from being rough mobbed. Once when they were
      surrounded she fastened his arm under hers, and by simply moving on with
      an unswerving air of serenity obtained a passage for him. So much did she
      make herself respected, that the gallant rascals became emulous in
      dexterity to avoid powdering her, by loudly execrating any but dead shots
      at the detested one, and certain boys were maltreated for an ardour
      involving clumsiness. A young genius of this horde conceiving, in the
      spirit of the inventors of our improved modern ordnance, that it was vain
      to cast missiles which left a thing standing, hurled a stone wrapped in
      paper. It missed its mark. Jenny said nothing about it. The day closed
      with a comfortable fight or two in by-quarters of the town, probably to
      prove that an undaunted English spirit, spite of fickle Fortune, survived
      in our muscles.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. TOUCHING A YOUNG LADY&rsquo;S HEART AND HER INTELLECT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Tuckham found his way to Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s cottage to see his kinsman on
      the day after the election. There was a dinner in honour of the Members
      for Bevisham at Mount Laurels in the evening, and he was five minutes
      behind military time when he entered the restive drawing-room and stood
      before the colonel. No sooner had he stated that he had been under the
      roof of Dr. Shrapnel, than his unpunctuality was immediately overlooked in
      the burst of impatience evoked by the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That pestilent fellow!&rsquo; Colonel Halkett ejaculated. &lsquo;I understand he has
      had the impudence to serve a notice on Grancey Lespel about encroachments
      on common land.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one described Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s appearance under the flour storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He deserves anything,&rsquo; said the colonel, consulting his mantelpiece
      clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Baskelett observed: &lsquo;I shall have my account to settle with Dr.
      Shrapnel.&rsquo; He spoke like a man having a right to be indignant, but
      excepting that the doctor had bestowed nicknames upon him in a speech at a
      meeting, no one could discover the grounds for it. He nodded briefly. A
      Radical apple had struck him on the left cheekbone as he performed his
      triumphal drive through the town, and a slight disfigurement remained, to
      which his hand was applied sympathetically at intervals, for the
      cheek-bone was prominent in his countenance, and did not well bear
      enlargement. And when a fortunate gentleman, desiring to be still more
      fortunate, would display the winning amiability of his character,
      distension of one cheek gives him an afflictingly false look of sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bent of his mind, nevertheless, was to please Miss Halkett. He would
      be smiling, and intimately smiling. Aware that she had a kind of pitiful
      sentiment for Nevil, he smiled over Nevil&mdash;poor Nevil! &lsquo;I give you my
      word, Miss Halkett, old Nevil was off his head yesterday. I daresay he
      meant to be civil. I met him; I called out to him, &ldquo;Good day, cousin, I&rsquo;m
      afraid you&rsquo;re beaten&rdquo; and says he, &ldquo;I fancy you&rsquo;ve gained it, uncle.&rdquo; He
      didn&rsquo;t know where he was; all abroad, poor boy. Uncle!&mdash;to me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Halkett would have accepted the instance for a proof of Nevil&rsquo;s
      distraction, had not Mr. Seymour Austin, who sat beside her, laughed and
      said to her: &lsquo;I suppose &ldquo;uncle&rdquo; was a chance shot, but it&rsquo;s equal to a
      poetic epithet in the light it casts on the story.&rsquo; Then it seemed to her
      that Nevil had been keenly quick, and Captain Baskelett&rsquo;s impenetrability
      was a sign of his density. Her mood was to think Nevil Beauchamp only too
      quick, too adventurous and restless: one that wrecked brilliant gifts in a
      too general warfare; a lover of hazards, a hater of laws. Her eyes flew
      over Captain Baskelett as she imagined Nevil addressing him as uncle, and,
      to put aside a spirit of mockery rising within her, she hinted a wish to
      hear Seymour Austin&rsquo;s opinion of Mr. Tuckham. He condensed it in an
      interrogative tone: &lsquo;The other extreme?&rsquo; The Tory extreme of Radical Nevil
      Beauchamp. She assented. Mr. Tuckham was at that moment prophesying the
      Torification of mankind; not as the trembling venturesome idea which we
      cast on doubtful winds, but as a ship is launched to ride the waters, with
      huzzas for a thing accomplished. Mr. Austin raised his shoulders
      imperceptibly, saying to Miss Halkett: &lsquo;The turn will come to us as to
      others&mdash;and go. Nothing earthly can escape that revolution. We have
      to meet it with a policy, and let it pass with measures carried and our
      hands washed of some of our party sins. I am, I hope, true to my party,
      but the enthusiasm of party I do not share. He is right, however, when he
      accuses the nation of cowardice for the last ten years. One third of the
      Liberals have been with us at heart, and dared not speak, and we dared not
      say what we wished. We accepted a compact that satisfied us both&mdash;satisfied
      us better than when we were opposed by Whigs&mdash;that is, the Liberal
      reigned, and we governed: and I should add, a very clever juggler was our
      common chief. Now we have the consequences of hollow peacemaking, in a
      suffrage that bids fair to extend to the wearing of hats and boots for a
      qualification. The moral of it seems to be that cowardice is even worse
      for nations than for individual men, though the consequences come on us
      more slowly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You spoke of party sins,&rsquo; Miss Halkett said incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall think we are the redoubtable party when we admit the charge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you alluding to the landowners?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like the land itself, they have rich veins in heavy matter. For instance,
      the increasing wealth of the country is largely recruiting our ranks; and
      we shall be tempted to mistake numbers for strength, and perhaps again be
      reading Conservatism for a special thing of our own&mdash;a fortification.
      That would be a party sin. Conservatism is a principle of government; the
      best because the safest for an old country; and the guarantee that we do
      not lose the wisdom of past experience in our struggle with what is
      doubtful. Liberalism stakes too much on the chance of gain. It is
      uncomfortably seated on half-a-dozen horses; and it has to feed them too,
      and on varieties of corn.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; Miss Halkett said, pausing, &lsquo;and I know you would not talk down to
      me, but the use of imagery makes me feel that I am addressed as a
      primitive intelligence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the fault of my trying at condensation, as the hieroglyphists put
      an animal for a paragraph. I am incorrigible, you see; but the lecture in
      prose must be for by-and-by, if you care to have it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you care to read it to me. Did a single hieroglyphic figure stand for
      so much?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have never deciphered one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been speaking to me too long in earnest, Mr. Austin!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I accept the admonition, though it is wider than the truth. Have you ever
      consented to listen to politics before?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia reddened faintly, thinking of him who had taught her to listen,
      and of her previous contempt of the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      A political exposition devoid of imagery was given to her next day on the
      sunny South-western terrace of Mount Laurels, when it was only by mentally
      translating it into imagery that she could advance a step beside her
      intellectual guide; and she was ashamed of the volatility of her ideas.
      She was constantly comparing Mr. Austin and Nevil Beauchamp, seeing that
      the senior and the junior both talked to her with the familiar recognition
      of her understanding which was a compliment without the gross corporeal
      phrase. But now she made another discovery, that should have been
      infinitely more of a compliment, and it was bewildering, if not repulsive
      to her:&mdash;could it be credited? Mr. Austin was a firm believer in new
      and higher destinies for women. He went farther than she could concede the
      right of human speculation to go; he was, in fact, as Radical there as
      Nevil Beauchamp politically; and would not the latter innovator stare,
      perchance frown conservatively, at a prospect of woman taking counsel, in
      council, with men upon public affairs, like the women in the Germania! Mr.
      Austin, if this time he talked in earnest, deemed that Englishwomen were
      on the road to win such a promotion, and would win it ultimately. He said
      soberly that he saw more certain indications of the reality of progress
      among women than any at present shown by men. And he was professedly
      temperate. He was but for opening avenues to the means of livelihood for
      them, and leaving it to their strength to conquer the position they might
      wish to win. His belief that they would do so was the revolutionary sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are there points of likeness between Radicals and Tories?&rsquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suspect a cousinship in extremes,&rsquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If one might be present at an argument,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have only to meet to fly apart as wide as the Poles,&rsquo; Mr. Austin
      rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had not spoken of a particular person to meet him; and how, then,
      had she betrayed herself? She fancied he looked unwontedly arch as he
      resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The end of the argument would see us each entrenched in his party.
      Suppose me to be telling your Radical friend such truisms as that we
      English have not grown in a day, and were not originally made free and
      equal by decree; that we have grown, and must continue to grow, by the aid
      and the development of our strength; that ours is a fairly legible
      history, and a fair example of the good and the bad in human growth; that
      his landowner and his peasant have no clear case of right and wrong to
      divide them, one being the descendant of strong men, the other of weak
      ones; and that the former may sink, the latter may rise&mdash;there is no
      artificial obstruction; and if it is difficult to rise, it is easy to
      sink. Your Radical friend, who would bring them to a level by
      proclamation, could not adopt a surer method for destroying the manhood of
      a people: he is for doctoring wooden men, and I for not letting our stout
      English be cut down short as Laplanders; he would have them in a forcing
      house, and I in open air, as hitherto. Do you perceive a discussion? and
      you apprehend the nature of it. We have nerves. That is why it is better
      for men of extremely opposite opinions not to meet. I dare say Radicalism
      has a function, and so long as it respects the laws I am ready to
      encounter it where it cannot be avoided. Pardon my prosing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Recommend me some hard books to study through the Winter,&rsquo; said Cecilia,
      refreshed by a discourse that touched no emotions, as by a febrifuge.
      Could Nevil reply to it? She fancied him replying, with that wild head of
      his&mdash;wildest of natures. She fancied also that her wish was like Mr.
      Austin&rsquo;s not to meet him. She was enjoying a little rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not quite generous in Mr. Austin to assume that &lsquo;her Radical
      friend&rsquo; had been prompting her. However, she thanked him in her heart for
      the calm he had given her. To be able to imagine Nevil Beauchamp
      intellectually erratic was a tonic satisfaction to the proud young lady,
      ashamed of a bondage that the bracing and pointing of her critical powers
      helped her to forget. She had always preferred the society of men of Mr.
      Austin&rsquo;s age. How old was he? Her father would know. And why was he
      unmarried? A light frost had settled on the hair about his temples; his
      forehead was lightly wrinkled; but his mouth and smile, and his eyes, were
      lively as a young man&rsquo;s, with more in them. His age must be something less
      than fifty. O for peace! she sighed. When he stepped into his carriage,
      and stood up in it to wave adieu to her, she thought his face and figure a
      perfect example of an English gentleman in his prime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Baskelett requested the favour of five minutes of conversation
      with Miss Halkett before he followed Mr. Austin, on his way to Steynham.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned from that colloquy to her father and Mr. Tuckham. The colonel
      looked straight in her face, with an elevation of the brows. To these
      points of interrogation she answered with a placid fall of her eyelids. He
      sounded a note of approbation in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the company having departed, Mr. Tuckham for the first time spoke of
      his interview with his kinsman Beauchamp. Yesterday evening he had slurred
      it, as if he had nothing to relate, except the finding of an old
      schoolfellow at Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s named Lydiard, a man of ability fool enough
      to have turned author on no income. But that which had appeared to Miss
      Halkett a want of observancy, became attributable to depth of character on
      its being clear that he had waited for the departure of the transient
      guests of the house, to pour forth his impressions without holding up his
      kinsman to public scorn. He considered Shrapnel mad and Beauchamp mad. No
      such grotesque old monster as Dr. Shrapnel had he seen in the course of
      his travels. He had never listened to a madman running loose who was at
      all up to Beauchamp. At a loss for words to paint him, he said: &lsquo;Beauchamp
      seems to have a head like a firework manufactory, he&rsquo;s perfectly
      pyrocephalic.&rsquo; For an example of Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s talk: &lsquo;I happened,&rsquo; said
      Mr. Tuckham, &lsquo;casually, meaning no harm, and not supposing I was throwing
      a lighted match on powder, to mention the word Providence. I found myself
      immediately confronted by Shrapnel&mdash;overtopped, I should say. He is a
      lank giant of about seven feet in height; the kind of show man that used
      to go about in caravans over the country; and he began rocking over me
      like a poplar in a gale, and cries out: &ldquo;Stay there! away with that!
      Providence? Can you set a thought on Providence, not seeking to propitiate
      it? And have you not there the damning proof that you are at the foot of
      an Idol?&rdquo;&mdash;The old idea about a special Providence, I suppose. These
      fellows have nothing new but their trimmings. And he went on with: &ldquo;Ay,
      invisible,&rdquo; and his arm chopping, &ldquo;but an Idol! an Idol!&rdquo;&mdash;I was to
      think of &ldquo;nought but Laws.&rdquo; He admitted there might be one above the Laws.
      &ldquo;To realize him is to fry the brains in their pan,&rdquo; says he, and struck
      his forehead&mdash;a slap: and off he walked down the garden, with his
      hands at his coat-tails. I venture to say it may be taken for a proof of
      incipient insanity to care to hear such a fellow twice. And Beauchamp
      holds him up for a sage and a prophet!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a very dangerous dog,&rsquo; said Colonel Halkett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The best of it is&mdash;and I take this for the strongest possible proof
      that Beauchamp is mad&mdash;Shrapnel stands for an advocate of morality
      against him. I&rsquo;ll speak of it....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tuckham nodded to the colonel, who said: &lsquo;Speak out. My daughter has
      been educated for a woman of the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir, it&rsquo;s nothing to offend a young lady&rsquo;s ears. Beauchamp is for
      socially enfranchising the sex&mdash;that is all. Quite enough. Not a whit
      politically. Love is to be the test: and if a lady ceases to love her
      husband... if she sets her fancy elsewhere, she&rsquo;s bound to leave him. The
      laws are tyrannical, our objections are cowardly. Well, this Dr. Shrapnel
      harangued about society; and men as well as women are to sacrifice their
      passions on that altar. If he could burlesque himself it would be in
      coming out as a cleric&mdash;the old Pagan!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did he convince Captain Beauchamp?&rsquo; the colonel asked, manifestly for his
      daughter to hear the reply; which was: &lsquo;Oh dear, no!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Were you able to gather from Captain Beauchamp&rsquo;s remarks whether he is
      much disappointed by the result of the election?&rsquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tuckham could tell her only that Captain Beauchamp was incensed
      against an elector named Tomlinson for withdrawing a promised vote on
      account of lying rumours, and elated by the conquest of a Mr. Carpendike,
      who was reckoned a tough one to drag by the neck. &lsquo;The only sane people in
      the house are a Miss Denham and the cook: I lunched there,&rsquo; Mr. Tuckham
      nodded approvingly. &lsquo;Lydiard must be mad. What he&rsquo;s wasting his time there
      for I can&rsquo;t guess. He says he&rsquo;s engaged there in writing a prefatory essay
      to a new publication of Harry Denham&rsquo;s poems&mdash;whoever that may be.
      And why wasting it there? I don&rsquo;t like it. He ought to be earning his
      bread. He&rsquo;ll be sure to be borrowing money by-and-by. We&rsquo;ve got ten
      thousand too many fellows writing already, and they &lsquo;ve seen a few inches
      of the world, on the Continent! He can write. But it&rsquo;s all
      unproductive-dead weight on the country, these fellows with their
      writings! He says Beauchamp&rsquo;s praise of Miss Denham is quite deserved. He
      tells me, that at great peril to herself&mdash;and she nearly had her arm
      broken by a stone he saved Shrapnel from rough usage on the election-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hum!&rsquo; Colonel Halkett grunted significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I thought,&rsquo; Mr. Tuckham responded. &lsquo;One doesn&rsquo;t want the man to be
      hurt, but he ought to be put down in some way. My belief is he&rsquo;s a
      Fire-worshipper. I warrant I would extinguish him if he came before me.
      He&rsquo;s an incendiary, at any rate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think,&rsquo; said Cecilia, &lsquo;that Captain Beauchamp is now satisfied
      with his experience of politics?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me, no,&rsquo; said Mr. Tuckham. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the opening of a campaign. He&rsquo;s off
      to the North, after he has been to Sussex and Bucks. He&rsquo;s to be at it all
      his life. One thing he shows common sense in. If I heard him once I heard
      him say half-a-dozen times, that he must have money:&mdash;&ldquo;I must have
      money!&rdquo; And so he must if he &lsquo;s to head the Radicals. He wants to start a
      newspaper! Is he likely to get money from his uncle Romfrey?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not for his present plan of campaign.&rsquo; Colonel Halkett enunciated the
      military word sarcastically. &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s hope he won&rsquo;t get money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He says he must have it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is to stand and deliver, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I only repeat what he says: unless he has an eye on my Aunt
      Beauchamp; and I doubt his luck there, if he wants money for political
      campaigning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Money!&rsquo; Colonel Halkett ejaculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      That word too was in the heart of the heiress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevil must have money! Could he have said it? Ordinary men might say or
      think it inoffensively; Captain Baskelett, for instance: but not Nevil
      Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Baskelett, as she had conveyed the information to her father for
      his comfort in the dumb domestic language familiar between them on these
      occasions, had proposed to her unavailingly. Italian and English gentlemen
      were in the list of her rejected suitors: and hitherto she had seen them
      come and go, one might say, from a watchtower in the skies. None of them
      was the ideal she waited for: what their feelings were, their wishes,
      their aims, she had not reflected on. They dotted the landscape beneath
      the unassailable heights, busy after their fashion, somewhat quaint, much
      like the pigmy husbandmen in the fields were to the giant&rsquo;s daughter, who
      had more curiosity than Cecilia. But Nevil Beauchamp had compelled her to
      quit her lofty station, pulled her low as the littlest of women that throb
      and flush at one man&rsquo;s footstep: and being well able to read the nature
      and aspirations of Captain Baskelett, it was with the knowledge of her
      having been proposed to as heiress of a great fortune that she chanced to
      hear of Nevil&rsquo;s resolve to have money. If he did say it! And was anything
      likelier? was anything unlikelier? His foreign love denied to him, why,
      now he devoted himself to money: money&mdash;the last consideration of a
      man so single-mindedly generous as he! But he must have money to pursue
      his contest! But would he forfeit the truth in him for money for any
      purpose?
    </p>
    <p>
      The debate on this question grew as incessant as the thought of him. Was
      it not to be supposed that the madness of the pursuit of his political
      chimaera might change his character?
    </p>
    <p>
      She hoped he would not come to Mount Laurels, thinking she should esteem
      him less if he did; knowing that her defence of him, on her own behalf,
      against herself, depended now on an esteem lodged perhaps in her
      wilfulness. Yet if he did not come, what an Arctic world!
    </p>
    <p>
      He came on a November afternoon when the woods glowed, and no sun. The day
      was narrowed in mist from earth to heaven: a moveless and possessing mist.
      It left space overhead for one wreath of high cloud mixed with touches of
      washed red upon moist blue, still as the mist, insensibly passing into it.
      Wet webs crossed the grass, chill in the feeble light. The last flowers of
      the garden bowed to decay. Dead leaves, red and brown and spotted yellow,
      fell straight around the stems of trees, lying thick. The glow was
      universal, and the chill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia sat sketching the scene at a window of her study, on the level of
      the drawing-room, and he stood by outside till she saw him. He greeted her
      through the glass, then went round to the hall door, giving her time to
      recover, if only her heart had been less shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their meeting was like the features of the day she set her brush to
      picture: characteristic of a season rather than cheerless in tone, though
      it breathed little cheer. Is there not a pleasure in contemplating that
      which is characteristic? Her unfinished sketch recalled him after he had
      gone: he lived in it, to startle her again, and bid her heart gallop and
      her cheeks burn. The question occurred to her: May not one love, not
      craving to be beloved? Such a love does not sap our pride, but supports
      it; increases rather than diminishes our noble self-esteem. To attain such
      a love the martyrs writhed up to the crown of saints. For a while Cecilia
      revelled in the thought that she could love in this most saint-like
      manner. How they fled, the sordid ideas of him which accused him of the
      world&rsquo;s one passion, and were transferred to her own bosom in reproach
      that she should have imagined them existing in his! He talked simply and
      sweetly of his defeat, of time wasted away from the canvass, of loss of
      money: and he had little to spare, he said. The water-colour drawing
      interested him. He said he envied her that power of isolation, and the eye
      for beauty in every season. She opened a portfolio of Mr. Tuckham&rsquo;s
      water-colour drawings in every clime; scenes of Europe, Asia, and the
      Americas; and he was to be excused for not caring to look through them.
      His remark, that they seemed hard and dogged, was not so unjust, she
      thought, smiling to think of the critic criticized. His wonderment that a
      young man like his Lancastrian cousin should be &lsquo;an unmitigated Tory&rsquo; was
      perhaps natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia said, &lsquo;Yet I cannot discern in him a veneration for aristocracy.&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not wanted for modern Toryism,&rsquo; said Nevil. &lsquo;One may venerate old
      families when they show the blood of the founder, and are not dead wood. I
      do. And I believe the blood of the founder, though the man may have been a
      savage and a robber, had in his day finer elements in it than were common.
      But let me say at a meeting that I respect true aristocracy, I hear a
      growl and a hiss beginning: why? Don&rsquo;t judge them hastily: because the
      people have seen the aristocracy opposed to the cause that was weak, and
      only submitting to it when it commanded them to resist at their peril;
      clinging to traditions, and not anywhere standing for humanity: much more
      a herd than the people themselves. Ah! well, we won&rsquo;t talk of it now. I
      say that is no aristocracy, if it does not head the people in virtue&mdash;military,
      political, national: I mean the qualities required by the times for
      leadership. I won&rsquo;t bother you with my ideas now. I love to see you
      paint-brush in hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brush trembled on the illumination of a scarlet maple. &lsquo;In this
      country we were not originally made free and equal by decree, Nevil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and I cast no blame on our farthest ancestors.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It struck her that this might be an outline of a reply to Mr. Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you have been thinking over it?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not to conclusions,&rsquo; she said, trying to retain in her mind the
      evanescent suggestiveness of his previous remark, and vexed to find
      herself upon nothing but a devious phosphorescent trail there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her forehead betrayed the unwonted mental action. He cried out for pardon.
      &lsquo;What right have I to bother you? I see it annoys you. The truth is, I
      came for peace. I think of you when they talk of English homes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt then that he was comparing her home with another, a foreign home.
      After he had gone she felt that there had been a comparison of two
      persons. She remembered one of his observations: &lsquo;Few women seem to have
      courage&rsquo;; when his look at her was for an instant one of scrutiny or
      calculation. Under a look like that we perceive that we are being weighed.
      She had no clue to tell her what it signified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glorious and solely glorious love, that has risen above emotion, quite
      independent of craving! That is to be the bird of upper air, poised on his
      wings. It is a home in the sky. Cecilia took possession of it
      systematically, not questioning whether it would last; like one who is too
      enamoured of the habitation to object to be a tenant-at-will. If it was
      cold, it was in recompense immeasurably lofty, a star-girdled place; and
      dwelling in it she could avow to herself the secret which was now working
      self-deception, and still preserve her pride unwounded. Her womanly pride,
      she would have said in vindication of it: but Cecilia Halkett&rsquo;s pride went
      far beyond the merely womanly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus she was assisted to endure a journey down to Wales, where Nevil would
      surely not be. She passed a Winter without seeing him. She returned to
      Mount Laurels from London at Easter, and went on a visit to Steynham, and
      back to London, having sight of him nowhere, still firm in the thought
      that she loved ethereally, to bless, forgive, direct, encourage, pray for
      him, impersonally. She read certain speeches delivered by Nevil at
      assemblies of Liberals or Radicals, which were reported in papers in the
      easy irony of the style of here and there a sentence, here and there a
      summary: salient quotations interspersed with running abstracts: a style
      terrible to friends of the speaker so reported, overwhelming if they
      differ in opinion: yet her charity was a match for it. She was obliged to
      have recourse to charity, it should be observed. Her father drew her
      attention to the spectacle of R. C. S. Nevil Beauchamp, Commander R.N.,
      fighting those reporters with letters in the newspapers, and the dry
      editorial comment flanked by three stars on the left. He was shocked to
      see a gentleman writing such letters to the papers. &lsquo;But one thing hangs
      on another,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you seem angry with Nevil, papa,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do hate a turbulent, restless fellow, my dear,&rsquo; the colonel burst out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa, he has really been unfairly reported.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia laid three privately-printed full reports of Commander Beauchamp&rsquo;s
      speeches (very carefully corrected by him) before her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      He suffered his eye to run down a page. &lsquo;Is it possible you read this?&mdash;this
      trash!&mdash;dangerous folly, I call it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia&rsquo;s reply, &lsquo;In the interests of justice, I do,&rsquo; was meant to express
      her pure impartiality. By a toleration of what is detested we expose
      ourselves to the keenness of an adverse mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does he write to you, too?&rsquo; said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered: &lsquo;Oh, no; I am not a politician.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He seems to have expected you to read those tracts of his, though.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I think he would convert me if he could,&rsquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Though you&rsquo;re not a politician.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He relies on the views he delivers in public, rather than on writing to
      persuade; that was my meaning, papa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said the colonel, not caring to show his anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tuckham dined with them frequently in London. This gentleman betrayed
      his accomplishments one by one. He sketched, and was no artist; he
      planted, and was no gardener; he touched the piano neatly, and was no
      musician; he sang, and he had no voice. Apparently he tried his hand at
      anything, for the privilege of speaking decisively upon all things. He
      accompanied the colonel and his daughter on a day&rsquo;s expedition to Mrs.
      Beauchamp, on the Upper Thames, and they agreed that he shone to great
      advantage in her society. Mrs. Beauchamp said she had seen her
      great-nephew Nevil, but without a comment on his conduct or his person;
      grave silence. Reflecting on it, Cecilia grew indignant at the thought
      that Mr. Tuckham might have been acting a sinister part. Mrs. Beauchamp
      alluded to a newspaper article of her favourite great-nephew Blackburn,
      written, Cecilia knew through her father, to controvert some tremendous
      proposition of Nevil&rsquo;s. That was writing, Mrs. Beauchamp said. &lsquo;I am not
      in the habit of fearing a conflict, so long as we have stout defenders. I
      rather like it,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel entertained Mrs. Beauchamp, while Mr. Tuckham led Miss Halkett
      over the garden. Cecilia considered that his remarks upon Nevil were
      insolent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seriously, Miss Halkett, to take him at his best, he is a very good
      fellow, I don&rsquo;t doubt; I am told so; and a capital fellow among men, a
      good friend and not a bad boon-fellow, and for that matter, the
      smoking-room is a better test than the drawing-room; all he wants is
      emphatically school&mdash;school&mdash;school. I have recommended the
      simple iteration of that one word in answer to him at his meetings, and
      the printing of it as a foot-note to his letters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia&rsquo;s combative spirit precipitated her to say, &lsquo;I hear the mob in it
      shouting Captain Beauchamp down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said Mr. Tuckham, &lsquo;it would be setting the mob to shout wisely at
      last.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The mob is a wild beast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then we should hear wisdom coming out of the mouth of the wild beast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Men have the phrase, &ldquo;fair play.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fair play, I say, is not applicable to a man who deliberately goes about
      to stir the wild beast. He is laughed at, plucked, hustled, and robbed, by
      those who deafen him with their &ldquo;plaudits&rdquo;&mdash;their roars. Did you see
      his advertisement of a great-coat, lost at some rapscallion gathering down
      in the North, near my part of the country? A great-coat and a packet of
      letters. He offers a reward of L10. But that&rsquo;s honest robbery compared
      with the bleeding he&rsquo;ll get.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know Mr. Seymour Austin?&rsquo; Miss Halkett asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I met him once at your father&rsquo;s table. Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you would like to listen to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, my fault is not listening enough,&rsquo; said Mr. Tuckham.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was capable of receiving correction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father told her he was indebted to Mr. Tuckham past payment in coin,
      for services rendered by him on a trying occasion among the miners in
      Wales during the first spring month. &lsquo;I dare say he can speak effectively
      to miners,&rsquo; Cecilia said, outvying the contemptuous young man in
      superciliousness, but with effort and not with satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      She left London in July, two days before her father could be induced to
      return to Mount Laurels. Feverish, and strangely subject to caprices now,
      she chose the longer way round by Sussex, and alighted at the station near
      Steynham to call on Mrs. Culling, whom she knew to be at the Hall,
      preparing it for Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s occupation. In imitation of her father she
      was Rosamund&rsquo;s fast friend, though she had never quite realized her
      position, and did not thoroughly understand her. Would it not please her
      father to hear that she had chosen the tedious route for the purpose of
      visiting this lady, whose champion he was?
    </p>
    <p>
      So she went to Steynham, and for hours she heard talk of no one, of
      nothing, but her friend Nevil. Cecilia was on her guard against Rosamund&rsquo;s
      defence of his conduct in France. The declaration that there had been no
      misbehaviour at all could not be accepted; but the news of Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s
      having installed Nevil in Holdesbury to manage that property, and of his
      having mooted to her father the question of an alliance between her and
      Nevil, was wonderful. Rosamund could not say what answer her father had
      made: hardly favourable, Cecilia supposed, since he had not spoken of the
      circumstance to her. But Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s influence with him would certainly
      be powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to be assumed, also, that Nevil had been consulted by his uncle.
      Rosamund said full-heartedly that this alliance had for years been her
      life&rsquo;s desire, and then she let the matter pass, nor did she once loop at
      Cecilia searchingly, or seem to wish to probe her. Cecilia disagreed with
      Rosamund on an insignificant point in relation to something Mr. Romfrey
      and Captain Baskelett had done, and, as far as she could recollect
      subsequently, there was a packet of letters, or a pocket-book containing
      letters of Nevil&rsquo;s which he had lost, and which had been forwarded to Mr.
      Romfrey; for the pocket-book was originally his, and his address was
      printed inside. But among these letters was one from Dr. Shrapnel to
      Nevil: a letter so horrible that Rosamund frowned at the reminiscence of
      it, holding it to be too horrible for the quotation of a sentence. She
      owned she had forgotten any three consecutive words. Her known dislike of
      Captain Baskelett, however, was insufficient to make her see that it was
      unjustifiable in him to run about London reading it, with comments of the
      cruellest. Rosamund&rsquo;s greater detestation of Dr. Shrapnel blinded her to
      the offence committed by the man she would otherwise have been very ready
      to scorn. So small did the circumstance appear to Cecilia, notwithstanding
      her gentle opposition at the time she listened to it, that she never
      thought of mentioning it to her father, and only remembered it when
      Captain Baskelett, with Lord Palmet in his company, presented himself at
      Mount Laurels, and proposed to the colonel to read to him &lsquo;a letter from
      that scoundrelly old Shrapnel to Nevil Beauchamp, upon women, wives,
      thrones, republics, British loyalty, et caetera,&rsquo;&mdash;an et caetera that
      rolled a series of tremendous reverberations down the list of all things
      held precious by freeborn Englishmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have prevented the reading. But the colonel would have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Read on,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Mr. Romfrey saw no harm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Baskelett held up Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s letter to Commander Beauchamp, at
      about half a yard&rsquo;s distance on the level of his chin, as a big-chested
      singer in a concert-room holds his music-scroll.

      CHAPTER XXIX. THE EPISTLE OF DR. SHRAPNEL TO COMMANDER BEAUCHAMP
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before we give ear to the recital of Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s letter to his pupil in
      politics by the mouth of Captain Baskelett, it is necessary to defend this
      gentleman, as he would handsomely have defended himself, from the charge
      that he entertained ultimate designs in regard to the really abominable
      scrawl, which was like a child&rsquo;s drawing of ocean with here and there a
      sail capsized, and excited his disgust almost as much as did the contents
      his great indignation. He was prepared to read it, and stood blown out for
      the task, but it was temporarily too much for him. &lsquo;My dear Colonel, look
      at it, I entreat you,&rsquo; he said, handing the letter for exhibition, after
      fixing his eye-glass, and dropping it in repulsion. The common sentiment
      of mankind is offended by heterodoxy in mean attire; for there we see the
      self-convicted villain&mdash;the criminal caught in the act; we try it and
      convict it by instinct without the ceremony of a jury; and so thoroughly
      aware of our promptitude in this respect has our arch-enemy become since
      his mediaeval disgraces that his particular advice to his followers is now
      to scrupulously copy the world in externals; never to appear poorly
      clothed, nor to impart deceptive communications in bad handwriting. We can
      tell black from white, and our sagacity has taught him a lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett glanced at the detestable penmanship. Lord Palmet did the
      same, and cried, &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s worse than mine!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia had protested against the reading of the letter, and she declined
      to look at the writing. She was entreated, adjured to look, in Captain
      Baskelett&rsquo;s peculiarly pursuing fashion; a &lsquo;nay, but you shall,&rsquo; that she
      had been subjected to previously, and would have consented to run like a
      schoolgirl to escape from.
    </p>
    <p>
      To resume the defence of him: he was a man incapable of forming plots,
      because his head would not hold them. He was an impulsive man, who could
      impale a character of either sex by narrating fables touching persons of
      whom he thought lightly, and that being done he was devoid of malice,
      unless by chance his feelings or his interests were so aggrieved that his
      original haphazard impulse was bent to embrace new circumstances and be
      the parent of a line of successive impulses, in the main resembling an
      extremely far-sighted plot, whereat he gazed back with fondness, all the
      while protesting sincerely his perfect innocence of anything of the kind.
      Circumstances will often interwind with the moods of simply irritated men.
      In the present instance he could just perceive what might immediately come
      of his reading out of this atrocious epistle wherein Nevil Beauchamp was
      displayed the dangling puppet of a mountebank wire-pulley, infidel,
      agitator, leveller, and scoundrel. Cognizant of Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s overtures to
      Colonel Halkett, he traced them to that scheming woman in the house at
      Steynham, and he was of opinion that it was a friendly and good thing to
      do to let the old colonel and Cissy Halkett know Mr. Nevil through a bit
      of his correspondence. This, then, was a matter of business and duty that
      furnished an excuse for his going out of his, way to call at Mount Laurels
      on the old familiar footing, so as not to alarm the heiress.
    </p>
    <p>
      A warrior accustomed to wear the burnished breastplates between London and
      Windsor has, we know, more need to withstand than to discharge the shafts
      of amorous passion; he is indeed, as an object of beauty, notoriously
      compelled to be of the fair sex in his tactics, and must practise the arts
      and whims of nymphs to preserve himself: and no doubt it was the case with
      the famous Captain Baskelett, in whose mind sweet ladies held the place
      that the pensive politician gives to the masses, dreadful in their hatred,
      almost as dreadful in their affection. But an heiress is a distinct
      species among women; he hungered for the heiress; his elevation to
      Parliament made him regard her as both the ornament and the prop of his
      position; and it should be added that his pride, all the habits of thought
      of a conqueror of women, had been shocked by that stupefying rejection of
      him, which Cecilia had intimated to her father with the mere lowering of
      her eyelids. Conceive the highest bidder at an auction hearing the article
      announce that it will not have him! Captain Baskelett talked of it
      everywhere for a month or so:&mdash;the girl could not know her own mind,
      for she suited him exactly! and he requested the world to partake of his
      astonishment. Chronicles of the season in London informed him that he was
      not the only fellow to whom the gates were shut. She could hardly be
      thinking of Nevil? However, let the epistle be read. &lsquo;Now for the Shrapnel
      shot,&rsquo; he nodded finally to Colonel Halkett, expanded his bosom, or
      natural cuirass, as before-mentioned, and was vocable above the common
      pitch:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;&ldquo;MY BRAVE BEAUCHAMP,&mdash;On with your mission, and never a summing of
   results in hand, nor thirst for prospects, nor counting upon
   harvests; for seed sown in faith day by day is the nightly harvest
   of the soul, and with the soul we work. With the soul we see.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Captain Baskelett intervened: &lsquo;Ahem! I beg to observe that this delectable
      rubbish is underlined by old Nevil&rsquo;s pencil.&rsquo; He promised to do a little
      roaring whenever it occurred, and continued with ghastly false
      accentuation, an intermittent sprightliness and depression of tone in the
      wrong places.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;The soul,&rdquo; et caetera. Here we are!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Desires to realize our gains are akin to the passion of usury;
   these are tricks of the usurer to grasp his gold in act and
   imagination. Have none of them. Work at the people!&rdquo;
 &mdash;At them, remark&mdash;!

   &ldquo;Moveless do they seem to you? Why, so is the earth to the sowing
   husbandman, and though we cannot forecast a reaping season, we have
   in history durable testification that our seasons come in the souls
   of men, yea, as a planet that we have set in motion, and faster and
   faster are we spinning it, and firmer and firmer shall we set it to
   regularity of revolution. That means life!&rdquo;
 &mdash;Shrapnel roars: you will have Nevil in a minute.

   &ldquo;Recognize that now we have bare life; at best for the bulk of men
   the Saurian lizard&rsquo;s broad back soaking and roasting in primeval
   slime; or say, in the so-called teachers of men, as much of life as
   pricks the frog in March to stir and yawn, and up on a flaccid leap
   that rolls him over some three inches nearer to the ditchwater
   besought by his instinct.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ask you, did you ever hear? The flaccid frog! But on we go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;&ldquo;Professors, prophets, masters, each hitherto has had his creed and
   system to offer, good mayhap for the term; and each has put it forth
   for the truth everlasting, to drive the dagger to the heart of time,
   and put the axe to human growth!&mdash;that one circle of wisdom issuing
   of the experience and needs of their day, should act the despot over
   all other circles for ever!&mdash;so where at first light shone to light
   the yawning frog to his wet ditch, there, with the necessitated
   revolution of men&rsquo;s minds in the course of ages, darkness radiates.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s old Nevil. Upon my honour, I haven&rsquo;t a notion of what it all
      means, and I don&rsquo;t believe the old rascal Shrapnel has himself. And pray
      be patient, my dear colonel. You will find him practical presently. I&rsquo;ll
      skip, if you tell me to. Darkness radiates, does it!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;&ldquo;The creed that rose in heaven sets below; and where we had an
   angel we have claw-feet and fangs. Ask how that is! The creed is
   much what it was when the followers diverged it from the Founder.
   But humanity is not where it was when that creed was food and
   guidance. Creeds will not die not fighting. We cannot root them up
   out of us without blood.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He threatens blood!&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;&ldquo;Ours, my Beauchamp, is the belief that humanity advances beyond
   the limits of creeds, is to be tied to none. We reverence the
   Master in his teachings; we behold the limits of him in his creed&mdash;
   and that is not his work. We truly are his disciples, who see how
   far it was in him to do service; not they that made of his creed a
   strait-jacket for humanity. So, in our prayers we dedicate the
   world to God, not calling him great for a title, no&mdash;showing him we
   know him great in a limitless world, lord of a truth we tend to,
   have not grasped. I say Prayer is good. I counsel it to you again
   and again: in joy, in sickness of heart. The infidel will not pray;
   the creed-slave prays to the image in his box.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough!&rsquo; Colonel Halkett ejaculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;We,&rdquo;&rsquo; Captain Baskelett put out his hand for silence with an ineffable
      look of entreaty, for here was Shrapnel&rsquo;s hypocrisy in full bloom:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;&ldquo;We make prayer a part of us, praying for no gifts, no
   interventions; through the faith in prayer opening the soul to the
   undiscerned. And take this, my Beauchamp, for the good in prayer,
   that it makes us repose on the unknown with confidence, makes us
   flexible to change, makes us ready for revolution&mdash;for life, then!
   He who has the fountain of prayer in him will not complain of
   hazards. Prayer is the recognition of laws; the soul&rsquo;s exercise and
   source of strength; its thread of conjunction with them. Prayer for
   an object is the cajolery of an idol; the resource of superstition.
   There you misread it, Beauchamp. We that fight the living world
   must have the universal for succour of the truth in it. Cast forth
   the soul in prayer, you meet the effluence of the outer truth, you
   join with the creative elements giving breath to you; and that crust
   of habit which is the soul&rsquo;s tomb; and custom, the soul&rsquo;s tyrant;
   and pride, our volcano-peak that sinks us in a crater; and fear,
   which plucks the feathers from the wings of the soul and sits it
   naked and shivering in a vault, where the passing of a common
   hodman&rsquo;s foot above sounds like the king of terrors coming,&mdash;you are
   free of them, you live in the day and for the future, by this
   exercise and discipline of the soul&rsquo;s faith. Me it keeps young
   everlastingly, like the fountain of...&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say I cannot sit and hear any more of it!&rsquo; exclaimed the colonel,
      chafing out of patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Palmet said to Miss Halkett: &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it like what we used to remember
      of a sermon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia waited for her father to break away, but Captain Baskelett had
      undertaken to skip, and was murmuring in sing-song some of the phrases
      that warned him off:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;History&mdash;Bible of Humanity;... Permanency&mdash;enthusiast&rsquo;s dream&mdash;despot&rsquo;s
      aim&mdash;clutch of dead men&rsquo;s fingers in live flesh... Man animal; man
      angel; man rooted; man winged&rdquo;:... Really, all this is too bad. Ah! here
      we are: &ldquo;At them with outspeaking, Beauchamp!&rdquo; Here we are, colonel, and
      you will tell me whether you think it treasonable or not. &ldquo;At them,&rdquo; et
      caetera: &ldquo;We have signed no convention to respect their&rdquo;&mdash;he speaks
      of Englishmen, Colonel Halkett&mdash;&ldquo;their passive idolatries; a people
      with whom a mute conformity is as good as worship, but a word of dissent
      holds you up to execration; and only for the freedom won in foregone days
      their hate would be active. As we have them in their present stage,&rdquo;&mdash;old
      Nevil&rsquo;s mark&mdash;&ldquo;We are not parties to the tacit agreement to fill our
      mouths and shut our eyes. We speak because it is better they be roused to
      lapidate us than soused in their sty, with none to let them hear they live
      like swine, craving only not to be disturbed at the trough. The religion
      of this vast English middle-class ruling the land is Comfort. It is their
      central thought; their idea of necessity; their sole aim. Whatsoever
      ministers to Comfort, seems to belong to it, pretends to support it, they
      yield their passive worship to. Whatsoever alarms it they join to crush.
      There you get at their point of unity. They will pay for the security of
      Comfort, calling it national worship, or national defence, if too much
      money is not subtracted from the means of individual comfort: if too much
      foresight is not demanded for the comfort of their brains. Have at them
      there. Speak. Moveless as you find them, they are not yet all gross clay,
      and I say again, the true word spoken has its chance of somewhere
      alighting and striking root. Look not to that. Seeds perish in nature;
      good men fail. Look to the truth in you, and deliver it, with no
      afterthought of hope, for hope is dogged by dread; we give our courage as
      hostage for the fulfilment of what we hope. Meditate on that transaction.
      Hope is for boys and girls, to whom nature is kind. For men to hope is to
      tremble. Let prayer&mdash;the soul&rsquo;s overflow, the heart&rsquo;s resignation&mdash;supplant
      it...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon, colonel; I forgot to roar, but old Nevil marks all down that page
      for encomium,&rsquo; said Captain Baskelett. &lsquo;Oh! here we are. English loyalty
      is the subject. Now, pray attend to this, colonel. Shrapnel communicates
      to Beauchamp that if ten Beauchamps were spouting over the country without
      intermission he might condescend to hope. So on&mdash;to British loyalty.
      We are, so long as our sovereigns are well-conducted persons, and we
      cannot unseat them&mdash;observe; he is eminently explicit, the old
      traitor!&mdash;we are to submit to the outward forms of respect, but we
      are frankly to say we are Republicans; he has the impudence to swear that
      England is a Republican country, and calls our thoroughgoing loyalty&mdash;yours
      and mine, colonel&mdash;disloyalty. Hark: &ldquo;Where kings lead, it is to be
      supposed they are wanted. Service is the noble office on earth, and where
      kings do service let them take the first honours of the State: but&rdquo;&mdash;hark
      at this&mdash;&ldquo;the English middle-class, which has absorbed the upper, and
      despises, when it is not quaking before it, the lower, will have nothing
      above it but a ricketty ornament like that you see on a confectioner&rsquo;s
      twelfth-cake.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The man deserves hanging!&rsquo; said Colonel Halkett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Further, my dear colonel, and Nevil marks it pretty much throughout:
      &ldquo;This loyalty smacks of a terrible perfidy. Pass the lords and squires;
      they are old trees, old foundations, or joined to them, whether old or
      new; they naturally apprehend dislocation when a wind blows, a river
      rises, or a man speaks;&mdash;that comes of age or aping age: their hearts
      are in their holdings! For the loyalty of the rest of the land, it is the
      shopkeeper&rsquo;s loyalty, which is to be computed by the exact annual sum of
      his net profits. It is now at high tide. It will last with the prosperity
      of our commerce.&rdquo;&mdash;The insolent old vagabond!&mdash;&ldquo;Let commercial
      disasters come on us, and what of the loyalty now paying its hundreds of
      thousands, and howling down questioners! In a day of bankruptcies, how
      much would you bid for the loyalty of a class shivering under deprivation
      of luxuries, with its God Comfort beggared? Ay, my Beauchamp,&rdquo;&mdash;the
      most offensive thing to me is that &ldquo;my Beauchamp,&rdquo; but old Nevil has
      evidently given himself up hand and foot to this ruffian&mdash;&ldquo;ay, when
      you reflect that fear of the so-called rabble, i.e. the people, the
      unmoneyed class, which knows not Comfort, tastes not of luxuries, is the
      main component of their noisy frigid loyalty, and that the people are not
      with them but against, and yet that the people might be won by visible
      forthright kingly service to a loyalty outdoing theirs as the sun the
      moon; ay, that the people verily thirst to love and reverence; and that
      their love is the only love worth having, because it is disinterested
      love, and endures, and takes heat in adversity,&mdash;reflect on it and
      wonder at the inversion of things! So with a Church. It lives if it is at
      home with the poor. In the arms of enriched shopkeepers it rots, goes to
      decay in vestments&mdash;vestments! flakes of mummy-wraps for it! or else
      they use it for one of their political truncheons&mdash;to awe the
      ignorant masses: I quote them. So. Not much ahead of ancient Egyptians in
      spirituality or in priestcraft! They call it statesmanship. O for a word
      for it! Let Palsy and Cunning go to form a word. Deadmanship, I call it.&rdquo;&mdash;To
      quote my uncle the baron, this is lunatic dribble!&mdash;&ldquo;Parsons and
      princes are happy with the homage of this huge passive fleshpot class. It
      is enough for them. Why not? The taxes are paid and the tithes. Whilst
      commercial prosperity lasts!&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett threw his arms aloft.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;&ldquo;Meanwhile, note this: the people are the Power to come.
   Oppressed, unprotected, abandoned; left to the ebb and flow of the
   tides of the market, now taken on to work, now cast off to starve,
   committed to the shifting laws of demand and supply, slaves of
   Capital-the whited name for old accursed. Mammon: and of all the
   ranked and black-uniformed host no pastor to come out of the
   association of shepherds, and proclaim before heaven and man the
   primary claim of their cause; they are, I say, the power, worth the
   seduction of by another Power not mighty in England now: and likely
   in time to set up yet another Power not existing in England now.
   What if a passive comfortable clergy hand them over to men on the
   models of Irish pastors, who will succour, console, enfold, champion
   them? what if, when they have learnt to use their majority, sick of
   deceptions and the endless pulling of interests, they raise ONE
   representative to force the current of action with an authority as
   little fictitious as their preponderance of numbers? The despot and
   the priest! There I see our danger, Beauchamp. You and I and some
   dozen labour to tie and knot them to manliness. We are few; they
   are many and weak. Rome offers them real comfort in return for
   their mites in coin, and&mdash;poor souls! mites in conscience, many of
   them. A Tyrant offers them to be directly their friend. Ask,
   Beauchamp, why they should not have comfort for pay as well as the
   big round&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Captain Baskelett stopped and laid the letter out for Colonel Halkett to
      read an unmentionable word, shamelessly marked by Nevil&rsquo;s pencil:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;&mdash;belly-class!&rdquo; Ask, too, whether the comfort they wish for is not
   approaching divine compared with the stagnant fleshliness of that
   fat shopkeeper&rsquo;s Comfort.

   &lsquo;&ldquo;Warn the people of this. Ay, warn the clergy. It is not only the
   poor that are caught by ranters. Endeavour to make those
   accommodating shepherds understand that they stand a chance of
   losing rich as well as poor! It should awaken them. The helpless
   poor and the uneasy rich are alike open to the seductions of Romish
   priests and intoxicated ranters. I say so it will be if that band
   of forty thousand go on slumbering and nodding. They walk in a
   dream. The flesh is a dream. The soul only is life.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now for you, colonel.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;&ldquo;No extension of the army&mdash;no! A thousand times no. Let India go,
   then! Good for India that we hold India? Ay, good: but not at such
   a cost as an extra tax, or compulsory service of our working man.
   If India is to be held for the good of India, throw open India to
   the civilized nations, that they help us in a task that overstrains
   us. At present India means utter perversion of the policy of
   England. Adrift India! rather than England red-coated. We dissent,
   Beauchamp! For by-and-by.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is,&rsquo; Captain Baskelett explained, &lsquo;by-and-by Shrapnel will have old
      Nevil fast enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there more of it?&rsquo; said Colonel Halkett, flapping his forehead for
      coolness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The impudence of this dog in presuming to talk about India!&mdash;eh,
      colonel? Only a paragraph or two more: I skip a lot.... Ah! here we are.&rsquo; 
      Captain Baskelett read to himself and laughed in derision: &lsquo;He calls our
      Constitution a compact unsigned by the larger number involved in it.
      What&rsquo;s this? &ldquo;A band of dealers in fleshpottery.&rdquo; Do you detect a gleam of
      sense? He underscores it. Then he comes to this&rsquo;: Captain Baskelett
      requested Colonel Halkett to read for himself: &lsquo;The stench of the trail of
      Ego in our History.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel perused it with an unsavoury expression of his features, and
      jumped up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oddly, Mr. Romfrey thought this rather clever,&rsquo; said Captain Baskelett,
      and read rapidly:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;&ldquo;Trace the course of Ego for them: first the king who conquers and
   can govern. In his egoism he dubs him holy; his family is of a
   selected blood; he makes the crown hereditary&mdash;Ego. Son by son the
   shame of egoism increases; valour abates; hereditary Crown, no
   hereditary qualities. The Barons rise. They in turn hold sway, and
   for their order&mdash;Ego. The traders overturn them: each class rides
   the classes under it while it can. It is ego&mdash;ego, the fountain
   cry, origin, sole source of war! Then death to ego, I say! If
   those traders had ruled for other than ego, power might have rested
   with them on broad basis enough to carry us forward for centuries.
   The workmen have ever been too anxious to be ruled. Now comes on
   the workman&rsquo;s era. Numbers win in the end: proof of small wisdom in
   the world. Anyhow, with numbers there is rough nature&rsquo;s wisdom and
   justice. With numbers ego is inter-dependent and dispersed; it is
   universalized. Yet these may require correctives. If so, they will
   have it in a series of despots and revolutions that toss, mix, and
   bind the classes together: despots, revolutions; panting
   alternations of the quickened heart of humanity.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Marked by our friend Nevil in notes of admiration.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mad as the writer,&rsquo; groaned Colonel Halkett. &lsquo;Never in my life have I
      heard such stuff.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay, colonel; here&rsquo;s Shrapnel defending Morality and Society,&rsquo; said
      Captain Baskelett.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett vowed he was under no penal law to listen, and would not;
      but Captain Baskelett persuaded him: &lsquo;Yes, here it is: I give you my word.
      Apparently old Nevil has been standing up for every man&rsquo;s right to run
      away with... Yes, really! I give you my word; and here we have Shrapnel
      insisting on respect for the marriage laws. Do hear this; here it is in
      black and white:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Society is our one tangible gain, our one roofing and flooring in a
   world of most uncertain structures built on morasses. Toward the
   laws that support it men hopeful of progress give their adhesion.
   If it is martyrdom, what then? Let the martyrdom be. Contumacy is
   animalism. And attend to me,&rdquo; says Shrapnel, &ldquo;the truer the love
   the readier for sacrifice! A thousand times yes. Rebellion against
   Society, and advocacy of Humanity, run counter. Tell me Society is
   the whited sepulchre, that it is blotched, hideous, hollow: and I
   say, add not another disfigurement to it; add to the purification of
   it. And you, if you answer, what can only one? I say that is the
   animal&rsquo;s answer, and applies also to politics, where the question,
   what can one? put in the relapsing tone, shows the country decaying
   in the individual. Society is the protection of the weaker,
   therefore a shield of women, who are our temple of civilization, to
   be kept sacred; and he that loves a woman will assuredly esteem and
   pity her sex, and not drag her down for another example of their
   frailty. Fight this out within you&mdash;!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But you are right, colonel; we have had sufficient. I shall be getting a
      democratic orator&rsquo;s twang, or a crazy parson&rsquo;s, if I go on much further.
      He covers thirty-two pages of letter-paper. The conclusion is:&mdash;&ldquo;Jenny
      sends you her compliments, respects, and best wishes, and hopes she may
      see you before she goes to her friend Clara Sherwin and the General.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sherwin? Why, General Sherwin&rsquo;s a perfect gentleman,&rsquo; Colonel Halkett
      interjected; and Lord Palmet caught the other name: &lsquo;Jenny? That&rsquo;s Miss
      Denham, Jenny Denham; an amazingly pretty girl: beautiful thick brown
      hair, real hazel eyes, and walks like a yacht before the wind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps, colonel, Jenny accounts for the defence of society,&rsquo; said
      Captain Baskelett. &lsquo;I have no doubt Shrapnel has a scheme for Jenny. The
      old communist and socialist!&rsquo; He folded up the letter: &lsquo;A curious
      composition, is it not, Miss Halkett?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was thinking that he tempted her to be the apologist of even such
      a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One likes to know the worst, and what&rsquo;s possible,&rsquo; said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Captain Baskelett had gone, Colonel Halkett persisted in talking of
      the letter, and would have impressed on his daughter that the person to
      whom the letter was addressed must be partly responsible for the contents
      of it. Cecilia put on the argumentative air of a Court of Equity to
      discuss the point with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you defend that letter?&rsquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, no: she did not defend the letter; she thought it wicked and
      senseless. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;the superior strength of men to women seems
      to me to come from their examining all subjects, shrinking from none. At
      least, I should not condemn Nevil on account of his correspondence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall see,&rsquo; said her father, sighing rather heavily. &lsquo;I must have a
      talk with Mr. Romfrey about that letter.&rsquo;

      CHAPTER XXX. THE BAITING OF DR. SHRAPNEL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Captain Baskelett went down from Mount Laurels to Bevisham to arrange for
      the giving of a dinner to certain of his chief supporters in the borough,
      that they might know he was not obliged literally to sit in Parliament in
      order to pay a close attention to their affairs. He had not distinguished
      himself by a speech during the session, but he had stored a political
      precept or two in his memory, and, as he told Lord Palmet, he thought a
      dinner was due to his villains. &lsquo;The way to manage your Englishman,
      Palmet, is to dine him.&rsquo; As the dinner would decidedly be dull, he
      insisted on having Lord Palmet&rsquo;s company.
    </p>
    <p>
      They crossed over to the yachting island, where portions of the letter of
      Commander Beauchamp&rsquo;s correspondent were read at the Club, under the
      verandah, and the question put, whether a man who held those opinions had
      a right to wear his uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was transmitted to Steynham in time to be consigned to the
      pocket-book before Beauchamp arrived there on one of his rare visits. Mr.
      Romfrey handed him the pocketbook with the frank declaration that he had
      read Shrapnel&rsquo;s letter. &lsquo;All is fair in war, Sir!&rsquo; Beauchamp quoted him
      ambiguously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thieves had amused Mr. Romfrey by their scrupulous honesty in
      returning what was useless to them, while reserving the coat: but
      subsequently seeing the advertized reward, they had written to claim it;
      and, according to Rosamund Culling, he had been so tickled that he had
      deigned to reply to them, very briefly, but very comically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of the matter with her, Beauchamp said (so greatly was he
      infatuated with the dangerous man) that the reading of a letter of Dr.
      Shrapnel&rsquo;s could do nothing but good to any reflecting human creature: he
      admitted that as the lost pocket-book was addressed to Mr. Romfrey, it
      might have been by mistake that he had opened it, and read the topmost
      letter lying open. But he pressed Rosamund to say whether that one only
      had been read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s letter,&rsquo; Rosamund affirmed. &lsquo;The letter from Normandy
      was untouched by him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Untouched by anybody?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unopened, Nevil. You look incredulous.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not if I have your word, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced somewhat contemptuously at his uncle Everard&rsquo;s anachronistic
      notions of what was fair in war.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prove to him Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s affectionate interest in his fortunes,
      Rosamund mentioned the overtures which had been made to Colonel Halkett
      for a nuptial alliance between the two houses; and she said: &lsquo;Your uncle
      Everard was completely won by your manly way of taking his opposition to
      you in Bevisham. He pays for Captain Baskelett, but you and your fortunes
      are nearest his heart, Nevil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp hung silent. His first remark was, &lsquo;Yes, I want money. I must
      have money.&rsquo; By degrees he seemed to warm to some sense of gratitude. &lsquo;It
      was kind of the baron,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has a great affection for you, Nevil, though you know he spares no one
      who chooses to be antagonistic. All that is over. But do you not second
      him, Nevil? You admire her? You are not adverse?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp signified the horrid intermixture of yes and no, frowned in pain
      of mind, and Walked up and down. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no living woman I admire so
      much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has refused the highest matches.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hold her in every way incomparable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She tries to understand your political ideas, if she cannot quite
      sympathize with them, Nevil. And consider how hard it is for a young
      English lady, bred in refinement, to understand such things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; Beauchamp nodded; yes. Well, more &lsquo;s the pity for me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! Nevil, that fatal Renee!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ma&rsquo;am, I acquit you of any suspicion of your having read her letter in
      this pocket-book. She wishes me to marry. You would have seen it written
      here. She wishes it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fly, clipped wing!&rsquo; murmured Rosamund, and purposely sent a buzz into her
      ears to shut out his extravagant talk of Renee&rsquo;s friendly wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is it you women will not believe in the sincerity of a woman!&rsquo; he
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil, I am not alluding to the damage done to your election.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To my candidature, ma&rsquo;am. You mean those rumours, those lies of the
      enemy. Tell me how I could suppose you were alluding to them. You bring
      them forward now to justify your charge of &ldquo;fatal&rdquo; against her. She has
      one fault; she wants courage; she has none other, not one that is not
      excuseable. We won&rsquo;t speak of France. What did her father say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Colonel Halkett? I do not know. He and his daughter come here next week,
      and the colonel will expect to meet you here. That does not look like so
      positive an objection to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To me personally, no,&rsquo; said Beauchamp. &lsquo;But Mr. Romfrey has not told me
      that I am to meet them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps he has not thought it worth while. It is not his way. He has
      asked you to come. You and Miss Halkett will be left to yourselves. Her
      father assured Mr. Romfrey that he should not go beyond advising her. His
      advice might not be exactly favourable to you at present, but if you sued
      and she accepted&mdash;and she would, I am convinced she would; she was
      here with me, talking of you a whole afternoon, and I have eyes&mdash;then
      he would not oppose the match, and then I should see you settled, the
      husband of the handsomest wife and richest heiress in England.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A vision of Cecilia swam before him, gracious in stateliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two weeks back Renee&rsquo;s expression of a wish that he would marry had seemed
      to him an idle sentence in a letter breathing of her own intolerable
      situation. The marquis had been struck down by illness. What if she were
      to be soon suddenly free? But Renee could not be looking to freedom,
      otherwise she never would have written the wish for him to marry. She
      wrote perhaps hearing temptation whisper; perhaps wishing to save herself
      and him by the aid of a tie that would bring his honour into play and fix
      his loyalty. He remembered Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s written words: &lsquo;Rebellion
      against society and advocacy of humanity run counter.&rsquo; They had a stronger
      effect on him than when he was ignorant of his uncle Everard&rsquo;s plan to
      match him with Cecilia. He took refuge from them in the image of that
      beautiful desolate Renee, born to be beloved, now wasted, worse than
      trodden under foot&mdash;perverted; a life that looked to him for
      direction and resuscitation. She was as good as dead in her marriage. It
      was impossible for him ever to think of Renee without the surprising
      thrill of his enchantment with her, and tender pity that drew her closer
      to him by darkening her brightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still a man may love his wife. A wife like Cecilia was not to be imagined
      coldly. Let the knot once be tied, it would not be regretted, could not
      be; hers was a character, and hers a smile, firmly assuring him of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told Mr. Romfrey that he should be glad to meet Colonel Halkett and
      Cecilia. Business called him to Holdesbury. Thence he betook himself to
      Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s cottage to say farewell to Jenny Denham previous to her
      departure for Switzerland with her friend Clara Sherwin. She had never
      seen a snow-mountain, and it was pleasant to him to observe in her eyes,
      which he had known weighing and balancing intellectual questions more than
      he quite liked, a childlike effort to conjure in imagination the glories
      of the Alps. She appeared very happy, only a little anxious about leaving
      Dr. Shrapnel with no one to take care of him for a whole month. Beauchamp
      promised he would run over to him from Holdesbury, only an hour by rail,
      as often as he could. He envied her the sight of the Alps, he said, and
      tried to give her an idea of them, from which he broke off to boast of a
      famous little Jersey bull that he had won from a rival, an American,
      deeply in love with the bull; cutting him out by telegraph by just five
      minutes. The latter had examined the bull in the island and had passed on
      to Paris, not suspecting there would be haste to sell him. Beauchamp,
      seeing the bull advertized, took him on trust, galloped to the nearest
      telegraph station forthwith, and so obtained possession of him; and the
      bull was now shipped on the voyage. But for this precious bull, however,
      and other business, he would have been able to spend almost the entire
      month with Dr. Shrapnel, he said regretfully. Miss Denham on the contrary
      did not regret his active occupation. The story of his rush from the
      breakfast-table to the stables, and gallop away to the station, while the
      American Quaker gentleman soberly paced down a street in Paris on the same
      errand, in invisible rivalry, touched her risible fancy. She was
      especially pleased to think of him living in harmony with his uncle&mdash;that
      strange, lofty, powerful man, who by plot or by violence punished
      opposition to his will, but who must be kind at heart, as well as
      forethoughtful of his nephew&rsquo;s good; the assurance of it being, that when
      the conflict was at an end he had immediately installed him as manager of
      one of his estates, to give his energy play and make him practically
      useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day before she left home was passed by the three in botanizing, some
      miles distant from Bevisham, over sand country, marsh and meadow; Dr.
      Shrapnel, deep in the science, on one side of her, and Beauchamp,
      requiring instruction in the names and properties of every plant and
      simple, on the other. It was a day of summer sweetness, gentle laughter,
      conversation, and the happiest homeliness. The politicians uttered barely
      a syllable of politics. The dinner basket was emptied heartily to make way
      for herb and flower, and at night the expedition homeward was crowned with
      stars along a road refreshed by mid-day thunder-showers and smelling of
      the rain in the dust, past meadows keenly scenting, gardens giving out
      their innermost balm and odour. Late at night they drank tea in Jenny&rsquo;s
      own garden. They separated a little after two in the morning, when the
      faded Western light still lay warm on a bow of sky, and on the level of
      the East it quickened. Jenny felt sure she should long for that yesterday
      when she was among foreign scenes, even among high Alps-those mysterious
      eminences which seemed in her imagination to know of heaven and have the
      dawn of a new life for her beyond their peaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her last words when stepping into the railway carriage were to Beauchamp:
      &lsquo;Will you take care of him?&rsquo; She flung her arms round Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s neck,
      and gazed at him under troubled eyelids which seemed to be passing in
      review every vision of possible harm that might come to him during her
      absence; and so she continued gazing, and at no one but Dr. Shrapnel until
      the bend of the line cut him from her sight. Beauchamp was a very
      secondary person on that occasion, and he was unused to being so in the
      society of women&mdash;unused to find himself entirely eclipsed by their
      interest in another. He speculated on it, wondering at her concentrated
      fervency; for he had not supposed her to possess much warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      After she was fairly off on her journey, Dr. Shrapnel mentioned to
      Beauchamp a case of a Steynham poacher, whom he had thought it his duty to
      supply with means of defence. It was a common poaching case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp was not surprised that Mr. Romfrey and Dr. Shrapnel should come
      to a collision; the marvel was that it had never occurred before, and
      Beauchamp said at once: &lsquo;Oh, my uncle Mr. Romfrey would rather see them
      stand their ground than not.&rsquo; He was disposed to think well of his uncle.
      The Jersey bull called him away to Holdesbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Baskelett heard of this poaching case at Steynham, where he had to
      appear in person when he was in want of cheques, and the Bevisham dinner
      furnished an excuse for demanding one. He would have preferred a positive
      sum annually. Mr. Romfrey, however, though he wrote his cheques out like
      the lord he was by nature, exacted the request for them; a system that
      kept the gallant gentleman on his good behaviour, probably at a lower cost
      than the regular stipend. In handing the cheque to Cecil Baskelett, Mr.
      Romfrey spoke of a poacher, of an old poaching family called the Dicketts,
      who wanted punishment and was to have it, but Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s local lawyer
      had informed him that the man Shrapnel was, as usual, supplying the means
      of defence. For his own part, Mr. Romfrey said, he had no objection to one
      rascal&rsquo;s backing another, and Shrapnel might hit his hardest, only perhaps
      Nevil might somehow get mixed up in it, and Nevil was going on quietly now&mdash;he
      had in fact just done capitally in lassoing with a shot of the telegraph a
      splendid little Jersey bull that a Yankee was after: and on the whole it
      was best to try to keep him quiet, for he was mad about that man Shrapnel;
      Shrapnel was his joss: and if legal knocks came of this business Nevil
      might be thinking of interfering: &lsquo;Or he and I may be getting to exchange
      a lot of shindy letters,&rsquo; Mr. Romfrey said. &lsquo;Tell him I take Shrapnel just
      like any other man, and don&rsquo;t want to hear apologies, and I don&rsquo;t mix him
      up in it. Tell him if he likes to have an explanation from me, I&rsquo;ll give
      it him when he comes here. You can run over to Holdesbury the morning
      after your dinner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Baskelett said he would go. He was pleased with his cheque at the
      time, but hearing subsequently that Nevil was coming to Steynham to meet
      Colonel Halkett and his daughter, he became displeased, considering it a
      very silly commission. The more he thought of it the more ridiculous and
      unworthy it appeared. He asked himself and Lord Palmet also why he should
      have to go to Nevil at Holdesbury to tell him of circumstances that he
      would hear of two or three days later at Steynham. There was no sense in
      it. The only conclusion for him was that the scheming woman Culling had
      determined to bring down every man concerned in the Bevisham election, and
      particularly Mr. Romfrey, on his knees before Nevil. Holdesbury had been
      placed at his disposal, and the use of the house in London, which latter
      would have been extremely serviceable to Cecil as a place of dinners to
      the Parliament of Great Britain in lieu of the speech-making generally
      expected of Members, and not so effectively performed. One would think the
      baron had grown afraid of old Nevil! He had spoken as if he were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecil railed unreservedly to Lord Palmet against that woman &lsquo;Mistress
      Culling,&rsquo; as it pleased him to term her, and who could be offended by his
      calling her so? His fine wit revelled in bestowing titles that were at
      once batteries directed upon persons he hated, and entrenchments for
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four o&rsquo;clock on a sultry afternoon he sat at table with his Bevisham
      supporters, and pledged them correspondingly in English hotel champagne,
      sherry and claret. At seven he was rid of them, but parched and heated, as
      he deserved to be, he owned, for drinking the poison. It would be a good
      subject for Parliament if he could get it up, he reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now,&rsquo; said he to Palmet, &lsquo;we might be crossing over to the Club if I
      hadn&rsquo;t to go about that stupid business to Holdesbury to-morrow morning.
      We shall miss the race, or, at least, the start.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea struck him: &lsquo;Ten to one old Nevil &lsquo;s with Shrapnel,&rsquo; and no idea
      could be more natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We &lsquo;ll call on Shrapnel,&rsquo; said Palmet. &lsquo;We shall see Jenny Denham. He
      gives her out as his niece. Whatever she is she&rsquo;s a brimming little
      beauty. I assure you, Bask, you seldom see so pretty a girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Wine, which has directed men&rsquo;s footsteps upon more marvellous adventures,
      took them to a chemist&rsquo;s shop for a cooling effervescent draught, and
      thence through the town to the address, furnished to them by the chemist,
      of Dr. Shrapnel on the common.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bad wine, which is responsible for the fate of half the dismal bodies
      hanging from trees, weltering by rocks, grovelling and bleaching round the
      bedabbled mouth of the poet&rsquo;s Cave of Despair, had rendered Captain
      Baskelett&rsquo;s temper extremely irascible; so when he caught sight of Dr.
      Shrapnel walling in his garden, and perceived him of a giant&rsquo;s height, his
      eyes fastened on the writer of the abominable letter with an exultation
      peculiar to men having a devil inside them that kicks to be out. The sun
      was low, blazing among the thicker branches of the pollard forest trees,
      and through sprays of hawthorn. Dr. Shrapnel stopped, facing the visible
      master of men, at the end of his walk before he turned his back to
      continue the exercise and some discourse he was holding aloud either to
      the heavens or bands of invisible men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ahem, Dr. Shrapnel!&rsquo; He was accosted twice, the second time imperiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw two gentlemen outside the garden-hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I spoke, sir,&rsquo; said Captain Baskelett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hear you now, sir,&rsquo; said the doctor, walking in a parallel line with
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I desired to know, sir, if you are Dr. Shrapnel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived at the garden-gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have a charming garden, Dr. Shrapnel,&rsquo; said Lord Palmet, very affably
      and loudly, with a steady observation of the cottage windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Shrapnel flung the gate open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Palmet raised his hat and entered, crying loudly, &lsquo;A very charming
      garden, upon my word!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Baskelett followed him, bowing stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Captain Beauchamp&rsquo;s cousin. I am Captain Baskelett, one
      of the Members for the borough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor said, &lsquo;Ah.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish to see Captain Beauchamp, sir. He is absent?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall have him here shortly, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you will have him!&rsquo; Cecil paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Admirable roses!&rsquo; exclaimed Lord Palmet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have him, I think,&rsquo; said Cecil, &lsquo;if what we hear is correct. I wish
      to know, sir, whether the case you are conducting against his uncle is one
      you have communicated to Captain Beauchamp. I repeat, I am here to inquire
      if he is privy to it. You may hold family ties in contempt&mdash;Now, sir!
      I request you abstain from provocations with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Shrapnel had raised his head, with something of the rush of a rocket,
      from the stooping posture to listen, and his frown of non-intelligence
      might be interpreted as the coming on of the fury Radicals are prone to,
      by a gentleman who believed in their constant disposition to explode.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecil made play with a pacifying hand. &lsquo;We shall arrive at no
      understanding unless you are good enough to be perfectly calm. I repeat,
      my cousin Captain Beauchamp is more or less at variance with his family,
      owing to these doctrines of yours, and your extraordinary
      Michael-Scott-the-wizard kind of spell you seem to have cast upon his
      common sense as a man of the world. You have him, as you say. I do not
      dispute it. I have no, doubt you have him fast. But here is a case
      demanding a certain respect for decency. Pray, if I may ask you, be still,
      be quiet, and hear me out if you can. I am accustomed to explain myself to
      the comprehension of most men who are at large, and I tell you candidly I
      am not to be deceived or diverted from my path by a show of ignorance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is your immediate object, sir?&rsquo; said Dr. Shrapnel, chagrined by the
      mystification within him, and a fear that his patience was going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly,&rsquo; Cecil nodded. He was acute enough to see that he had
      established the happy commencement of fretfulness in the victim, which is
      equivalent to a hook well struck in the mouth of your fish, and with an
      angler&rsquo;s joy he prepared to play his man. &lsquo;Exactly. I have stated it. And
      you ask me. But I really must decline to run over the whole ground again
      for you. I am here to fulfil a duty to my family; a highly disagreeable
      one to me. I may fail, like the lady who came here previous to the
      Election, for the result of which I am assured I ought to thank your
      eminently disinterested services. I do. You recollect a lady calling on
      you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Shrapnel consulted his memory. &lsquo;I think I have a recollection of some
      lady calling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! you think you have a recollection of some lady calling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean a lady connected with Captain Beauchamp?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A lady connected with Captain Beauchamp. You are not aware of the
      situation of the lady?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I remember, she was a kind of confidential housekeeper, some one said,
      to Captain Beauchamp&rsquo;s uncle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A kind of confidential housekeeper! She is recognized in our family as a
      lady, sir. I can hardly expect better treatment at your hands than she met
      with, but I do positively request you to keep your temper whilst I am
      explaining my business to you. Now, sir! what now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A trifling breeze will set the tall tree bending, and Dr. Shrapnel did
      indeed appear to display the agitation of a full-driving storm when he was
      but harassed and vexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you mention your business concisely, if you Please?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Precisely; it is my endeavour. I supposed I had done so. To be frank, I
      would advise you to summon a member of your household, wife, daughter,
      housekeeper, any one you like, to whom you may appeal, and I too, whenever
      your recollections are at fault.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am competent,&rsquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But in justice to you,&rsquo; urged Cecil considerately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Shrapnel smoothed his chin hastily. &lsquo;Have you done?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Believe me, the instant I have an answer to my question, I have done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Name your question.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, sir. Now mark, I will be plain with you. There is no escape
      for you from this. You destroy my cousin&rsquo;s professional prospects&mdash;I
      request you to listen&mdash;you blast his career in the navy; it was
      considered promising. He was a gallant officer and a smart seaman. Very
      well. You set him up as a politician, to be knocked down, to a dead
      certainty. You set him against his class; you embroil him with his family
      ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On all those points,&rsquo; interposed Dr. Shrapnel, after dashing a hand to
      straighten his forelock; but Cecil vehemently entreated him to control his
      temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say you embroil him with his family, you cause him to be in everlasting
      altercation with his uncle Mr. Romfrey, materially to his personal
      detriment; and the question of his family is one that every man of sense
      would apprehend on the spot; for we, you should know, have, sir, an
      opinion of Captain Beauchamp&rsquo;s talents and abilities forbidding us to
      think he could possibly be the total simpleton you make him appear, unless
      to the seductions of your political instructions, other seductions were
      added.... You apprehend me, I am sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; cried the doctor, descending from his height and swinging about
      forlornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! yes, you do; you do indeed, you cannot avoid it; you quite apprehend
      me; it is admitted that you take my meaning: I insist on that. I have
      nothing to say but what is complimentary of the young lady, whoever she
      may turn out to be; bewitching, no doubt; and to speak frankly, Dr.
      Shrapnel, I, and I am pretty certain every honest man would think with me,
      I take it to be ten times more creditable to my cousin Captain Beauchamp
      that he should be under a lady&rsquo;s influence than under yours. Come, sir! I
      ask you. You must confess that a gallant officer and great admirer of the
      sex does not look such a donkey if he is led in silken strings by a
      beautiful creature. And mark&mdash;stop! mark this, Dr. Shrapnel: I say,
      to the lady we can all excuse a good deal, and at the same time you are to
      be congratulated on first-rate diplomacy in employing so charming an
      agent. I wish, I really wish you did it generally, I assure you: only,
      mark this&mdash;I do beg you to contain yourself for a minute, if possible&mdash;I
      say, my cousin Captain Beauchamp is fair game to hunt, and there is no law
      to prevent the chase, only you must not expect us to be quiet spectators
      of your sport; and we have, I say, undoubtedly a right to lay the case
      before the lady, and induce her to be a peace-agent in the family if we
      can. Very well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This garden is redolent of a lady&rsquo;s hand,&rsquo; sighed Palmet, poetical in his
      dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you taken too much wine, gentlemen?&rsquo; said Dr. Shrapnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecil put this impertinence aside with a graceful sweep of his fingers.
      &lsquo;You attempt to elude me, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not I! You mention some lady.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly. A young lady.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the name of the lady?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! You ask the name of the lady. And I too. What is it? I have heard two
      or three names.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you have heard villanies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Denham, Jenny Denham, Miss Jenny Denham,&rsquo; said Palmet, rejoiced at the
      opportunity of trumpeting her name so that she should not fail to hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I stake my reputation I have heard her called Shrapnel&mdash;Miss
      Shrapnel,&rsquo; said Cecil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor glanced hastily from one to the other of his visitors. &lsquo;The
      young lady is my ward; I am her guardian,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecil pursed his mouth. &lsquo;I have heard her called your niece.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Niece&mdash;ward; she is a lady by birth and education, in manners,
      accomplishments, and character; and she is under my protection,&rsquo; cried Dr.
      Shrapnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecil bowed. &lsquo;So you are for gentle birth? I forgot you are for morality
      too, and for praying; exactly; I recollect. But now let me tell you,
      entirely with the object of conciliation, my particular desire is to see
      the young lady, in your presence of course, and endeavour to persuade her,
      as I have very little doubt I shall do, assuming that you give me fair
      play, to exercise her influence, on this occasion contrary to yours, and
      save my cousin Captain Beauchamp from a fresh misunderstanding with his
      uncle Mr. Romfrey. Now, sir; now, there!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will not see Miss Denham with my sanction ever,&rsquo; said Dr. Shrapnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Then I perceive your policy. Mark, sir, my assumption was that the
      young lady would, on hearing my representations, exert herself to heal the
      breach between Captain Beauchamp and his family. You stand in the way. You
      treat me as you treated the lady who came here formerly to wrest your dupe
      from your clutches. If I mistake not, she saw the young lady you
      acknowledge to be your ward.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Shrapnel flashed back: &lsquo;I acknowledge? Mercy and justice! is there no
      peace with the man? You walk here to me, I can&rsquo;t yet guess why, from a
      town where I have enemies, and every scandal flies touching me and mine;
      and you&mdash;&rsquo; He stopped short to master his anger. He subdued it so far
      as to cloak it in an attempt to speak reasoningly, as angry men sometimes
      deceive themselves in doing, despite the good maxim for the wrathful&mdash;speak
      not at all. &lsquo;See,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I was never married. My dear friend dies, and
      leaves me his child to protect and rear; and though she bears her father&rsquo;s
      name, she is most wrongly and foully made to share the blows levelled at
      her guardian. Ay, have at me, all of you, as much as you will! Hold off
      from her. Were it true, the cowardice would be not a whit the smaller.
      Why, casting a stone like that, were it the size of a pebble and the
      weight of a glance, is to toss the whole cowardly world on an innocent
      young girl. And why suspect evil? You talk of that lady who paid me a
      visit here once, and whom I treated becomingly, I swear. I never do
      otherwise. She was a handsome woman; and what was she? The housekeeper of
      Captain Beauchamp&rsquo;s uncle. Hear me, if you please! To go with the world, I
      have as good a right to suppose the worst of an attractive lady in that
      situation as you regarding my ward: better warrant for scandalizing, I
      think; to go with the world. But now&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecil checked him, ejaculating, &lsquo;Thank you, Dr. Shrapnel; I thank you most
      cordially,&rsquo; with a shining smile. &lsquo;Stay, sir! no more. I take my leave of
      you. Not another word. No &ldquo;buts&rdquo;! I recognize that conciliation is out of
      the question: you are the natural protector of poachers, and you will not
      grant me an interview with the young lady you call your ward, that I may
      represent to her, as a person we presume to have a chance of moving you,
      how easily&mdash;I am determined you shall hear me, Dr. Shrapnel!&mdash;how
      easily the position of Captain Beauchamp may become precarious with his
      uncle Mr. Romfrey. And let me add&mdash;&ldquo;but&rdquo; and &ldquo;but&rdquo; me till Doomsday,
      sir!&mdash;if you were&mdash;I do hear you, sir, and you shall hear me&mdash;if
      you were a younger man, I say, I would hold you answerable to me for your
      scandalous and disgraceful insinuations.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Shrapnel was adroitly fenced and over-shouted. He shrugged, stuttered,
      swayed, wagged a bulrush-head, flapped his elbows, puffed like a swimmer
      in the breakers, tried many times to expostulate, and finding the effort
      useless, for his adversary was copious and commanding, relapsed, eyeing
      him as an object far removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecil rounded one of his perplexingly empty sentences and turned on his
      heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;War, then!&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you like,&rsquo; retorted the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Very good. Good evening.&rsquo; Cecil slightly lifted his hat, with the
      short projection of the head of the stately peacock in its walk, and
      passed out of the garden. Lord Palmet, deeply disappointed and mystified,
      went after him, leaving Dr. Shrapnel to shorten his garden walk with
      enormous long strides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you didn&rsquo;t manage the old boy,&rsquo; Palmet complained. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re
      people who have tea in their gardens; we might have sat down with them and
      talked, the best friends in the world, and come again to-morrow might have
      called her Jenny in a week. She didn&rsquo;t show her pretty nose at any of the
      windows.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion pooh-poohed and said: &lsquo;Foh! I&rsquo;m afraid I permitted myself to
      lose my self-command for a moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet sang out an amorous couplet to console himself. Captain Baskelett
      respected the poetic art for its magical power over woman&rsquo;s virtue, but he
      disliked hearing verses, and they were ill-suited to Palmet. He abused his
      friend roundly, telling him it was contemptible to be quoting verses. He
      was irritable still.
    </p>
    <p>
      He declared himself nevertheless much refreshed by his visit to Dr.
      Shrapnel. &lsquo;We shall have to sleep tonight in this unhallowed town, but I
      needn&rsquo;t be off to Holdesbury in the morning; I&rsquo;ve done my business. I
      shall write to the baron to-night, and we can cross the water to-morrow in
      time for operations.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter to Mr. Romfrey was composed before midnight. It was a long one,
      and when he had finished it, Cecil remembered that the act of composition
      had been assisted by a cigar in his mouth, and Mr. Romfrey detested the
      smell of tobacco. There was nothing to be done but to write the letter
      over again, somewhat more briefly: it ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thinking to kill two birds at a blow, I went yesterday with Palmet after
      the dinner at this place to Shrapnel&rsquo;s house, where, as I heard, I stood a
      chance of catching friend Nevil. The young person living under the man&rsquo;s
      protection was absent, and so was the &ldquo;poor dear commander,&rdquo; perhaps
      attending on his bull. Shrapnel said he was expecting him. I write to you
      to confess I thought myself a cleverer fellow than I am. I talked to
      Shrapnel and tried hard to reason with him. I hope I can keep my temper
      under ordinary circumstances. You will understand that it required
      remarkable restraint when I make you acquainted with the fact that a
      lady&rsquo;s name was introduced, which, as your representative in relation to
      her, I was bound to defend from a gratuitous and scoundrelly aspersion.
      Shrapnel&rsquo;s epistle to &ldquo;brave Beauchamp&rdquo; is Church hymnification in
      comparison with his conversation. He is indubitably one of the greatest
      ruffians of his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I took the step with the best of intentions, and all I can plead is that
      I am not a diplomatist of sixty. His last word was that he is for war with
      us. As far as we men are concerned it is of small importance. I should
      think that the sort of society he would scandalize a lady in is not much
      to be feared. I have given him his warning. He tops me by about a head,
      and loses his temper every two minutes. I could have drawn him out
      deliciously if he had not rather disturbed mine. By this time my
      equanimity is restored. The only thing I apprehend is your displeasure
      with me for having gone to the man. I have done no good, and it prevents
      me from running over to Holdesbury to see Nevil, for if &ldquo;shindy letters,&rdquo;
       as you call them, are bad, shindy meetings are worse. I should be telling
      him my opinion of Shrapnel, he would be firing out, I should retort, he
      would yell, I should snap my fingers, and he would go into convulsions. I
      am convinced that a cattle-breeder ought to keep himself particularly
      calm. So unless I have further orders from you I refrain from going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The dinner was enthusiastic. I sat three hours among my Commons, they on
      me for that length of time&mdash;fatiguing, but a duty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecil subscribed his name with the warmest affection toward his uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brevity of the second letter had not brought him nearer to the truth
      in rescinding the picturesque accessories of his altercation with Dr.
      Shrapnel, but it veraciously expressed the sentiments he felt, and that
      was the palpable truth for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He posted the letter next morning.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. SHOWING A CHIVALROUS GENTLEMAN SET IN MOTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      About noon the day following, on board the steam-yacht of the Countess of
      Menai, Cecil was very much astonished to see Mr. Romfrey descending into a
      boat hard by, from Grancey Lespel&rsquo;s hired cutter. Steam was up, and the
      countess was off for a cruise in the Channel, as it was not a race-day,
      but seeing Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s hand raised, she spoke to Cecil, and immediately
      gave orders to wait for the boat. This lady was a fervent admirer of the
      knightly gentleman, and had reason to like him, for he had once been her
      champion. Mr. Romfrey mounted the steps, received her greeting, and
      beckoned to Cecil. He carried a gold-headed horsewhip under his arm. Lady
      Menai would gladly have persuaded him to be one of her company for the
      day&rsquo;s voyage, but he said he had business in Bevisham, and moving aside
      with Cecil, put the question to him abruptly: &lsquo;What were the words used by
      Shrapnel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The identical words?&rsquo; Captain Baskelett asked. He could have tripped out
      the words with the fluency of ancient historians relating what great
      kings, ambassadors, or Generals may well have uttered on State occasions,
      but if you want the identical words, who is to remember them the day after
      they have been delivered? He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, as for the identical words, I really, and I was tolerably excited,
      sir, and upon my honour, the identical words are rather difficult to....&rsquo; 
      He glanced at the horsewhip, and pricked by the sight of it to proceed,
      thought it good to soften the matter if possible. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t quite
      recollect... I wrote off to you rather hastily. I think he said&mdash;but
      Palmet was there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shrapnel spoke the words before Lord Palmet?&rsquo; said Mr. Romfrey austerely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Baskelett summoned Palmet to come near, and inquired of him what
      he had heard Shrapnel say, suggesting: &lsquo;He spoke of a handsome woman for a
      housekeeper, and all the world knew her character?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Romfrey cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or knew she had no character,&rsquo; Cecil pursued in a fit of gratified
      spleen, in scorn of the woman. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you recollect his accent in
      pronouncing housekeeper?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The menacing thunder sounded from Mr. Romfrey. He was patient in
      appearance, and waited for Cecil&rsquo;s witness to corroborate the evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened (and here we are in one of the circles of small things
      producing great consequences, which have inspired diminutive philosophers
      with ironical visions of history and the littleness of man), it happened
      that Lord Palmet, the humanest of young aristocrats, well-disposed toward
      the entire world, especially to women, also to men in any way related to
      pretty women, had just lit a cigar, and it was a cigar that he had been
      recommended to try the flavour of; and though he, having his wits about
      him, was fully aware that shipboard is no good place for a trial of the
      delicacy of tobacco in the leaf, he had begun puffing and sniffing in a
      critical spirit, and scarcely knew for the moment what to decide as to
      this particular cigar. He remembered, however, Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s objection to
      tobacco. Imagining that he saw the expression of a profound distaste in
      that gentleman&rsquo;s more than usually serious face, he hesitated between
      casting the cigar into the water and retaining it. He decided upon the
      latter course, and held the cigar behind his back, bowing to Mr. Romfrey
      at about a couple of yards distance, and saying to Cecil, &lsquo;Housekeeper;
      yes, I remember hearing housekeeper. I think so. Housekeeper? yes, oh
      yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And handsome housekeepers were doubtful characters,&rsquo; Captain Baskelett
      prompted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Palmet laughed out a single &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; that seemed to excuse him for lounging
      away to the forepart of the vessel, where he tugged at his fine specimen
      of a cigar to rekindle it, and discharged it with a wry grimace, so
      delicate is the flavour of that weed, and so adversely ever is it affected
      by a breeze and a moist atmosphere. He could then return undivided in his
      mind to Mr. Romfrey and Cecil, but the subject was not resumed in his
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Countess of Menai steamed into Bevisham to land Mr. Romfrey there. &lsquo;I
      can be out in the Channel any day; it is not every day that I see you,&rsquo; 
      she said, in support of her proposal to take him over.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat together conversing, apart from the rest of the company, until
      they sighted Bevisham, when Mr. Romfrey stood up, and a little crowd of
      men came round him to enjoy his famous racy talk. Captain Baskelett
      offered to land with him. He declined companionship. Dropping her hand in
      his, the countess asked him what he had to do in that town, and he
      replied, &lsquo;I have to demand an apology.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Answering the direct look of his eyes, she said, &lsquo;Oh, I shall not speak of
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In his younger days, if the rumour was correct, he had done the same on
      her account.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped into the boat, and presently they saw him mount the pier-steps,
      with the riding-whip under his arm, his head more than commonly bent, a
      noticeable point in a man of his tall erect figure. The ladies and some of
      the gentlemen thought he was looking particularly grave, even sorrowful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Menai inquired of Captain Baskelett whether he knew the nature of his
      uncle&rsquo;s business in Bevisham, the town he despised.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could Cecil say but no? His uncle had not imparted it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was flattered in being the sole confidante, and said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sprightly ingenuity of Captain Baskelett&rsquo;s mind would have informed
      him of the nature of his uncle&rsquo;s expedition, we may be sure, had he put it
      to the trial; for Mr. Romfrey was as plain to read as a rudimentary sum in
      arithmetic, and like the tracings of a pedigree-map his preliminary steps
      to deeds were seen pointing on their issue in lines of straight descent.
      But Cecil could protest that he was not bound to know, and considering
      that he was neither bound to know nor to speculate, he determined to stand
      on his right. So effectually did he accomplish the task, that he was
      frequently surprised during the evening and the night by the effervescence
      of a secret exultation rising imp-like within him, that was, he assured
      himself, perfectly unaccountable.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. AN EFFORT TO CONQUER CECILIA IN BEAUCHAMP&rsquo;S FASHION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day after Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s landing in Bevisham a full South-wester
      stretched the canvas of yachts of all classes, schooner, cutter and yawl,
      on the lively green water between the island and the forest shore.
      Cecilia&rsquo;s noble schooner was sure to be out in such a ringing breeze, for
      the pride of it as well as the pleasure. She landed her father at the Club
      steps, and then bore away Eastward to sight a cutter race, the breeze
      beginning to stiffen. Looking back against sun and wind, she saw herself
      pursued by a saucy little 15-ton craft that had been in her track since
      she left the Otley river before noon, dipping and straining, with every
      inch of sail set; as mad a stern chase as ever was witnessed: and who
      could the man at the tiller, clad cap-A-pie in tarpaulin, be? She led him
      dancing away, to prove his resoluteness and laugh at him. She had the
      powerful wings, and a glory in them coming of this pursuit: her triumph
      was delicious, until the occasional sparkle of the tarpaulin was lost, the
      small boat appeared a motionless object far behind, and all ahead of her
      exceedingly dull, though the race hung there and the crowd of sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia&rsquo;s transient flutter of coquettry created by the animating air and
      her queenly flight was over. She fled splendidly and she came back
      graciously. But he refused her open hand, as it were. He made as if to
      stand across her tack, and, reconsidering it, evidently scorned his
      advantage and challenged the stately vessel for a beat up against the
      wind. It was as pretty as a Court minuet. But presently Cecilia stood too
      far on one tack, and returning to the centre of the channel, found herself
      headed by seamanship. He waved an ironical salute with his sou&rsquo;wester. Her
      retort consisted in bringing her vessel to the wind, and sending a boat
      for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did it on the impulse; had she consulted her wishes she would rather
      have seen him at his post, where he seemed in his element, facing the
      spray and cunningly calculating to get wind and tide in his favour. Partly
      with regret she saw him, stripped of his tarpaulin, jump into her boat, as
      though she had once more to say farewell to sailor Nevil Beauchamp;
      farewell the bright youth, the hero, the true servant of his country!
    </p>
    <p>
      That feeling of hers changed when he was on board. The stirring cordial
      day had put new breath in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Should not the flag be dipped?&rsquo; he said, looking up at the peak, where
      the white flag streamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you really mistake compassion for defeat?&rsquo; said she, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! before the wind of course I hadn&rsquo;t a chance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How could you be so presumptuous as to give chase? And who has lent you
      that little cutter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp had hired her for a month, and he praised her sailing, and
      pretended to say that the race was not always to the strong in a stiff
      breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But in point&rsquo; of fact I was bent on trying how my boat swims, and had no
      idea of overhauling you. To-day our salt-water lake is as fine as the
      Mediterranean.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Omitting the islands and the Mediterranean colour, it is. I have often
      told you how I love it. I have landed papa at the Club. Are you aware that
      we meet you at Steynham the day after to-morrow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, we can ride on the downs. The downs between three and four of a
      summer&rsquo;s morning are as lovely as anything in the world. They have the
      softest outlines imaginable... and remind me of a friend&rsquo;s upper lip when
      she deigns to smile.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is one to rise at that hour to behold the effect? And let me remind you
      further, Nevil, that the comparison of nature&rsquo;s minor work beside her
      mighty is an error, if you will be poetical.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She cited a well-known instance of degradation in verse.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a young man who happens to be intimately acquainted with a certain
      &lsquo;dark eye in woman&rsquo; will not so lightly be brought to consider that the
      comparison of tempestuous night to the flashing of those eyes of hers
      topples the scene headlong from grandeur. And if Beauchamp remembered
      rightly, the scene was the Alps at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was prepared to contest Cecilia&rsquo;s judgement. At that moment the breeze
      freshened and the canvas lifted from due South the yacht swung her sails
      to drive toward the West, and Cecilia&rsquo;s face and hair came out golden in
      the sunlight. Speech was difficult, admiration natural, so he sat beside
      her, admiring in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said a good word for the smartness of his little yacht.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is my first trial of her,&rsquo; said Beauchamp. &lsquo;I hired her chiefly to
      give Dr. Shrapnel a taste of salt air. I &lsquo;ve no real right to be idling
      about. His ward Miss Denham is travelling in Switzerland; the dear old man
      is alone, and not quite so well as I should wish. Change of scene will do
      him good. I shall land him on the French coast for a couple of days, or
      take him down Channel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia gazed abstractedly at a passing schooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He works too hard,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who does?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dr. Shrapnel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one else whom we have heard of works too hard, and it would be happy
      for mankind if he did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia named the schooner; an American that had beaten our crack yachts.
      Beauchamp sprang up to spy at the American.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the Corinne, is she!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Yankee craftiness on salt water always excited his respectful attention as
      a spectator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what is the name of your boat, Nevil?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fool of an owner calls her the Petrel. It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m
      superstitious, but to give a boat a name of bad augury to sailors appears
      to me... however, I &lsquo;ve argued it with him and I will have her called the
      Curlew. Carrying Dr. Shrapnel and me, Petrel would be thought the proper
      title for her isn&rsquo;t that your idea?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed and she smiled, and then he became overcast with his political
      face, and said, &lsquo;I hope&mdash;I believe&mdash;you will alter your opinion
      of him. Can it be an opinion when it&rsquo;s founded on nothing? You know really
      nothing of him. I have in my pocket what I believe would alter your mind
      about him entirely. I do think so; and I think so because I feel you would
      appreciate his deep sincerity and real nobleness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it a talisman that you have, Nevil?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it&rsquo;s a letter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia&rsquo;s cheeks took fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should so much like to read it to you,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not, please,&rsquo; she replied with a dash of supplication in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not the whole of it&mdash;an extract here and there? I want you so much
      to understand him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure I should not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me try you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray do not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Merely to show you...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Nevil, I do not wish to understand him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you have only to listen for a few minutes, and I want you to know
      what good reason I have to reverence him as a teacher and a friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia looked at Beauchamp with wonder. A confused recollection of the
      contents of the letter declaimed at Mount Laurels in Captain Baskelett&rsquo;s
      absurd sing-song, surged up in her mind revoltingly. She signified a
      decided negative. Something of a shudder accompanied the expression of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he as little as any member of the Romfrey blood was framed to let the
      word no stand quietly opposed to him. And the no that a woman utters! It
      calls for wholesome tyranny. Those old, those hoar-old duellists, Yes and
      No, have rarely been better matched than in Beauchamp and Cecilia. For if
      he was obstinate in attack she had great resisting power. Twice to listen
      to that letter was beyond her endurance. Indeed it cast a shadow on him
      and disfigured him; and when, affecting to plead, he said: &lsquo;You must
      listen to it to please me, for my sake, Cecilia,&rsquo; she answered: &lsquo;It is for
      your sake, Nevil, I decline to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what do you know of it?&rsquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know the kind of writing it would be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you know it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have heard of some of Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s opinions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You imagine him to be subversive, intolerant, immoral, and the rest! all
      that comes under your word revolutionary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Possibly; but I must defend myself from hearing what I know will be
      certain to annoy me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But he is the reverse of immoral: and I intend to read you parts of the
      letter to prove to you that he is not the man you would blame, but I, and
      that if ever I am worthier... worthier of you, as I hope to become, it
      will be owing to this admirable and good old man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia trembled: she was touched to the quick. Yet it was not pleasant to
      her to be wooed obliquely, through Dr. Shrapnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recognized the very letter, crowned with many stamps, thick with many
      pages, in Beauchamp&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When you are at Steynham you will probably hear my uncle Everard&rsquo;s
      version of this letter,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;The baron chooses to think everything
      fair in war, and the letter came accidentally into his hands with the seal
      broken; well, he read it. And, Cecilia, you can fancy the sort of stuff he
      would make of it. Apart from that, I want you particularly to know how
      much I am indebted to Dr. Shrapnel. Won&rsquo;t you learn to like him a little?
      Won&rsquo;t you tolerate him?&mdash;I could almost say, for my sake! He and I
      are at variance on certain points, but taking him altogether, I am under
      deeper obligations to him than to any man on earth. He has found where I
      bend and waver.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I recognize your chivalry, Nevil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has done his best to train me to be of some service. Where&rsquo;s the
      chivalry in owning a debt? He is one of our true warriors; fearless and
      blameless. I have had my heroes before. You know how I loved Robert Hall:
      his death is a gap in my life. He is a light for fighting Englishmen&mdash;who
      fight with the sword. But the scale of the war, the cause, and the end in
      view, raise Dr. Shrapnel above the bravest I have ever had the luck to
      meet. Soldiers and sailors have their excitement to keep them up to the
      mark; praise and rewards. He is in his eight-and-sixtieth year, and he has
      never received anything but obloquy for his pains. Half of the small
      fortune he has goes in charities and subscriptions. Will that touch you?
      But I think little of that, and so does he. Charity is a common duty. The
      dedication of a man&rsquo;s life and whole mind to a cause, there&rsquo;s heroism. I
      wish I were eloquent; I wish I could move you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia turned her face to him. &lsquo;I listen to you with pleasure, Nevil; but
      please do not read the letter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; a paragraph or two I must read.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was promptly by her side. &lsquo;If I say I ask you for one sign that you
      care for me in some degree?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not for a moment ceased to be your friend, Nevil, since I was a
      child.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if you allow yourself to be so prejudiced against my best friend that
      you will not hear a word of his writing, are you friendly?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Feminine, and obstinate,&rsquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me your eyes an instant. I know you think me reckless and lawless:
      now is not that true? You doubt whether, if a lady gave me her hand I
      should hold to it in perfect faith. Or, perhaps not that: but you do
      suspect I should be capable of every sophism under the sun to persuade a
      woman to break her faith, if it suited me: supposing some passion to be at
      work. Men who are open to passion have to be taught reflection before they
      distinguish between the woman they should sue for love because she would
      be their best mate, and the woman who has thrown a spell on them. Now,
      what I beg you to let me read you in this letter is a truth nobly stated
      that has gone into my blood, and changed me. It cannot fail, too, in
      changeing your opinion of Dr. Shrapnel. It makes me wretched that you
      should be divided from me in your ideas of him. I, you see&mdash;and I
      confess I think it my chief title to honour&mdash;reverence him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I regret that I am unable to utter the words of Ruth,&rsquo; said Cecilia, in a
      low voice. She felt rather tremulously; opposed only to the letter and the
      writer of it, not at all to Beauchamp, except on account of his idolatry
      of the wicked revolutionist. Far from having a sense of opposition to
      Beauchamp; she pitied him for his infatuation, and in her lofty mental
      serenity she warmed to him for the seeming boyishness of his constant and
      extravagant worship of the man, though such an enthusiasm cast shadows on
      his intellect.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was reading a sentence of the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hear nothing but the breeze, Nevil,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breeze fluttered the letter-sheets: they threatened to fly. Cecilia
      stepped two paces away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hark; there is a military band playing on the pier,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;I am so
      fond of hearing music a little off shore.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp consigned the letter to his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not offended, Nevil?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me, no. You haven&rsquo;t a mind for tonics, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Healthy persons rarely have,&rsquo; she remarked, and asked him, smiling
      softly, whether he had a mind for music.
    </p>
    <p>
      His insensibility to music was curious, considering how impressionable he
      was to verse, and to songs of birds. He listened with an oppressed look,
      as to something the particular secret of which had to be reached by a
      determined effort of sympathy for those whom it affected. He liked it if
      she did, and said he liked it, reiterated that he liked it, clearly trying
      hard to comprehend it, as unmoved by the swell and sigh of the resonant
      brass as a man could be, while her romantic spirit thrilled to it, and was
      bountiful in glowing visions and in tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There hung her hand. She would not have refused to yield it. The hero of
      her childhood, the friend of her womanhood, and her hero still, might have
      taken her with half a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp was thinking: She can listen to that brass band, and she shuts
      her ears to this letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      The reading of it would have been a prelude to the opening of his heart to
      her, at the same time that it vindicated his dear and honoured master, as
      he called Dr. Shrapnel. To speak, without the explanation of his previous
      reticence which this letter would afford, seemed useless: even the desire
      to speak was absent, passion being absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see papa; he is getting into a boat with some one,&rsquo; said Cecilia, and
      gave orders for the yacht to stand in toward the Club steps. &lsquo;Do you know,
      Nevil, the Italian common people are not so subject to the charm of music
      as other races? They have more of the gift, and I think less of the
      feeling. You do not hear much music in Italy. I remember in the year of
      Revolution there was danger of a rising in some Austrian city, and a
      colonel of a regiment commanded his band to play. The mob was put in good
      humour immediately.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a soporific,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would not rather have had them rise to be slaughtered?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you have them waltzed into perpetual servility?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia hummed, and suggested: &lsquo;If one can have them happy in any way?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then the day of destruction may almost be dated.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil, your terrible view of life must be false.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I make it out worse to you than to any one else, because I want our minds
      to be united.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me a respite now and then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With all my heart. And forgive me for beating my drum. I see what others
      don&rsquo;t see, or else I feel it more; I don&rsquo;t know; but it appears to me our
      country needs rousing if it&rsquo;s to live. There &lsquo;s a division between poor
      and rich that you have no conception of, and it can&rsquo;t safely be left
      unnoticed. I&rsquo;ve done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her and saw tears on her under-lids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dearest Cecilia!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Music makes me childish,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father was approaching in the boat. Beside him sat the Earl of
      Lockrace, latterly classed among the suitors of the lady of Mount Laurels.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes remained to Beauchamp of his lost opportunity. Instead of
      seizing them with his usual promptitude, he let them slip, painfully
      mindful of his treatment of her last year after the drive into Bevisham,
      when she was England, and Renee holiday France.
    </p>
    <p>
      This feeling he fervently translated into the reflection that the bride
      who would bring him beauty and wealth, and her especial gift of tender
      womanliness, was not yet so thoroughly mastered as to grant her husband
      his just prevalence with her, or even indeed his complete independence of
      action, without which life itself was not desireable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett stared at Beauchamp as if he had risen from the deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you been in that town this morning?&rsquo; was one of his first questions
      to him when he stood on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I came through it,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, and pointed to his little cutter
      labouring in the distance. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s mine for a month; I came from Holdesbury
      to try her; and then he stated how he had danced attendance on the
      schooner for a couple of hours before any notice was taken of him, and
      Cecilia with her graceful humour held up his presumption to scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father was eyeing Beauchamp narrowly, and appeared troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you see Mr. Romfrey yesterday, or this morning?&rsquo; the colonel asked
      him, mentioning that Mr. Romfrey had been somewhere about the island
      yesterday, at which Beauchamp expressed astonishment, for his uncle
      Everard seldom visited a yachting station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett exchanged looks with Cecilia. Hers were inquiring, and he
      confirmed her side-glance at Beauchamp. She raised her brows; he nodded,
      to signify that there was gravity in the case. Here the signalling stopped
      short; she had to carry on a conversation with Lord Lockrace, one of those
      men who betray the latent despot in an exhibition of discontentment unless
      they have all a lady&rsquo;s hundred eyes attentive to their discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Beauchamp quitted the vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was out of hearing, Colonel Halkett said to Cecilia: &lsquo;Grancey
      Lespel tells me that Mr. Romfrey called on the man Shrapnel yesterday
      evening at six o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Papa?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now come and see the fittings below,&rsquo; the colonel addressed Lord
      Lockrace, and murmured to his daughter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And soundly horsewhipped him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia turned on the instant to gaze after Nevil Beauchamp. She could
      have wept for pity. Her father&rsquo;s emphasis on &lsquo;soundly&rsquo; declared an
      approval of the deed, and she was chilled by a sickening abhorrence and
      dread of the cruel brute in men, such as, awakened by she knew not what,
      had haunted her for a year of her girlhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he deserved it!&rsquo; the colonel pursued, on emerging from the cabin at
      Lord Lockrace&rsquo;s heels. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt he richly deserved it. The writer of
      that letter we heard Captain Baskelett read the other day deserves the
      very worst he gets.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Baskelett bored the Club the other night with a letter of a Radical
      fellow,&rsquo; said Lord Lockrace. &lsquo;Men who write that stuff should be strung up
      and whipped by the common hangman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was a private letter,&rsquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Public or private, Miss Halkett.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mind flew back to Seymour Austin for the sense of stedfastness when
      she heard such language as this, which, taken in conjunction with Dr.
      Shrapnel&rsquo;s, seemed to uncloak our Constitutional realm and show it boiling
      up with the frightful elements of primitive societies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose we are but half civilized,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If that,&rsquo; said the earl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett protested that he never could quite make out what Radicals
      were driving at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The rents,&rsquo; Lord Lockrace observed in the conclusive tone of brevity. He
      did not stay very long.
    </p>
    <p>
      The schooner was boarded subsequently by another nobleman, an Admiral of
      the Fleet and ex-minister of the Whig Government, Lord Croyston, who was a
      friend of Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s, and thought well of Nevil Beauchamp as a seaman
      and naval officer, but shook an old head over him as a politician. He came
      to beg a passage across the water to his marine Lodge, an accident having
      happened early in the morning to his yacht, the Lady Violet. He was able
      to communicate the latest version of the horsewhipping of Dr. Shrapnel,
      from which it appeared that after Mr. Romfrey had handsomely flogged the
      man he flung his card on the prostrate body, to let men know who was
      responsible for the act. He expected that Mr. Romfrey would be subjected
      to legal proceedings. &lsquo;But if there&rsquo;s a pleasure worth paying for it&rsquo;s the
      trouncing of a villain,&rsquo; said he; and he had been informed that Dr.
      Shrapnel was a big one. Lord Croyston&rsquo;s favourite country residence was in
      the neighbourhood of old Mrs. Beauchamp, on the Upper Thames. Speaking of
      Nevil Beauchamp a second time, he alluded to his relations with his
      great-aunt, said his prospects were bad, that she had interdicted her
      house to him, and was devoted to her other great-nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so she should be,&rsquo; said Colonel Halkett. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a young man who&rsquo;s an
      Englishman without French gunpowder notions in his head. He works for us
      down at the mine in Wales a good part of the year, and has tided us over a
      threatening strike there: gratuitously: I can&rsquo;t get him to accept
      anything. I can&rsquo;t think why he does it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll have plenty,&rsquo; said Lord Croyston, levelling his telescope to sight
      the racing cutters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia fancied she descried Nevil&rsquo;s Petrel, dubbed Curlew, to Eastward,
      and had a faint gladness in the thought that his knowledge of his uncle
      Everard&rsquo;s deed of violence would be deferred for another two or three
      hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to persuade her father to wait for Nevil, and invite him to dine
      at Mount Laurels, and break the news to him gently. Colonel Halkett argued
      that in speaking of the affair he should certainly not commiserate the man
      who had got his deserts, and saying this he burst into a petty fury
      against the epistle of Dr. Shrapnel, which appeared to be growing more
      monstrous in proportion to his forgetfulness of the details, as mountains
      gather vastness to the eye at a certain remove. Though he could not guess
      the reason for Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s visit to Bevisham, he was, he said, quite
      prepared to maintain that Mr. Romfrey had a perfect justification for his
      conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia hinted at barbarism. The colonel hinted at high police duties that
      gentlemen were sometimes called on to perform for the protection of
      society. &lsquo;In defiance of its laws?&rsquo; she asked; and he answered: &lsquo;Women
      must not be judging things out of their sphere,&rsquo; with the familiar accent
      on &lsquo;women&rsquo; which proves their inferiority. He was rarely guilty of it
      toward his daughter. Evidently he had resolved to back Mr. Romfrey
      blindly. That epistle of Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s merited condign punishment and had
      met with it, he seemed to rejoice in saying: and this was his abstract of
      the same: &lsquo;An old charlatan who tells his dupe to pray every night of his
      life for the beheading of kings and princes, and scattering of the clergy,
      and disbanding the army, that he and his rabble may fall upon the wealthy,
      and show us numbers win; and he&rsquo;ll undertake to make them moral!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish we were not going to Steynham,&rsquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So do I. Well, no, I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; the colonel corrected himself, &lsquo;no; it &lsquo;s an
      engagement. I gave my consent so far. We shall see whether Nevil
      Beauchamp&rsquo;s a man of any sense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heart sank. This was as much as to let her know that if Nevil broke
      with his uncle, the treaty of union between the two families, which her
      father submitted to entertain out of consideration for Mr. Romfrey, would
      be at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind had fallen. Entering her river, Cecilia gazed back at the smooth
      broad water, and the band of golden beams flung across it from the evening
      sun over the forest. No little cutter was visible. She could not write to
      Nevil to bid him come and concert with her in what spirit to encounter his
      uncle Everard at Steynham. And guests would be at Mount Laurels next day;
      Lord Lockrace, Lord Croyston, and the Lespels; she could not drive down to
      Bevisham on the chance of seeing him. Nor was it to be acknowledged even
      to herself that she so greatly desired to see him and advise him. Why not?
      Because she was one of the artificial creatures called women (with the
      accent) who dare not be spontaneous, and cannot act independently if they
      would continue to be admirable in the world&rsquo;s eye, and who for that object
      must remain fixed on shelves, like other marketable wares, avoiding motion
      to avoid shattering or tarnishing. This is their fate, only in degree less
      inhuman than that of Hellenic and Trojan princesses offered up to the
      Gods, or pretty slaves to the dealers. Their artificiality is at once
      their bane and their source of superior pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seymour Austin might have reason for seeking to emancipate them, she
      thought, and blushed in thought that she could never be learning anything
      but from her own immediate sensations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course it was in her power to write to Beauchamp, just as it had been
      in his to speak to her, but the fire was wanting in her blood and absent
      from his mood, so they were kept apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father knew as little as she what was the positive cause of Mr.
      Romfrey&rsquo;s chastisement of Dr. Shrapnel. &lsquo;Cause enough, I don&rsquo;t doubt,&rsquo; he
      said, and cited the mephitic letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was not given to suspicions, or she would have had them kindled by
      a certain wilfulness in his incessant reference to the letter, and
      exoneration, if not approval, of Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      How did that chivalrous gentleman justify himself for condescending to
      such an extreme as the use of personal violence? Was there a possibility
      of his justifying it to Nevil? She was most wretched in her reiteration of
      these inquiries, for, with a heart subdued, she had still a mind whose
      habit of independent judgement was not to be constrained, and while she
      felt that it was only by siding with Nevil submissively and blindly in
      this lamentable case that she could hope for happiness, she foresaw the
      likelihood of her not being able to do so as much as he would desire and
      demand. This she took for the protest of her pure reason. In reality,
      grieved though she was on account of that Dr. Shrapnel, her captive heart
      resented the anticipated challenge to her to espouse his cause or
      languish.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. THE FIRST ENCOUNTER AT STEYNHAM
    </h2>
    <p>
      The judge pronouncing sentence of condemnation on the criminal is
      proverbially a sorrowfully-minded man; and still more would he be so had
      he to undertake the part of executioner as well. This is equivalent to
      saying that the simple pleasures are no longer with us; it must be a
      personal enemy now to give us any satisfaction in chastising and slaying.
      Perhaps by-and-by that will be savourless: we degenerate. There is,
      nevertheless, ever (and let nature be praised for it) a strong sustainment
      in the dutiful exertion of our physical energies, and Mr. Everard Romfrey
      experienced it after he had fulfilled his double office on the person of
      Dr. Shrapnel by carrying out his own decree. His conscience approved him
      cheerlessly, as it is the habit of that secret monitor to do when we have
      no particular advantage coming of the act we have performed; but the
      righteous labour of his arm gave him high breathing and an appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      He foresaw that he and Nevil would soon be having a wrestle over the
      matter, hand and thigh; but a gentleman in the right engaged with a fellow
      in the wrong has nothing to apprehend; is, in fact, in the position of a
      game-preserver with a poacher. The nearest approach to gratification in
      that day&rsquo;s work which Mr. Romfrey knew was offered by the picture of
      Nevil&rsquo;s lamentable attitude above his dirty idol. He conceived it in the
      mock-mediaeval style of our caricaturists:&mdash;Shrapnel stretched at his
      length, half a league, in slashed yellows and blacks, with his bauble
      beside him, and prodigious pointed toes; Nevil in parti-coloured tights,
      on one leg, raising his fists in imprecation to a nose in the firmament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gentlemen of an unpractised imaginative capacity cannot vision for
      themselves exactly what they would, being unable to exercise authority
      over the proportions and the hues of the objects they conceive, which are
      very much at the mercy of their sportive caprices; and the state of mind
      of Mr. Romfrey is not to be judged by his ridiculous view of the pair. In
      the abstract he could be sorry for Shrapnel. As he knew himself
      magnanimous, he promised himself to be forbearing with Nevil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, the month of September was drawing nigh; he had plenty to think
      of. The entire land (signifying all but all of those who occupy the
      situation of thinkers in it) may be said to have been exhaling the same
      thought in connection with September. Our England holds possession of a
      considerable portion of the globe, and it keeps the world in awe to see
      her bestowing so considerable a portion of her intelligence upon her
      recreations. To prosecute them with her whole heart is an ingenious
      exhibition of her power. Mr. Romfrey was of those who said to his
      countrymen, &lsquo;Go yachting; go cricketing; go boat-racing; go shooting; go
      horseracing, nine months of the year, while the other Europeans go
      marching and drilling.&rsquo; Those occupations he considered good for us; and
      our much talking, writing, and thinking about them characteristic, and
      therefore good. And he was not one of those who do penance for that
      sweating indolence in the fits of desperate panic. Beauchamp&rsquo;s argument
      that the rich idler begets the idling vagabond, the rich wagerer the
      brutal swindler, the general thirst for a mad round of recreation a
      generally-increasing disposition to avoid serious work, and the unbraced
      moral tone of the country an indifference to national responsibility (an
      argument doubtless extracted from Shrapnel, talk tall as the very
      demagogue when he stood upright), Mr. Romfrey laughed at scornfully,
      affirming that our manufactures could take care of themselves. As for
      invasion, we are circled by the sea. Providence has done that for us, and
      may be relied on to do more in an emergency.&mdash;The children of wealth
      and the children of the sun alike believe that Providence is for them, and
      it would seem that the former can do without it less than the latter,
      though the former are less inclined to give it personification.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year, however, the array of armaments on the Continent made Mr.
      Romfrey anxious about our navy. Almost his first topic in welcoming
      Colonel Halkett and Cecilia to Steynham was the rottenness of navy
      administration; for if Providence is to do anything for us it must have a
      sea-worthy fleet for the operation. How loudly would his contemptuous
      laughter have repudiated the charge that he trusted to supernatural agency
      for assistance in case of need! But so it was: and he owned to believing
      in English luck. Partly of course he meant that steady fire of combat
      which his countrymen have got heated to of old till fortune blessed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil is not here?&rsquo; the colonel asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I suspect he&rsquo;s gruelling and plastering a doctor of his
      acquaintance,&rsquo; Mr. Romfrey said, with his nasal laugh composed of scorn
      and resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, I&rsquo;ve heard,&rsquo; said Colonel Halkett hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have liked to be informed of Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s particular offence:
      he mentioned the execrable letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Romfrey complacently interjected: &lsquo;Drug-vomit!&rsquo; and after an interval:
      &lsquo;Gallows!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That man has done Nevil Beauchamp a world of mischief, Romfrey.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll hope for a cure, colonel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did the man come across you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Romfrey was mute on the subject. Colonel Halkett abstained from
      pushing his inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia could only tell her father when they were alone in the
      drawing-room a few minutes before dinner that Mrs. Culling was entirely
      ignorant of any cause to which Nevil&rsquo;s absence might be attributed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Romfrey had good cause,&rsquo; the colonel said, emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      He repeated it next day, without being a bit wiser of the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia&rsquo;s happiness or hope was too sensitive to allow of a beloved
      father&rsquo;s deceiving her in his opposition to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw clearly now that he had fastened on this miserable incident,
      expecting an imbroglio that would divide Nevil and his uncle, and be an
      excuse for dividing her and Nevil. O for the passionate will to make head
      against what appeared as a fate in this matter! She had it not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Wardour-Devereux, Sir John and Lady Baskelett, and the
      Countess of Welshpool, another sister of Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s, arrived at
      Steynham for a day and a night. Lady Baskelett and Lady Welshpool came to
      see their brother, not to countenance his household; and Mr.
      Wardour-Devereux could not stay longer than a certain number of hours
      under a roof where tobacco was in evil odour. From her friend Louise, his
      wife, Cecilia learnt that Mr. Lydiard had been summoned to Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s
      bedside, as Mrs. Devereux knew by a letter she had received from Mr.
      Lydiard, who was no political devotee of that man, she assured Cecilia,
      but had an extraordinary admiration for the Miss Denham living with him.
      This was kindly intended to imply that Beauchamp was released from his
      attendance on Dr. Shrapnel, and also that it was not he whom the Miss
      Denham attracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is in Switzerland,&rsquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is better there,&rsquo; said Mrs. Devereux.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stukely Culbrett succeeded to these visitors. He heard of the case of
      Dr. Shrapnel from Colonel Halkett, and of Beauchamp&rsquo;s missing of his
      chance with the heiress from Mr. Romfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund Culling was in great perplexity about Beauchamp&rsquo;s prolonged
      absence; for he had engaged to come, he had written to her to say he would
      be sure to come; and she feared he was ill. She would have persuaded Mr.
      Culbrett to go down to Bevisham to see him: she declared that she could
      even persuade herself to call on Dr. Shrapnel a second time, in spite of
      her horror of the man. Her anger at the thought of his keeping Nevil away
      from good fortune and happiness caused her to speak in resentment and
      loathing of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He behaved badly when you saw him, did he?&rsquo; said Stukely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Badly, is no word. He is detestable,&rsquo; Rosamund replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think he ought to be whipped?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She feigned an extremity of vindictiveness, and twisted her brows in comic
      apology for the unfeminine sentiment, as she said: &lsquo;I really do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The feminine gentleness of her character was known to Stukely, so she
      could afford to exaggerate the expression of her anger, and she did not
      modify it, forgetful that a woman is the representative of the sex with
      cynical men, and escapes from contempt at the cost of her sisterhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking out of an upper window in the afternoon she beheld Nevil Beauchamp
      in a group with his uncle Everard, the colonel and Cecilia, and Mr.
      Culbrett. Nevil was on his feet; the others were seated under the great
      tulip-tree on the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little observation of them warned her that something was wrong. There
      was a vacant chair; Nevil took it in his hand at times, stamped it to the
      ground, walked away and sharply back fronting his uncle, speaking
      vehemently, she perceived, and vainly, as she judged by the cast of his
      uncle&rsquo;s figure. Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s head was bent, and wagged slightly, as he
      screwed his brows up and shot his eyes, queerly at the agitated young man.
      Colonel Halkett&rsquo;s arms crossed his chest. Cecilia&rsquo;s eyelids drooped their
      lashes. Mr. Culbrett was balancing on the hind-legs of his chair. No one
      appeared to be speaking but Nevil.
    </p>
    <p>
      It became evident that Nevil was putting a series of questions to his
      uncle. Mechanical nods were given him in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Mr. Romfrey rose, thundering out a word or two, without a
      gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevil flung his hand out straight to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Romfrey seemed to consent; the colonel shook his head: Nevil insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      A footman carrying a tea-tray to Miss Halkett received some commission and
      swiftly disappeared, making Rosamund wonder whether sugar, milk or cream
      had been omitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She met him on the first landing, and heard that Mr. Romfrey requested her
      to step out on the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Expecting to hear of a piece of misconduct on the part of the household
      servants, she hurried forth, and found that she had to traverse the whole
      space of the lawn up to the tuliptree. Colonel Halkett and Mr. Romfrey had
      resumed their seats. The colonel stood up and bowed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Romfrey said: &lsquo;One question to you, ma&rsquo;am, and you shall not be
      detained. Did not that man Shrapnel grossly insult you on the day you
      called on him to see Captain Beauchamp about a couple of months before the
      Election?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look at me when you speak, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whiteness of his face paralyzed her tongue. A dreadful levelling of
      his eyes penetrated and chilled her. Instead of thinking of her answer she
      thought of what could possibly have happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did he insult you at all, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Romfrey reminded him that he was not a cross-examining criminal
      barrister.
    </p>
    <p>
      They waited for her to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, coloured, betrayed confusion; her senses telling her of a
      catastrophe, her conscience accusing her as the origin of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did Dr. Shrapnel, to your belief, intentionally hurt your feelings or
      your dignity?&rsquo; said Beauchamp, and made the answer easier:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not intentionally, surely: not... I certainly do not accuse him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you tell me you feel that he wounded you in the smallest degree? And
      if so, how? I ask you this, because he is anxious, if he lives, to
      apologize to you for any offence that he may have been guilty of: he was
      ignorant of it. I have his word for that, and his commands to me to bear
      it to you. I may tell you I have never known him injure the most feeble
      thing&mdash;anything alive, or wish to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp&rsquo;s voice choked. Rosamund saw tears leap out of the stern face of
      her dearest now in wrath with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he ill?&rsquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is. You own to a strong dislike of him, do you not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But not to desire any harm to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a whipping,&rsquo; Mr. Culbrett murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everard Romfrey overheard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had allowed Mrs. Culling to be sent for, that she might with a bare
      affirmative silence Nevil, when his conduct was becoming intolerable
      before the guests of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That will do, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; he dismissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp would not let her depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must have your distinct reply, and in Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s presence:&mdash;say,
      that if you accused him you were mistaken, or that they were mistaken who
      supposed you had accused him. I must have the answer before you go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir, will you learn manners!&rsquo; Mr. Romfrey said to him, with a rattle of
      the throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp turned his face from-her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett offered her his arm to lead her away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it? Oh, what is it?&rsquo; she whispered, scarcely able to walk, but
      declining the colonel&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ought not to have been dragged out here,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Any one might
      have known there would be no convincing of Captain Beauchamp. That old
      rascal in Bevisham has been having a beating; that&rsquo;s all. And a very
      beautiful day it is!&mdash;a little too hot, though. Before we leave, you
      must give me a lesson or two in gardening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dr. Shrapnel&mdash;Mr. Romfrey!&rsquo; said Rosamund half audibly under the
      oppression of the more she saw than what she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel talked of her renown in landscape-gardening. He added
      casually: &lsquo;They met the other day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By accident?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By chance, I suppose. Shrapnel defends one of your Steynham poaching
      vermin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Romfrey struck him?&mdash;for that? Oh, never!&rsquo; Rosamund exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose he had a long account to settle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She fetched her breath painfully. &lsquo;I shall never be forgiven.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I say that a gentleman has no business with idols,&rsquo; the colonel fumed
      as he spoke. &lsquo;Those letters of Shrapnel to Nevil Beauchamp are a scandal
      on the name of Englishman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have read that shocking one, Colonel Halkett?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Captain Baskelett read it out to us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He? Oh! then...&rsquo; She stopped:&mdash;Then the author of this mischief is
      clear to me! her divining hatred of Cecil would have said, but her humble
      position did not warrant such speech. A consideration of the lowliness
      necessitating this restraint at a moment when loudly to denounce another&rsquo;s
      infamy with triumphant insight would have solaced and supported her, kept
      Rosamund dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not bear to think of her part in the mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not bound to think of it, knowing actually nothing of the
      occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still she felt that she was on her trial. She detected herself running in
      and out of her nature to fortify it against accusations rather than
      cleanse it for inspection. It was narrowing in her own sight. The prospect
      of her having to submit to a further interrogatory, shut it up entrenched
      in the declaration that Dr. Shrapnel had so far outraged her sentiments as
      to be said to have offended her: not insulted, perhaps, but certainly
      offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was a generous distinction. It was generous; and, having
      recognized the generosity, she was unable to go beyond it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was presently making the distinction to Miss Halkett. The colonel had
      left her at the door of the house: Miss Halkett sought admission to her
      private room on an errand of condolence, for she had sympathized with her
      very much in the semi-indignity Nevil had forced her to undergo: and very
      little indeed had she been able to sympathize with Nevil, who had been
      guilty of the serious fault of allowing himself to appear moved by his own
      commonplace utterances; or, in other words, the theme being hostile to his
      audience, he had betrayed emotion over it without first evoking the spirit
      of pathos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As for me,&rsquo; Rosamund replied, to some comforting remarks of Miss
      Halkett&rsquo;s, &lsquo;I do not understand why I should be mixed up in Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s
      misfortunes: I really am quite unable to recollect his words to me or his
      behaviour: I have only a positive impression that I left his house, where
      I had gone to see Captain Beauchamp, in utter disgust, so repelled by his
      language that I could hardly trust myself to speak of the man to Mr.
      Romfrey when he questioned me. I did not volunteer it. I am ready to say
      that I believe Dr. Shrapnel did not intend to be insulting. I cannot say
      that he was not offensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      You know, Miss Halkett, I would willingly, gladly have saved him from
      anything like punishment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are too gentle to have thought of it,&rsquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I shall never be forgiven by Captain Beauchamp. I see in his eyes
      that he accuses me and despises me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He will not be so unjust, Mrs. Culling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund begged that she might hear what Nevil had first said on his
      arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia related that they had seen him walking swiftly across the park,
      and that Mr. Romfrey had hailed him, and held his hand out; and that
      Captain Beauchamp had overlooked it, saying he feared Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s work
      was complete. He had taken her father&rsquo;s hand and hers and his touch was
      like ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His worship of that Dr. Shrapnel is extraordinary,&rsquo; quoth Rosamund. &lsquo;And
      how did Mr. Romfrey behave to him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My father thinks, very forbearingly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund sighed and made a semblance of wringing her hands. &lsquo;It seems to
      me that I anticipated ever since I heard of the man... or at least ever
      since I saw him and heard him, he would be the evil genius of us all: if I
      dare include myself. But I am not permitted to escape! And, Miss Halkett,
      can you tell me how it was that my name&mdash;that I became involved? I
      cannot imagine the circumstances which would bring me forward in this
      unhappy affair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia replied: &lsquo;The occasion was, that Captain Beauchamp so scornfully
      contrasted the sort of injury done by Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s defence of a poacher
      on his uncle&rsquo;s estate, with the severe chastisement inflicted by Mr.
      Romfrey in revenge for it. He would not leave the subject.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see him&mdash;see his eyes!&rsquo; cried Rosamund, her bosom heaving and
      sinking deep, as her conscience quavered within her. &lsquo;At last Mr. Romfrey
      mentioned me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He stood up and said you had been personally insulted by Dr. Shrapnel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund meditated in a distressing doubt of her conscientious
      truthfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Captain Beauchamp will be coming to me; and how can I answer him? Heaven
      knows I would have shielded the poor man, if possible&mdash;poor wretch!
      Wicked though he is, one has only to hear of him suffering! But what can I
      answer? I do recollect now that Mr. Romfrey compelled me from question to
      question to confess that the man had vexed me. Insulted, I never said. At
      the worst, I said vexed. I would not have said insulted, or even offended,
      because Mr. Romfrey... ah! we know him. What I did say, I forget. I have
      no guide to what I said but my present feelings, and they are pity for the
      unfortunate man much more than dislike.&mdash;Well, I must go through the
      scene with Nevil!&rsquo; Rosamund concluded her outcry of ostensible
      exculpation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked in a cooler moment how it was that Captain Beauchamp had so far
      forgotten himself as to burst out on his uncle before the guests of the
      house. It appeared that he had wished his uncle to withdraw with him, and
      Mr. Romfrey had bidden him postpone private communications. Rosamund
      gathered from one or two words of Cecilia&rsquo;s that Mr. Romfrey, until
      finally stung by Nevil, had indulged in his best-humoured banter.

      CHAPTER XXXIV. THE FACE OF RENEE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Shortly before the ringing of the dinner-bell Rosamund knocked at
      Beauchamp&rsquo;s dressing-room door, the bearer of a telegram from Bevisham. He
      read it in one swift run of the eyes, and said: &lsquo;Come in, ma&rsquo;am, I have
      something for you. Madame de Rouaillout sends you this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund saw her name written in a French hand on the back of the card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You stay with us, Nevil?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-night and to-morrow, perhaps. The danger seems to be over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has Dr. Shrapnel been in danger?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has. If it&rsquo;s quite over now!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I declare to you, Nevil...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen to me, ma&rsquo;am; I&rsquo;m in the dark about this murderous business:&mdash;an
      old man, defenceless, harmless as a child!&mdash;but I know this, that you
      are somewhere in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil, do you not guess at some one else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He! yes, he! But Cecil Baskelett led no blind man to Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s
      gate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil, as I live, I knew nothing of it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, but you set fire to the train. You hated the old man, and you taught
      Mr. Romfrey to think that you had been insulted. I see it all. Now you
      must have the courage to tell him of your error. There&rsquo;s no other course
      for you. I mean to take Mr. Romfrey to Dr. Shrapnel, to save the honour of
      our family, as far as it can be saved.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What? Nevil!&rsquo; exclaimed Rosamund, gaping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems little enough, ma&rsquo;am. But he must go. I will have the apology
      spoken, and man to man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you would never tell your uncle that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed in his uncle&rsquo;s manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Nevil, my dearest, forgive me, I think of you&mdash;why are the
      Halketts here? It is not entirely with Colonel Halkett&rsquo;s consent. It is
      your uncle&rsquo;s influence with him that gives you your chance. Do you not
      care to avail yourself of it? Ever since he heard Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s letter to
      you, Colonel Halkett has, I am sure, been tempted to confound you with him
      in his mind: ah! Nevil, but recollect that it is only Mr. Romfrey who can
      help to give you your Cecilia. There is no dispensing with him. Postpone
      your attempt to humiliate&mdash;I mean, that is, Oh! Nevil, whatever you
      intend to do to overcome your uncle, trust to time, be friends with him;
      be a little worldly! for her sake! to ensure her happiness!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp obtained the information that his cousin Cecil had read out the
      letter of Dr. Shrapnel at Mount Laurels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you imagine I should sit at my uncle&rsquo;s table if I did not intend to
      force him to repair the wrong he has done to himself and to us?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Nevil, do you not see Captain Baskelett at work here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What amends can Cecil Baskelett make? My uncle is a man of honour: it is
      in his power. There, I leave you to speak to him; you will do it to-night,
      after we break up in the drawing-room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund groaned: &lsquo;An apology to Dr. Shrapnel from Mr. Romfrey! It is an
      impossibility, Nevil! utter!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you say to sit idle: but do as I tell you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had barely reproached her. She wondered at that; and then remembered
      his alien sad half-smile in quitting the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund would not present herself at her lord&rsquo;s dinner-table when there
      were any guests at Steynham. She prepared to receive Miss Halkett in the
      drawing-room, as the guests of the house this evening chanced to be her
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Rouaillout&rsquo;s present to her was a photograph of M. de Croisnel,
      his daughter and son in a group. Rosamund could not bear to look at the
      face of Renee, and she put it out of sight. But she had looked. She was
      reduced to look again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roland stood beside his father&rsquo;s chair; Renee sat at his feet, clasping
      his right hand. M. de Croisnel&rsquo;s fallen eyelids and unshorn white chin
      told the story of the family reunion. He was dying: his two children were
      nursing him to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decidedly Cecilia was a more beautiful woman than Renee: but on which does
      the eye linger longest&mdash;which draws the heart? a radiant landscape,
      where the tall ripe wheat flashes between shadow and shine in the stately
      march of Summer, or the peep into dewy woodland on to dark water?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dark-eyed Renee was not beauty but attraction; she touched the double
      chords within us which are we know not whether harmony or discord, but a
      divine discord if an uncertified harmony, memorable beyond plain sweetness
      or majesty. There are touches of bliss in anguish that superhumanize
      bliss, touches of mystery in simplicity, of the eternal in the variable.
      These two chords of poignant antiphony she struck throughout the range of
      the hearts of men, and strangely intervolved them in vibrating unison.
      Only to look at her face, without hearing her voice, without the charm of
      her speech, was to feel it. On Cecilia&rsquo;s entering the drawing-room sofa,
      while the gentlemen drank claret, Rosamund handed her the card of the
      photographic artist of Tours, mentioning no names.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should say the portrait is correct. A want of spirituality,&rsquo; Rosamund
      said critically, using one of the insular commonplaces, after that manner
      of fastening upon what there is not in a piece of Art or nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia&rsquo;s avidity to see and study the face preserved her at a higher
      mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew the person instantly; had no occasion to ask who this was. She
      sat over the portrait blushing burningly: &lsquo;And that is a brother?&rsquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is her brother Roland, and very like her, except in complexion,&rsquo; 
      said Rosamund.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia murmured of a general resemblance in the features. Renee enchained
      her. Though but a sun-shadow, the vividness of this French face came out
      surprisingly; air was in the nostrils and speech flew from the tremulous
      mouth. The eyes? were they quivering with internal light, or were they set
      to seem so in the sensitive strange curves of the eyelids whose awakened
      lashes appeared to tremble on some borderland between lustreful
      significance and the mists? She caught at the nerves like certain aoristic
      combinations in music, like tones of a stringed instrument swept by the
      wind, enticing, unseizable. Yet she sat there at her father&rsquo;s feet gazing
      out into the world indifferent to spectators, indifferent even to the
      common sentiment of gracefulness. Her left hand clasped his right, and she
      supported herself on the floor with the other hand leaning away from him,
      to the destruction of conventional symmetry in the picture. None but a
      woman of consummate breeding dared have done as she did. It was not
      Southern suppleness that saved her from the charge of harsh audacity, but
      something of the kind of genius in her mood which has hurried the greater
      poets of sound and speech to impose their naturalness upon accepted laws,
      or show the laws to have been our meagre limitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writer in this country will, however, be made safest, and the
      excellent body of self-appointed thongmen, who walk up and down our ranks
      flapping their leathern straps to terrorize us from experiments in
      imagery, will best be satisfied, by the statement that she was
      indescribable: a term that exacts no labour of mind from him or from them,
      for it flows off the pen as readily as it fills a vacuum.
    </p>
    <p>
      That posture of Renee displeased Cecilia and fascinated her. In an
      exhibition of paintings she would have passed by it in pure displeasure:
      but here was Nevil&rsquo;s first love, the woman who loved him; and she was
      French. After a continued study of her Cecilia&rsquo;s growing jealousy betrayed
      itself in a conscious rivalry of race, coming to the admission that
      Englishwomen cannot fling themselves about on the floor without agonizing
      the graces: possibly, too, they cannot look singularly without risks in
      the direction of slyness and brazen archness; or talk animatedly without
      dipping in slang. Conventional situations preserve them and interchange
      dignity with them; still life befits them; pre-eminently that judicial
      seat from which in briefest speech they deliver their judgements upon
      their foreign sisters. Jealousy it was that plucked Cecilia from her
      majestic place and caused her to envy in Renee things she would otherwise
      have disapproved.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she had seen the French lady&rsquo;s likeness! The effect of it was a
      horrid trouble in Cecilia&rsquo;s cool blood, abasement, a sense of eclipse,
      hardly any sense of deserving worthiness: &lsquo;What am I but an heiress!&rsquo; 
      Nevil had once called her beautiful; his praise had given her beauty. But
      what is beauty when it is outshone! Ask the owners of gems. You think them
      rich; they are pining.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, too, this Renee, who looked electrical in repose, might really love
      Nevil with a love that sent her heart out to him in his enterprises,
      justifying and adoring him, piercing to the hero in his very thoughts.
      Would she not see that his championship of the unfortunate man Dr.
      Shrapnel was heroic?
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia surrendered the card to Rosamund, and it was out of sight when
      Beauchamp stepped in the drawing-room. His cheeks were flushed; he had
      been one against three for the better part of an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you going to show me the downs to-morrow morning?&rsquo; Cecilia said to
      him; and he replied, &lsquo;You will have to be up early.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; asked the colonel, at Beauchamp&rsquo;s heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was volunteering to join the party of two for the early morning&rsquo;s ride
      to the downs. Mr. Romfrey pressed his shoulder, saying, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no third
      horse can do it in my stables.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had your promise to come over the kennels with me and see how I treat a
      cry of mad dog, which is ninety-nine times out of a hundred mad fool man,&rsquo; 
      Mr. Romfrey added.
    </p>
    <p>
      By that the colonel knew he meant to stand by Nevil still and offer him
      his chance of winning Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having pledged his word not to interfere, Colonel Halkett submitted, and
      muttered, &lsquo;Ah! the kennels.&rsquo; Considering however what he had been
      witnessing of Nevil&rsquo;s behaviour to his uncle, the colonel was amazed at
      Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s magnanimity in not cutting him off and disowning him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why the downs?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why the deuce, colonel?&rsquo; A question quite as reasonable, and Mr. Romfrey
      laughed under his breath. To relieve an uncertainty in Cecilia&rsquo;s face,
      that might soon have become confusion, he described the downs fronting the
      paleness of earliest dawn, and then their arch and curve and dip against
      the pearly grey of the half-glow; and then, among their hollows, lo, the
      illumination of the East all around, and up and away, and a gallop for
      miles along the turfy thymy rolling billows, land to left, sea to right,
      below you. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the nearest hit to wings we can make, Cecilia.&rsquo; He
      surprised her with her Christian name, which kindled in her the secret of
      something he expected from that ride on the downs. Compare you the Alps
      with them? If you could jump on the back of an eagle, you might. The Alps
      have height. But the downs have swiftness. Those long stretching lines of
      the downs are greyhounds in full career. To look at them is to set the
      blood racing! Speed is on the downs, glorious motion, odorous air of sea
      and herb, exquisite as in the isles of Greece. And the Continental
      travelling ninnies leave England for health!&mdash;run off and forth from
      the downs to the steamboat, the railway, the steaming hotel, the tourist&rsquo;s
      shivering mountain-top, in search of sensations! There on the downs the
      finest and liveliest are at their bidding ready to fly through them like
      hosts of angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke somewhat in that strain, either to relieve Cecilia or prepare the
      road for Nevil, not in his ordinary style; on the contrary, with a swing
      of enthusiasm that seemed to spring of ancient heartfelt fervours. And
      indeed soon afterward he was telling her that there on those downs, in
      full view of Steynham, he and his wife had first joined hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp sat silent. Mr. Romfrey despatched orders to the stables, and
      Rosamund to the kitchen. Cecilia was rather dismayed by the formal
      preparations for the ride. She declined the early cup of coffee. Mr.
      Romfrey begged her to take it. &lsquo;Who knows the hour when you &lsquo;ll be back?&rsquo; 
      he said. Beauchamp said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room grew insufferable to Cecilia. She would have liked to be wafted
      to her chamber in a veil, so shamefully unveiled did she seem to be. But
      the French lady would have been happy in her place! Her father kissed her
      as fathers do when they hand the bride into the travelling-carriage. His
      &lsquo;Good-night, my darling!&rsquo; was in the voice of a soldier on duty. For a
      concluding sign that her dim apprehensions pointed correctly, Mr. Romfrey
      kissed her on the forehead. She could not understand how it had come to
      pass that she found herself suddenly on this incline, precipitated whither
      she would fain be going, only less hurriedly, less openly, and with her
      secret merely peeping, like a dove in the breast.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV. THE RIDE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      That pure opaque of the line of downs ran luminously edged against the
      pearly morning sky, with its dark landward face crepusculine yet clear in
      every combe, every dotting copse and furze-bush, every wavy fall, and the
      ripple, crease, and rill-like descent of the turf. Beauty of darkness was
      there, as well as beauty of light above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp and Cecilia rode forth before the sun was over the line, while
      the West and North-west sides of the rolling downs were stamped with such
      firmness of dusky feature as you see on the indentations of a shield of
      tarnished silver. The mounting of the sun behind threw an obscurer gloom,
      and gradually a black mask overcame them, until the rays shot among their
      folds and windings, and shadows rich as the black pansy, steady as on a
      dialplate rounded with the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Everard Romfrey embraced this view from Steynham windows, and loved
      it. The lengths of gigantic &lsquo;greyhound backs&rsquo; coursing along the South
      were his vision of delight; no image of repose for him, but of the life in
      swiftness. He had known them when the great bird of the downs was not a
      mere tradition, and though he owned conscientiously to never having beheld
      the bird, a certain mystery of holiness hung about the region where the
      bird had been in his time. There, too, with a timely word he had gained a
      wealthy and good wife. He had now sent Nevil to do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      This astute gentleman had caught at the idea of a ride of the young couple
      to the downs with his customary alacrity of perception as being the very
      best arrangement for hurrying them to the point. At Steynham Nevil was
      sure to be howling all day over his tumbled joss Shrapnel. Once away in
      the heart of the downs, and Cecilia beside him, it was a matter of
      calculation that two or three hours of the sharpening air would screw his
      human nature to the pitch. In fact, unless each of them was reluctant,
      they could hardly return unbetrothed. Cecilia&rsquo;s consent was foreshadowed
      by her submission in going: Mr. Romfrey had noticed her fright at the
      suggestive formalities he cast round the expedition, and felt sure of her.
      Taking Nevil for a man who could smell the perfume of a ripe affirmative
      on the sweetest of lips, he was pretty well sure of him likewise. And then
      a truce to all that Radical rageing and hot-pokering of the country! and
      lie in peace, old Shrapnel! and get on your legs when you can, and offend
      no more; especially be mindful not to let fly one word against a woman!
      With Cecilia for wife, and a year of marriage devoted to a son and heir,
      Nevil might be expected to resume his duties as a naval officer, and win
      an honourable name for the inheritance of the young one he kissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was benevolence in these previsions of Mr. Romfrey, proving how good
      it is for us to bow to despotic authority, if only we will bring ourselves
      unquestioningly to accept the previous deeds of the directing hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett gave up his daughter for lost when she did not appear at
      the breakfast-table: for yet more decidedly lost when the luncheon saw her
      empty place; and as time drew on toward the dinner-hour, he began to think
      her lost beyond hope, embarked for good and all with the madbrain. Some
      little hope of a dissension between the pair, arising from the natural
      antagonism of her strong sense to Nevil&rsquo;s extravagance, had buoyed him
      until it was evident that they must have alighted at an inn to eat, which
      signified that they had overleaped the world and its hurdles, and were as
      dreamy a leash of lovers as ever made a dreamland of hard earth. The downs
      looked like dreamland through the long afternoon. They shone as in a veil
      of silk-softly fair, softly dark. No spot of harshness was on them save
      where a quarry South-westward gaped at the evening sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Red light struck into that round chalk maw, and the green slopes and
      channels and half-circle hollows were brought a mile-stride higher
      Steynham by the level beams.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor old colonel fell to a more frequent repetition of the &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; 
      with which he had been unconsciously expressing his perplexed mind in the
      kennels and through the covers during the day. None of the gentlemen went
      to dress. Mr. Culbrett was indoors conversing with Rosamund Culling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s come to them?&rsquo; the colonel asked of Mr. Romfrey, who said
      shrugging, &lsquo;Something wrong with one of the horses.&rsquo; It had happened to
      him on one occasion to set foot in the hole of a baked hedgehog that had
      furnished a repast, not without succulence, to some shepherd of the downs.
      Such a case might have recurred; it was more likely to cause an upset at a
      walk than at a gallop: or perhaps a shoe had been cast; and young people
      break no bones at a walking fall; ten to one if they do at their top
      speed. Horses manage to kill their seniors for them: the young are exempt
      from accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett nodded and sighed: &lsquo;I daresay they&rsquo;re safe. It&rsquo;s that man
      Shrapnel&rsquo;s letter&mdash;that letter, Romfrey! A private letter, I know;
      but I&rsquo;ve not heard Nevil disown the opinions expressed in it. I submit.
      It&rsquo;s no use resisting. I treat my daughter as a woman capable of judging
      for herself. I repeat, I submit. I haven&rsquo;t a word against Nevil except on
      the score of his politics. I like him. All I have to say is, I don&rsquo;t
      approve of a republican and a sceptic for my son-in-law. I yield to you,
      and my daughter, if she...!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think she does, colonel. Marriage &lsquo;ll cure the fellow. Nevil will
      slough his craze. Off! old coat. Cissy will drive him in strings. &ldquo;My
      wife!&rdquo; I hear him.&rsquo; Mr. Romfrey laughed quietly. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all &ldquo;my country,&rdquo;
       now. The dog&rsquo;ll be uxorious. He wants fixing; nothing worse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How he goes on about Shrapnel!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think much of him if he didn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re one in a thousand, Romfrey. I object to seeing a man worshipped.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Nevil&rsquo;s green-sickness, and Shrapnel&rsquo;s the god of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I trust to heaven you&rsquo;re right. It seems to me young fellows ought to be
      out of it earlier.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They generally are.&rsquo; Mr. Romfrey named some of the processes by which
      they are relieved of brain-flightiness, adding philosophically, &lsquo;This way
      or that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His quick ear caught a sound of hoofs cantering down the avenue on the
      Northern front of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He consulted his watch. &lsquo;Ten minutes to eight. Say a quarter-past for
      dinner. They&rsquo;re here, colonel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Romfrey met Nevil returning from the stables. Cecilia had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Had a good day?&rsquo; said Mr. Romfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp replied: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you of it after dinner,&rsquo; and passed by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Romfrey edged round to Colonel Halkett, conjecturing in his mind: They
      have not hit it; as he remarked: &lsquo;Breakfast and luncheon have been omitted
      in this day&rsquo;s fare,&rsquo; which appeared to the colonel a confirmation of his
      worst fears, or rather the extinction of his last spark of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knocked at his daughter&rsquo;s door in going upstairs to dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia presented herself and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By-and-by, papa,&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;I have a headache. Beg Mr. Romfrey to
      excuse me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No news for me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no news.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Culling was with her. The colonel stepped on mystified to his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door had closed Cecilia turned to Rosamund and burst into tears.
      Rosamund felt that it must be something grave indeed for the proud young
      lady so to betray a troubled spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is ill&mdash;Dr. Shrapnel is very ill,&rsquo; Cecilia responded to one or
      two subdued inquiries in as clear a voice as she could command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where have you heard of him?&rsquo; Rosamund asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have been there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bevisham? to Bevisham?&rsquo; Rosamund was considering the opinion Mr. Romfrey
      would form of the matter from the point of view of his horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was Nevil&rsquo;s wish,&rsquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes? and you went with him,&rsquo; Rosamund encouraged her to proceed,
      gladdened at hearing her speak of Nevil by that name; &lsquo;you have not been
      on the downs at all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia mentioned a junction railway station they had ridden to; and
      thence, boxing the horses, by train to Bevisham. Rosamund understood that
      some haunting anxiety had fretted Nevil during the night; in the morning
      he could not withstand it, and he begged Cecilia to change their
      destination, apparently with a vehemence of entreaty that had been
      irresistible, or else it was utter affection for him had reduced her to
      undertake the distasteful journey. She admitted that she was not the most
      sympathetic companion Nevil could have had on the way, either going or
      coming. She had not entered Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s cottage. Remaining on horseback
      she had seen the poor man reclining in his garden chair. Mr. Lydiard was
      with him, and also his ward Miss Denham, who had been summoned by
      telegraph by one of the servants from Switzerland. And Cecilia had heard
      Nevil speak of his uncle to her, and too humbly, she hinted. Nor had the
      expression of Miss Denham&rsquo;s countenance in listening to him pleased her;
      but it was true that a heavily burdened heart cannot be expected to look
      pleasing. On the way home Cecilia had been compelled in some degree to
      defend Mr. Romfrey. Blushing through her tears at the remembrance of a
      past emotion that had been mixed with foresight, she confessed to Rosamund
      she thought it now too late to prevent a rupture between Nevil and his
      uncle. Had some one whom Nevil trusted and cared for taken counsel with
      him and advised him before uncle and nephew met to discuss this most
      unhappy matter, then there might have been hope. As it was, the fate of
      Dr. Shrapnel had gained entire possession of Nevil. Every retort of his
      uncle&rsquo;s in reference to it rose up in him: he used language of contempt
      neighbouring abhorrence: he stipulated for one sole thing to win back his
      esteem for his uncle; and that was, the apology to Dr. Shrapnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And to-night,&rsquo; Cecilia concluded, &lsquo;he will request Mr. Romfrey to
      accompany him to Bevisham to-morrow morning, to make the apology in
      person. He will not accept the slightest evasion. He thinks Dr. Shrapnel
      may die, and the honour of the family&mdash;what is it he says of it?&rsquo; 
      Cecilia raised her eyes to the ceiling, while Rosamund blinked in
      impatience and grief, just apprehending the alien state of the young
      lady&rsquo;s mind in her absence of recollection, as well as her bondage in the
      effort to recollect accurately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you not eaten any food to-day, Miss Halkett?&rsquo; she said; for it might
      be the want of food which had broken her and changed her manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia replied that she had ridden for an hour to Mount Laurels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alone? Mr. Romfrey must not hear of that,&rsquo; said Rosamund.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia consented to lie down on her bed. She declined the dainties
      Rosamund pressed on her. She was feverish with a deep and unconcealed
      affliction, and behaved as if her pride had gone. But if her pride had
      gone she would have eased her heart by sobbing outright. A similar
      division harassed her as when her friend Nevil was the candidate for
      Bevisham. She condemned his extreme wrath with his uncle, yet was
      attracted and enchained by the fire of passionate attachment which aroused
      it: and she was conscious that she had but shown obedience to his wishes
      throughout the day, not sympathy with his feelings. Under cover of a
      patient desire to please she had nursed irritation and jealousy; the
      degradation of the sense of jealousy increasing the irritation. Having
      consented to the ride to Dr. Shrapnel, should she not, to be consistent,
      have dismounted there? O half heart! A whole one, though it be an erring,
      like that of the French lady, does at least live, and has a history, and
      makes music: but the faint and uncertain is jarred in action, jarred in
      memory, ever behind the day and in the shadow of it! Cecilia reviewed
      herself: jealous, disappointed, vexed, ashamed, she had been all day a
      graceless companion, a bad actress: and at the day&rsquo;s close she was loving
      Nevil the better for what had dissatisfied, distressed, and wounded her.
      She was loving him in emulation of his devotedness to another person: and
      that other was a revolutionary common people&rsquo;s doctor! an infidel, a
      traitor to his country&rsquo;s dearest interests! But Nevil loved him, and it
      had become impossible for her not to covet the love, or to think of the
      old offender without the halo cast by Nevil&rsquo;s attachment being upon him.
      So intensely was she moved by her intertwisting reflections that in an
      access of bodily fever she stood up and moved before the glass, to behold
      the image of the woman who could be the victim of these childish emotions:
      and no wonderful contrast struck her eyes; she appeared to herself as poor
      and small as they. How could she aspire to a man like Nevil Beauchamp? If
      he had made her happy by wooing her she would not have adored him as she
      did now. He likes my hair, she said, smoothing it out, and then pressing
      her temples, like one insane. Two minutes afterward she was telling
      Rosamund her head ached less.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This terrible Dr. Shrapnel!&rsquo; Rosamund exclaimed, but reported that no
      loud voices were raised in the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett came to see his daughter, full of anxiety and curiosity.
      Affairs had been peaceful below, for he was ignorant of the expedition to
      Bevisham. On hearing of it he frowned, questioned Cecilia as to whether
      she had set foot on that man&rsquo;s grounds, then said: &lsquo;Ah! well, we leave
      to-morrow: I must go, I have business at home; I can&rsquo;t delay it. I
      sanctioned no calling there, nothing of the kind. From Steynham to
      Bevisham? Goodness, it&rsquo;s rank madness. I&rsquo;m not astonished you&rsquo;re sick and
      ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited till he was assured Cecilia had no special matter to relate, and
      recommending her to drink the tea Mrs. Culling had made for her, and then
      go to bed and sleep, he went down to the drawing-room, charged with the
      worst form of hostility toward Nevil, the partly diplomatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia smiled at her father&rsquo;s mention of sleep. She was in the contest of
      the two men, however inanimately she might be lying overhead, and the
      assurance in her mind that neither of them would give ground, so similar
      were they in their tenacity of will, dissimilar in all else, dragged her
      this way and that till she swayed lifeless between them. One may be as a
      weed of the sea while one&rsquo;s fate is being decided. To love is to be on the
      sea, out of sight of land: to love a man like Nevil Beauchamp is to be on
      the sea in tempest. Still to persist in loving would be noble, and but for
      this humiliation of utter helplessness an enviable power. Her thoughts ran
      thus in shame and yearning and regret, dimly discerning where her heart
      failed in the strength which was Nevil&rsquo;s, though it was a full heart,
      faithful and not void of courage. But he never brooded, he never blushed
      from insufficiency-the faintness of a desire, the callow passion that
      cannot fly and feed itself: he never tottered; he walked straight to his
      mark. She set up his image and Renee&rsquo;s, and cowered under the heroical
      shapes till she felt almost extinct. With her weak limbs and head
      worthlessly paining, the little infantile I within her ceased to wail,
      dwindled beyond sensation. Rosamund, waiting on her in the place of her
      maid, saw two big drops come through her closed eyelids, and thought that
      if it could be granted to Nevil to look for a moment on this fair and
      proud young lady&rsquo;s loveliness in abandonment, it would tame, melt, and
      save him. The Gods presiding over custom do not permit such renovating
      sights to men.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI. PURSUIT OF THE APOLOGY OF Mr. ROMFREY TO DR. SHRAPNEL
    </h2>
    <p>
      The contest, which was an alternation of hard hitting and close wrestling,
      had recommenced when Colonel Halkett stepped into the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Colonel, I find they&rsquo;ve been galloping to Bevisham and back,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Romfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of it,&rsquo; the colonel replied. Not perceiving a sign of
      dissatisfaction on his friend&rsquo;s face, he continued: &lsquo;To that man
      Shrapnel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cecilia did not dismount,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You took her to that man&rsquo;s gate. It was not with my sanction. You know my
      ideas of the man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you were to see him now, colonel, I don&rsquo;t think you would speak
      harshly of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We &lsquo;re not obliged to go and look on men who have, had their measure
      dealt them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Barbarously,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Romfrey in the most placid manner took a chair. &lsquo;Windy talk, that!&rsquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett seated himself. Stukely Culbrett turned a sheet of
      manuscript he was reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp began a caged lion&rsquo;s walk on the rug under the mantelpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall not spare you from hearing what I think of it, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We &lsquo;ve had what you think of it twice over,&rsquo; said Mr. Romfrey. &lsquo;I suppose
      it was the first time for information, the second time for emphasis, and
      the rest counts to keep it alive in your recollection.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is what you have to take to heart, sir; that Dr. Shrapnel is now
      seriously ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for it, and I&rsquo;ll pay the doctor&rsquo;s bill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You make it hard for me to treat you with respect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fire away. Those Radical friends of yours have to learn a lesson, and
      it&rsquo;s worth a purse to teach them that a lady, however feeble she may seem
      to them, is exactly of the strength of the best man of her acquaintance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s well said!&rsquo; came from Colonel Halkett.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp stared at him, amazed by the commendation of empty language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You acted in error; barbarously, but in error,&rsquo; he addressed his uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you have got a fine topic for mouthing,&rsquo; Mr. Romfrey rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean to sit still under Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s forgiveness?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s taken to copy the Christian religion, has he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know you were deluded when you struck him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a whit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, you know it now: Mrs. Culling&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Drag in no woman, Nevil Beauchamp!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has confessed to you that Dr. Shrapnel neither insulted her nor meant
      to ruffle her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has done no such nonsense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If she has not!&mdash;but I trust her to have done it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You play the trumpeter, you terrorize her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Into opening her lips wider; nothing else. I&rsquo;ll have the truth from her,
      and no mincing: and from Cecil Baskelett and Palmet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give Cecil a second licking, if you can, and have him off to Shrapnel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You!&rsquo; cried Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Stukely Culbrett closed the manuscript in his hands, and
      holding it out to Beauchamp, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s your letter, Nevil. It&rsquo;s tolerably hard to decipher. It&rsquo;s mild
      enough; it&rsquo;s middling good pulpit. I like it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you got there?&rsquo; Colonel Halkett asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A letter of his friend Dr. Shrapnel on the Country. Read a bit, colonel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I? That letter! Mild, do you call it?&rsquo; The colonel started back his chair
      in declining to touch the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Try it,&rsquo; said Stukely. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the letter they have been making the noise
      about. It ought to be printed. There&rsquo;s a hit or two at the middle-class
      that I should like to see in print. It&rsquo;s really not bad pulpit; and I
      suspect that what you object to, colonel, is only the dust of a
      well-thumped cushion. Shrapnel thumps with his fist. He doesn&rsquo;t say much
      that&rsquo;s new. If the parsons were men they&rsquo;d be saying it every Sunday. If
      they did, colonel, I should hear you saying, amen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait till they do say it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a long stretch. They&rsquo;re turn-cocks of one Water-company&mdash;to
      wash the greasy citizens!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re keeping Nevil on the gape;&rsquo; said Mr. Romfrey, with a whimsical
      shrewd cast of the eye at Beauchamp, who stood alert not to be foiled,
      arrow-like in look and readiness to repeat his home-shot. Mr. Romfrey
      wanted to hear more of that unintelligible &lsquo;You!&rsquo; of Beauchamp&rsquo;s. But
      Stukely Culbrett intended that the latter should be foiled, and he
      continued his diversion from the angry subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll drop the sacerdotals,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re behind a veil for us, and
      so are we for them. I&rsquo;m with you, colonel; I wouldn&rsquo;t have them
      persecuted; they sting fearfully when whipped. No one listens to them now
      except the class that goes to sleep under them, to &ldquo;set an example&rdquo; to the
      class that can&rsquo;t understand them. Shrapnel is like the breeze shaking the
      turf-grass outside the church-doors; a trifle fresher. He knocks nothing
      down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He can&rsquo;t!&rsquo; ejaculated the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He sermonizes to shake, that&rsquo;s all. I know the kind of man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank heaven, it&rsquo;s not a common species in England!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Common enough to be classed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp struck through the conversation of the pair: &lsquo;Can I see you
      alone to-night, sir, or to-morrow morning?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may catch me where you can,&rsquo; was Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s that? It&rsquo;s for your sake and mine, not for Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s. I have
      to speak to you, and must. You have done your worst with him; you can&rsquo;t
      undo it. You have to think of your honour as a gentleman. I intend to
      treat you with respect, but wolf is the title now, whether I say it or
      not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shrapnel&rsquo;s a rather long-legged sheep?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He asks for nothing from you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He would have got nothing, at a cry of peccavi!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was innocent, perfectly blameless; he would not lie to save himself.
      You mistook that for&mdash;but you were an engine shot along a line of
      rails. He does you the justice to say you acted in error.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you&rsquo;re his parrot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He pardons you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! t&rsquo; other cheek!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You went on that brute&rsquo;s errand in ignorance. Will you keep to the
      character now you know the truth? Hesitation about it doubles the infamy.
      An old man! the best of men! the kindest and truest! the most unselfish!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He tops me by half a head, and he&rsquo;s my junior.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp suffered himself to give out a groan of sick derision: &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And it was no joke holding him tight,&rsquo; said Mr. Romfrey, &lsquo;I &lsquo;d as lief
      snap an ash. The fellow (he leaned round to Colonel Halkett) must be a
      fellow of a fine constitution. And he took his punishment like a man. I&rsquo;ve
      known worse: and far worse: gentlemen by birth. There&rsquo;s the choice of
      taking it upright or fighting like a rabbit with a weasel in his hole.
      Leave him to think it over, he&rsquo;ll come right. I think no harm of him, I&rsquo;ve
      no animus. A man must have his lesson at some time of life. I did what I
      had to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here, Nevil,&rsquo; Stukely Culbrett checked Beauchamp in season: &lsquo;I beg
      to inquire what Dr. Shrapnel means by &ldquo;the people.&rdquo; We have in our country
      the nobles and the squires, and after them, as I understand it, the
      people: that&rsquo;s to say, the middle-class and the working-class&mdash;fat
      and lean. I&rsquo;m quite with Shrapnel when he lashes the fleshpots. They want
      it, and they don&rsquo;t get it from &ldquo;their organ,&rdquo; the Press. I fancy you and I
      agree about their organ; the dismallest organ that ever ground a hackneyed
      set of songs and hymns to madden the thoroughfares.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Press of our country!&rsquo; interjected Colonel Halkett in moaning
      parenthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the week-day Parson of the middle-class, colonel. They have their
      thinking done for them as the Chinese have their dancing. But, Nevil, your
      Dr. Shrapnel seems to treat the traders as identical with the aristocracy
      in opposition to his &ldquo;people.&rdquo; The traders are the cursed middlemen, bad
      friends of the &ldquo;people,&rdquo; and infernally treacherous to the nobles till
      money hoists them. It&rsquo;s they who pull down the country. They hold up the
      nobles to the hatred of the democracy, and the democracy to scare the
      nobles. One&rsquo;s when they want to swallow a privilege, and the other&rsquo;s when
      they want to ring-fence their gains. How is it Shrapnel doesn&rsquo;t expose the
      trick? He must see through it. I like that letter of his. People is one of
      your Radical big words that burst at a query. He can&rsquo;t mean Quince, and
      Bottom, and Starveling, Christopher Sly, Jack Cade, Caliban, and poor old
      Hodge? No, no, Nevil. Our clowns are the stupidest in Europe. They can&rsquo;t
      cook their meals. They can&rsquo;t spell; they can scarcely speak. They haven&rsquo;t
      a jig in their legs. And I believe they&rsquo;re losing their grin! They&rsquo;re
      nasty when their blood&rsquo;s up. Shakespeare&rsquo;s Cade tells you what he thought
      of Radicalizing the people. &ldquo;And as for your mother, I &lsquo;ll make her a
      duke&rdquo;; that &lsquo;s one of their songs. The word people, in England, is a
      dyspeptic agitator&rsquo;s dream when he falls nodding over the red chapter of
      French history. Who won the great liberties for England? My book says, the
      nobles. And who made the great stand later?&mdash;the squires. What have
      the middlemen done but bid for the people they despise and fear, dishonour
      us abroad and make a hash of us at home? Shrapnel sees that. Only he has
      got the word people in his mouth. The people of England, my dear fellow,
      want heading. Since the traders obtained power we have been a country on
      all fours. Of course Shrapnel sees it: I say so. But talk to him and teach
      him where to look for the rescue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett said to Stukely: &lsquo;If you have had a clear idea in what you
      have just spoken, my head&rsquo;s no place for it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Stukely&rsquo;s unusually lengthy observations had somewhat heated him, and he
      protested with earnestness: &lsquo;It was pure Tory, my dear colonel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the habitually and professedly cynical should not deliver themselves
      at length: for as soon as they miss their customary incision of speech
      they are apt to aim to recover it in loquacity, and thus it may be that
      the survey of their ideas becomes disordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Culbrett endangered his reputation for epigram in a good cause, it
      shall be said.
    </p>
    <p>
      These interruptions were torture to Beauchamp. Nevertheless the end was
      gained. He sank into a chair silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Romfrey wished to have it out with his nephew, of whose comic
      appearance as a man full of thunder, and occasionally rattling, yet all
      the while trying to be decorous and politic, he was getting tired. He
      foresaw that a tussle between them in private would possibly be too hot
      for his temper, admirably under control though it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not drag Cecil to Shrapnel?&rsquo; he said, for a provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp would not be goaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett remarked that he would have to leave Steynham the next
      day. His host remonstrated with him. The colonel said: &lsquo;Early.&rsquo; He had
      very particular business at home. He was positive, and declined every
      inducement to stay. Mr. Romfrey glanced at Nevil, thinking, You poor fool!
      And then he determined to let the fellow have five minutes alone with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This occurred at midnight, in that half-armoury, half-library, which was
      his private room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund heard their voices below. She cried out to herself that it was
      her doing, and blamed her beloved, and her master, and Dr. Shrapnel, in
      the breath of her self-recrimination. The demagogue, the over-punctilious
      gentleman, the faint lover, surely it must be reason wanting in the three
      for each of them in turn to lead the other, by an excess of some sort of
      the quality constituting their men&rsquo;s natures, to wreck a calm life and
      stand in contention! Had Shrapnel been commonly reasonable he would have
      apologized to Mr. Romfrey, or had Mr. Romfrey, he would not have resorted
      to force to punish the supposed offender, or had Nevil, he would have held
      his peace until he had gained his bride. As it was; the folly of the three
      knocked at her heart, uniting to bring the heavy accusation against one
      poor woman, quite in the old way: the Who is she? of the mocking Spaniard
      at mention of a social catastrophe. Rosamund had a great deal of the pride
      of her sex, and she resented any slur on it. She felt almost
      superciliously toward Mr. Romfrey and Nevil for their not taking hands to
      denounce the plotter, Cecil Baskelett. They seemed a pair of victims to
      him, nearly as much so as the wretched man Shrapnel. It was their
      senselessness which made her guilty! And simply because she had uttered
      two or three exclamations of dislike of a revolutionary and infidel she
      was compelled to groan under her present oppression! Is there anything to
      be hoped of men? Rosamund thought bitterly of Nevil&rsquo;s idea of their
      progress. Heaven help them! But the unhappy creatures have ceased to look
      to a heaven for help.
    </p>
    <p>
      We see the consequence of it in this Shrapnel complication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three men: and one struck down; the other defeated in his benevolent
      intentions; the third sacrificing fortune and happiness: all three owing
      their mischance to one or other of the vague ideas disturbing men&rsquo;s heads!
      Where shall we look for mother wit?&mdash;or say, common suckling&rsquo;s
      instinct? Not to men, thought Rosamund.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was listening to the voices of Mr. Romfrey and Beauchamp in a fever.
      Ordinarily the lord of Steynham was not out of his bed later than twelve
      o&rsquo;clock at night. His door opened at half-past one. Not a syllable was
      exchanged by the couple in the hall. They had fought it out. Mr. Romfrey
      came upstairs alone, and on the closing of his chamber-door she slipped
      down to Beauchamp and had a dreadful hour with him that subdued her
      disposition to sit in judgement upon men. The unavailing attempt to move
      his uncle had wrought him to the state in which passionate thoughts pass
      into speech like heat to flame. Rosamund strained her mental sight to gain
      a conception of his prodigious horror of the treatment of Dr. Shrapnel
      that she might think him sane: and to retain a vestige of comfort in her
      bosom she tried to moderate and make light of as much as she could
      conceive. Between the two efforts she had no sense but that of
      helplessness. Once more she was reduced to promise that she would speak
      the whole truth to Mr. Romfrey, even to the fact that she had experienced
      a common woman&rsquo;s jealousy of Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s influence, and had alluded to
      him jealously, spitefully, and falsely. There was no mercy in Beauchamp.
      He was for action at any cost, with all the forces he could gather, and
      without delays. He talked of Cecilia as his uncle&rsquo;s bride to him. Rosamund
      could hardly trust her ears when he informed her he had told his uncle of
      his determination to compel him to accomplish the act of penitence. &lsquo;Was
      it prudent to say it, Nevil?&rsquo; she asked. But, as in his politics, he
      disdained prudence. A monstrous crime had been committed, involving the
      honour of the family. No subtlety of insinuation, no suggestion, could
      wean him from the fixed idea that the apology to Dr. Shrapnel must be
      spoken by his uncle in person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If one could only imagine Mr. Romfrey doing it!&rsquo; Rosamund groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He shall: and you will help him,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you loved a woman half as much as you do that man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I knew a woman as good, as wise, as noble as he!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are losing her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You expect me to go through ceremonies of courtship at a time like this!
      If she cares for me she will feel with me. Simple compassion&mdash;but let
      Miss Halkett be. I&rsquo;m afraid I overtasked her in taking her to Bevisham.
      She remained outside the garden. Ma&rsquo;am, she is unsullied by contact with a
      single shrub of Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s territory.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not be so bitterly ironical, Nevil. You have not seen her as I have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund essayed a tender sketch of the fair young lady, and fancied that
      she drew forth a sigh; she would have coloured the sketch, but he
      commanded her to hurry off to bed, and think of her morning&rsquo;s work.
    </p>
    <p>
      A commission of which we feel we can accurately forecast the unsuccessful
      end is not likely to be undertaken with an ardour that might perhaps
      astound the presageing mind with unexpected issues. Rosamund fulfilled
      hers in the style of one who has learnt a lesson, and, exactly as she had
      anticipated, Mr. Romfrey accused her of coming to him from a conversation
      with that fellow Nevil overnight. He shrugged and left the house for his
      morning&rsquo;s walk across the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett and Cecilia beheld him from the breakfast-room returning
      with Beauchamp, who had waylaid him and was hammering his part in the now
      endless altercation. It could be descried at any distance; and how fine
      was Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s bearing!&mdash;truly noble by contrast, as of a grave
      big dog worried by a small barking dog. There is to an unsympathetic
      observer an intense vexatiousness in the exhibition of such pertinacity.
      To a soldier accustomed at a glance to estimate powers of attack and
      defence, this repeated puny assailing of a fortress that required years of
      siege was in addition ridiculous. Mr. Romfrey appeared impregnable, and
      Beauchamp mad. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s foaming again!&rsquo; said the colonel, and was only
      ultra-pictorial. &lsquo;Before breakfast!&rsquo; was a further slur on Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Romfrey was elevated by the extraordinary comicality of the notion of
      the proposed apology to heights of humour beyond laughter, whence we see
      the unbounded capacity of the general man for folly, and rather
      commiserate than deride him. He was quite untroubled. It demanded a steady
      view of the other side of the case to suppose of one whose control of his
      temper was perfect, that he could be in the wrong. He at least did not
      think so, and Colonel Halkett relied on his common sense. Beauchamp&rsquo;s
      brows were smouldering heavily, except when he had to talk. He looked
      paleish and worn, and said he had been up early. Cecilia guessed that he
      had not been to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dexterously contrived by her host, in spite of the colonel&rsquo;s
      manifest anxiety to keep them asunder, that she should have some minutes
      with Beauchamp out in the gardens. Mr. Romfrey led them out, and then led
      the colonel away to offer him a choice of pups of rare breed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil,&rsquo; said Cecilia, &lsquo;you will not think it presumption in me to give
      you advice?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her counsel to him was, that he should leave Steynham immediately, and
      trust to time for his uncle to reconsider his conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp urged the counter-argument of the stain on the family honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hinted at expediency; he frankly repudiated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The downs faced them, where the heavenly vast &lsquo;might have been&rsquo; of
      yesterday wandered thinner than a shadow of to-day; weaving a story
      without beginning, crisis, or conclusion, flowerless and fruitless, but
      with something of infinite in it sweeter to brood on than the future of
      her life to Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If meanwhile Dr. Shrapnel should die, and repentance comes too late!&rsquo; 
      said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no clear answer to that, save the hope of its being an unfounded
      apprehension. &lsquo;As far as it is in my power, Nevil, I will avoid injustice
      to him in my thoughts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at her thankfully. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s like sighting the
      cliffs. But I don&rsquo;t feel home round me while the colonel is so strangely
      prepossessed. For a high-spirited gentleman like your father to approve,
      or at least accept, an act so barbarous is incomprehensible. Speak to him,
      Cecilia, will you? Let him know your ideas.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She assented. He said instantly, &lsquo;Persuade him to speak to my uncle
      Everard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was tempted to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must do only what I think wise, if I am to be of service, Nevil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True, but paint that scene to him. An old man, utterly defenceless,
      making no defence! a cruel error. The colonel can&rsquo;t, or he doesn&rsquo;t,
      clearly get it inside him, otherwise I&rsquo;m certain it would revolt him: just
      as I am certain my uncle Everard is at this moment a stone-blind man. If
      he has done a thing, he can&rsquo;t question it, won&rsquo;t examine it. The thing
      becomes a part of him, as much as his hand or his head. He &lsquo;s a man of the
      twelfth century. Your father might be helped to understand him first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said, not very warmly, though sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell the colonel how it must have been brought about. For Cecil Baskelett
      called on Dr. Shrapnel two days before Mr. Romfrey stood at his gate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of Cecil caused her to draw in her shoulders in a half-shudder.
      &lsquo;It may indeed be Captain Baskelett who set this cruel thing in motion!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then point that out to your father, said he, perceiving a chance of
      winning her to his views through a concrete object of her dislike, and
      cooling toward the woman who betrayed a vulgar characteristic of her sex;
      who was merely woman, unable sternly to recognize the doing of a foul
      wrong because of her antipathy, until another antipathy enlightened her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted in fact a ready-made heroine, and did not give her credit for
      the absence of fire in her blood, as well as for the unexercised
      imagination which excludes young women from the power to realize unwonted
      circumstances. We men walking about the world have perhaps no more
      imagination of matters not domestic than they; but what we have is quick
      with experience: we see the thing we hear of: women come to it how they
      can.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was recommended to weave a narrative for her father, and
      ultimately induce him, if she could, to give a gentleman&rsquo;s opinion of the
      case to Mr. Romfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sensitive ear caught a change of tone in the directions she received.
      &lsquo;Your father will say so and so: answer him with this and that.&rsquo; Beauchamp
      supplied her with phrases. She was to renew and renew the attack; hammer
      as he did. Yesterday she had followed him: to-day she was to march beside
      him&mdash;hardly as an equal. Patience! was the word she would have
      uttered in her detection of the one frailty in his nature which this
      hurrying of her off her feet opened her eyes to with unusual perspicacity.
      Still she leaned to him sufficiently to admit that he had grounds for a
      deep disturbance of his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: &lsquo;I go to Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s cottage, and don&rsquo;t know how to hold up my
      head before Miss Denham. She confided him to me when she left for
      Switzerland!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was that to be thought of, certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett came round a box-bush and discovered them pacing together
      in a fashion to satisfy his paternal scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been calling you several times, my dear,&rsquo; he complained. &lsquo;We start
      in seven minutes. Bustle, and bonnet at once. Nevil, I&rsquo;m sorry for this
      business. Good-bye. Be a good boy, Nevil,&rsquo; he murmured kindheartedly, and
      shook Beauchamp&rsquo;s hand with the cordiality of an extreme relief in leaving
      him behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel and Mr. Romfrey and Beauchamp were standing on the hall-steps
      when Rosamund beckoned the latter and whispered a request for that letter
      of Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s. &lsquo;It is for Miss Halkett, Nevil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He plucked the famous epistle from his bulging pocketbook, and added a
      couple of others in the same handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell her, a first reading&mdash;it&rsquo;s difficult to read at first,&rsquo; he
      said, and burned to read it to Cecilia himself: to read it to her with his
      comments and explanations appeared imperative. It struck him in a flash
      that Cecilia&rsquo;s counsel to him to quit Steynham for awhile was good. And if
      he went to Bevisham he would be assured of Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s condition: notes
      and telegrams from the cottage were too much tempered to console and
      deceive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Send my portmanteau and bag after me to Bevisham,&rsquo; he said Rosamund, and
      announced to the woefully astonish colonel that he would have the pleasure
      of journeying in his company as far as the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you ready? No packing?&rsquo; said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s better to have your impediments in the rear of you, and march!&rsquo; said
      Mr. Romfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett declined to wait for anybody. He shouted for his daughter.
      The lady&rsquo;s maid appeared, and then Cecilia with Rosamund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t entertain you, Nevil; we&rsquo;re away to the island: I&rsquo;m sorry,&rsquo; said
      the colonel; and observing Cecilia&rsquo;s face in full crimson, he looked at
      her as if he had lost a battle by the turn of events at the final moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Romfrey handed Cecilia into the carriage. He exchanged a friendly
      squeeze with the colonel, and offered his hand to his nephew. Beauchamp
      passed him with a nod and &lsquo;Good-bye, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have ready at Holdesbury for the middle of the month,&rsquo; said Mr. Romfrey,
      unruffled, and bowed to Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you think of bringing my cousin Baskelett, give me warning, sir,&rsquo; 
      cried Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me warning, if you want the house for Shrapnel,&rsquo; replied his uncle,
      and remarked to Rosamund, as the carriage wheeled round the mounded
      laurels to the avenue, &lsquo;He mayn&rsquo;t be quite cracked. The fellow seems to
      have a turn for catching his opportunity by the tail. He had better hold
      fast, for it&rsquo;s his last.&rsquo;

      CHAPTER XXXVII. CECILIA CONQUERED
    </h2>
    <p>
      The carriage rolled out of the avenue and through the park, for some time
      parallel with the wavy downs. Once away from Steynham Colonel Halkett
      breathed freely, as if he had dropped a load: he was free of his bond to
      Mr. Romfrey, and so great was the sense of relief in him that he resolved
      to do battle against his daughter, supposing her still lively blush to be
      the sign of the enemy&rsquo;s flag run up on a surrendered citadel. His
      authority was now to be thought of: his paternal sanction was in his own
      keeping. Beautiful as she looked, it was hardly credible that a fellow in
      possession of his reason could have let slip his chance of such a prize;
      but whether he had or had not, the colonel felt that he occupied a
      position enabling him either to out-manoeuvre, or, if need were, interpose
      forcibly and punish him for his half-heartedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia looked the loveliest of women to Beauchamp&rsquo;s eyes, with her blush,
      and the letters of Dr. Shrapnel in her custody, at her express desire.
      Certain terms in the letters here and there, unsweet to ladies, began to
      trouble his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the way, colonel,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you had a letter of Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s read
      to you by Captain Baskelett.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Iniquitous rubbish!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With his comments on it, I dare say you thought it so. I won&rsquo;t speak of
      his right to make it public. He wanted to produce his impressions of it
      and me, and that is a matter between him and me. Dr. Shrapnel makes use of
      strong words now and then, but I undertake to produce a totally different
      impression on you by reading the letter myself&mdash;sparing you&rsquo; (he
      turned to Cecilia) &lsquo;a word or two, common enough to men who write in black
      earnest and have humour.&rsquo; He cited his old favourite, the black and bright
      lecturer on Heroes. &lsquo;You have read him, I know, Cecilia. Well, Dr.
      Shrapnel is another, who writes in his own style, not the leading-article
      style or modern pulpit stuff. He writes to rouse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He does that to my temper,&rsquo; said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps here and there he might offend Cecilia&rsquo;s taste,&rsquo; Beauchamp
      pursued for her behoof. &lsquo;Everything depends on the mouthpiece. I should
      not like the letter to be read without my being by;&mdash;except by men:
      any just-minded man may read it: Seymour Austin, for example. Every line
      is a text to the mind of the writer. Let me call on you to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow?&rsquo; Colonel Halkett put on a thoughtful air. &lsquo;To-morrow we&rsquo;re off
      to the island for a couple of days; and there&rsquo;s Lord Croyston&rsquo;s garden
      party, and the Yacht Ball. Come this evening-dine with us. No reading of
      letters, please. I can&rsquo;t stand it, Nevil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The invitation was necessarily declined by a gentleman who could not
      expect to be followed by supplies of clothes and linen for evening wear
      that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, we shall see you some day or other,&rsquo; said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was less alive to Beauchamp&rsquo;s endeavour to prepare her for the
      harsh words in the letter than to her father&rsquo;s insincerity. She would have
      asked her friend to come in the morning next day, but for the dread of
      deepening her blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you intend to start so early in the morning, papa?&rsquo; she ventured to
      say; and he replied, &lsquo;As early as possible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what news I shall have in Bevisham, or I would engage to run
      over to the island,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, with a flattering persistency or
      singular obtuseness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will dance,&rsquo; he subsequently observed to Cecilia, out of the heart of
      some reverie. He had been her admiring partner on the night before the
      drive from Itchincope into Bevisham, and perhaps thought of her graceful
      dancing at the Yacht Ball, and the contrast it would present to his watch
      beside a sick man-struck down by one of his own family.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could have answered, &lsquo;Not if you wish me not to&rsquo;; while smiling at the
      quaint sorrowfulness of his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dance!&rsquo; quoth Colonel Halkett, whose present temper discerned a healthy
      antagonism to misanthropic Radicals in the performance, &lsquo;all young people
      dance. Have you given over dancing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not entirely, colonel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia danced with Mr. Tuckham at the Yacht Ball, and was vividly mindful
      of every slight incident leading to and succeeding her lover&rsquo;s abrupt,
      &lsquo;You will dance&rsquo; which had all passed by her dream-like up to that hour
      his attempt to forewarn her of the phrases she would deem objectionable in
      Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s letter; his mild acceptation of her father&rsquo;s hostility; his
      adieu to her, and his melancholy departure on foot from the station, as
      she drove away to Mount Laurels and gaiety. Why do I dance? she asked
      herself. It was not in the spirit of happiness. Her heart was not with Dr.
      Shrapnel, but very near him, and heavy as a chamber of the sick. She was
      afraid of her father&rsquo;s favourite, imagining, from the colonel&rsquo;s
      unconcealed opposition to Beauchamp, that he had designs in the interests
      of Mr. Tuckham. But the hearty gentleman scattered her secret terrors by
      his bluffness and openness. He asked her to remember that she had
      recommended him to listen to Seymour Austin, and he had done so, he said.
      Undoubtedly he was much improved, much less overbearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He won her confidence by praising and loving her father, and when she
      alluded to the wonderful services he had rendered on the Welsh estate, he
      said simply that her father&rsquo;s thanks repaid him. He recalled his former
      downrightness only in speaking of the case of Dr. Shrapnel, upon which,
      both with the colonel and with her, he was unreservedly condemnatory of
      Mr. Romfrey. Colonel Halkett&rsquo;s defence of the true knight and guardian of
      the reputation of ladies, fell to pieces in the presence of Mr. Tuckham.
      He had seen Dr. Shrapnel, on a visit to Mr. Lydiard, whom he described as
      hanging about Bevisham, philandering as a married man should not, though
      in truth he might soon expect to be released by the death of his crazy
      wife. The doctor, he said, had been severely shaken by the monstrous
      assault made on him, and had been most unrighteously handled. The doctor
      was an inoffensive man in his private life, detestable and dangerous
      though his teachings were. Outside politics Mr. Tuckham went altogether
      with Beauchamp. He promised also that old Mrs. Beauchamp should be
      accurately informed of the state of matters between Captain Beauchamp and
      Mr. Romfrey. He left Mount Laurels to go back in attendance on the
      venerable lady, without once afflicting Cecilia with a shiver of
      well-founded apprehension, and she was grateful to him almost to friendly
      affection in the vanishing of her unjust suspicion, until her father
      hinted that there was the man of his heart. Then she closed all avenues to
      her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      A period of maidenly distress not previously unknown to her ensued.
      Proposals of marriage were addressed to her by two untitled gentlemen, and
      by the Earl of Lockrace: three within a fortnight. The recognition of the
      young heiress&rsquo;s beauty at the Yacht Ball was accountable for the bursting
      out of these fires. Her father would not have deplored her acceptance of
      the title of Countess of Lockrace. In the matter of rejections, however,
      her will was paramount, and he was on her side against relatives when the
      subject was debated among them. He called her attention to the fact
      impressively, telling her that she should not hear a syllable from him to
      persuade her to marry: the emphasis of which struck the unspoken warning
      on her intelligence: Bring no man to me of whom I do not approve!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Worthier of you, as I hope to become,&rsquo; Beauchamp had said. Cecilia lit on
      that part of Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s letter where &lsquo;Fight this out within you,&rsquo; 
      distinctly alluded to the unholy love. Could she think ill of the man who
      thus advised him? She shared Beauchamp&rsquo;s painful feeling for him in a
      sudden tremour of her frame; as it were through his touch. To the rest of
      the letter her judgement stood opposed, save when a sentence here and
      there reminded her of Captain Baskelett&rsquo;s insolent sing-song declamation
      of it: and that would have turned Sacred Writing to absurdity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp had mentioned Seymour Austin as one to whom he would willingly
      grant a perusal of the letter. Mr. Austin came to Mount Laurels about the
      close of the yachting season, shortly after Colonel Halkett had spent his
      customary days of September shooting at Steynham. Beauchamp&rsquo;s folly was
      the colonel&rsquo;s theme, for the fellow had dragged Lord Palmet there, and
      driven his uncle out of patience. Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s monumental patience had
      been exhausted by him. The colonel boiled over with accounts of
      Beauchamp&rsquo;s behaviour toward his uncle, and Palmet, and Baskelett, and
      Mrs. Culling: how he flew at and worried everybody who seemed to him to
      have had a hand in the proper chastisement of that man Shrapnel. That
      pestiferous letter of Shrapnel&rsquo;s was animadverted on, of course; and, &lsquo;I
      should like you to have heard it, Austin,&rsquo; the colonel said, &lsquo;just for you
      to have a notion of the kind of universal blow-up those men are scheming,
      and would hoist us with, if they could get a little more blasting-powder
      than they mill in their lunatic heads.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Cecilia wished for Mr. Austin&rsquo;s opinion of Dr. Shrapnel; and as the
      delicate state of her inclinations made her conscious that to give him the
      letter covertly would be to betray them to him, who had once, not knowing
      it, moved her to think of a possible great change in her life, she
      mustered courage to say, &lsquo;Captain Beauchamp at my request lent me the
      letter to read; I have it, and others written by Dr. Shrapnel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father hummed to himself, and immediately begged Seymour Austin not to
      waste his time on the stuff, though he had no idea that a perusal of it
      could awaken other than the gravest reprehension in so rational a Tory
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Austin read the letter through. He asked to see the other letters
      mentioned by Cecilia, and read them calmly, without a frown or an
      interjection. She sat sketching, her father devouring newspaper columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the writing of a man who means well,&rsquo; Mr. Austin delivered his
      opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, the man&rsquo;s an infidel!&rsquo; Colonel Halkett exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are numbers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They have the grace not to confess, then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s as well to know what the world&rsquo;s made of, colonel. The clergy shut
      their eyes. There&rsquo;s no treating a disease without reading it; and if we
      are to acknowledge a &ldquo;vice,&rdquo; as Dr. Shrapnel would say of the so-called
      middle-class, it is the smirking over what they think, or their not caring
      to think at all. Too many time-servers rot the State. I can understand the
      effect of such writing on a mind like Captain Beauchamp&rsquo;s. It would do no
      harm to our young men to have those letters read publicly and lectured
      on-by competent persons. Half the thinking world may think pretty much the
      same on some points as Dr. Shrapnel; they are too wise or too indolent to
      say it: and of the other half, about a dozen members would be competent to
      reply to him. He is the earnest man, and flies at politics as uneasy young
      brains fly to literature, fancying they can write because they can write
      with a pen. He perceives a bad adjustment of things: which is correct. He
      is honest, and takes his honesty for a virtue: and that entitles him to
      believe in himself: and that belief causes him to see in all opposition to
      him the wrong he has perceived in existing circumstances: and so in a
      dream of power he invokes the people: and as they do not stir, he takes to
      prophecy. This is the round of the politics of impatience. The study of
      politics should be guided by some light of statesmanship, otherwise it
      comes to this wild preaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      These men are theory-tailors, not politicians. They are the men who make
      the &ldquo;strait-waistcoat for humanity.&rdquo; They would fix us to first principles
      like tethered sheep or hobbled horses. I should enjoy replying to him, if
      I had time. The whole letter is composed of variations upon one idea.
      Still I must say the man interests me; I should like to talk to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Austin paid no heed to the colonel&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dear me! dear me!&rsquo; of amazement.
      He said of the style of the letters, that it was the puffing of a giant: a
      strong wind rather than speech: and begged Cecilia to note that men who
      labour to force their dreams on mankind and turn vapour into fact, usually
      adopt such a style. Hearing that this private letter had been deliberately
      read through by Mr. Romfrey, and handed by him to Captain Baskelett, who
      had read it out in various places, Mr. Austin said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A strange couple!&rsquo; He appeared perplexed by his old friend&rsquo;s approval of
      them. &lsquo;There we decidedly differ,&rsquo; said he, when the case of Dr. Shrapnel
      was related by the colonel, with a refusal to condemn Mr. Romfrey. He
      pronounced Mr. Romfrey&rsquo;s charges against Dr. Shrapnel, taken in
      conjunction with his conduct, to be baseless, childish, and wanton. The
      colonel would not see the case in that light; but Cecilia did. It was a
      justification of Beauchamp; and how could she ever have been blind to it?&mdash;scarcely
      blind, she remembered, but sensitively blinking her eyelids to distract
      her sight in contemplating it, and to preserve her repose. As to
      Beauchamp&rsquo;s demand of the apology, Mr. Austin considered that it might be
      an instance of his want of knowledge of men, yet could not be called
      silly, and to call it insane was the rhetoric of an adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do call it insane,&rsquo; said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He separated himself from his daughter by a sharp division.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Beauchamp appeared at Mount Laurels, Cecilia would have been ready to
      support and encourage him, boldly. Backed by Mr. Austin, she saw some good
      in Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s writing, much in Beauchamp&rsquo;s devotedness. He shone clear
      to her reason, at last: partly because her father in his opposition to him
      did not, but was on the contrary unreasonable, cased in mail, mentally
      clouded. She sat with Mr. Austin and her father, trying repeatedly, in
      obedience to Beauchamp&rsquo;s commands, to bring the latter to a just
      contemplation of the unhappy case; behaviour on her part which rendered
      the colonel inveterate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp at this moment was occupied in doing secretary&rsquo;s work for Dr.
      Shrapnel. So Cecilia learnt from Mr. Lydiard, who came to pay his respects
      to Mrs. Wardour-Devereux at Mount Laurels. The pursuit of the apology was
      continued in letters to his uncle and occasional interviews with him,
      which were by no means instigated by the doctor, Mr. Lydiard informed the
      ladies. He described Beauchamp as acting in the spirit of a man who has
      sworn an oath to abandon every pleasure in life, that he may, as far as it
      lies in his power, indemnify his friend for the wrong done to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Such men are too terrible for me,&rsquo; said Mrs. Devereux.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia thought the reverse: Not for me! But she felt a strain upon her
      nature, and she was miserable in her alienation from her father. Kissing
      him one night, she laid her head on his breast, and begged his
      forgiveness. He embraced her tenderly. &lsquo;Wait, only wait; you will see I am
      right,&rsquo; he said, and prudently said no more, and did not ask her to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was glad that she had sought the reconciliation from her heart&rsquo;s
      natural warmth, on hearing some time later that M. de Croisnel was dead,
      and that Beauchamp meditated starting for France to console his Renee. Her
      continual agitations made her doubtful of her human feelings: she clung to
      that instance of her filial stedfastness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day before Cecilia and her father left Mount Laurels for their season
      in Wales, Mr. Tuckham and Beauchamp came together to the house, and were
      closeted an hour with her father. Cecilia sat in the drawing-room,
      thinking that she did indeed wait, and had great patience. Beauchamp
      entered the room alone. He looked worn and thin, of a leaden colour, like
      the cloud that bears the bolt. News had reached him of the death of Lord
      Avonley in the hunting-field, and he was going on to Steynham to persuade
      his uncle to accompany him to Bevisham and wash the guilt of his
      wrong-doing off him before applying for the title. &lsquo;You would advise me
      not to go?&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I must. I should be dishonoured myself if I let a
      chance pass. I run the risk of being a beggar: I&rsquo;m all but one now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia faltered: &lsquo;Do you see a chance?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hardly more than an excuse for trying it,&rsquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him back Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s letters. &lsquo;I have read them,&rsquo; was all she
      said. For he might have just returned from France, with the breath of
      Renee about him, and her pride would not suffer her to melt him in rivalry
      by saying what she had been led to think of the letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing nothing from her, he silently put them in his pocket. The struggle
      with his uncle seemed to be souring him or deadening him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not alone for long. Mr. Tuckham presented himself to take his
      leave of her. Old Mrs. Beauchamp was dying, and he had only come to Mount
      Laurels on special business. Beauchamp was just as anxious to hurry away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father found her sitting in the solitude of a drawing-room at midday,
      pale-faced, with unoccupied fingers, not even a book in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked up and down the room until Cecilia, to say something, said: &lsquo;Mr.
      Tuckham could not stay.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said her father; &lsquo;he could not. He has to be back as quick as he can
      to cut his legacy in halves!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia looked perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll speak plainly,&rsquo; said the colonel. &lsquo;He sees that Nevil has ruined
      himself with his uncle. The old lady won&rsquo;t allow Nevil to visit her; in
      her condition it would be an excitement beyond her strength to bear. She
      sent Blackburn to bring Nevil here, and give him the option of stating
      before me whether those reports about his misconduct in France were true
      or not. He demurred at first: however, he says they are not true. He would
      have run away with the Frenchwoman, and he would have fought the duel: but
      he did neither. Her brother ran ahead of him and fought for him: so he
      declares and she wouldn&rsquo;t run. So the reports are false. We shall know
      what Blackburn makes of the story when we hear of the legacy. I have been
      obliged to write word to Mrs. Beauchamp that I believe Nevil to have made
      a true statement of the facts. But I distinctly say, and so I told
      Blackburn, I don&rsquo;t think money will do Nevil Beauchamp a farthing&rsquo;s worth
      of good. Blackburn follows his own counsel. He induced the old lady to
      send him; so I suppose he intends to let her share the money between them.
      I thought better of him; I thought him a wiser man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gratitude to Mr. Tuckham on Beauchamp&rsquo;s behalf caused Cecilia to praise
      him, in the tone of compliments. The difficulty of seriously admiring two
      gentlemen at once is a feminine dilemma, with the maidenly among women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has disappointed me,&rsquo; said Colonel Halkett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you have had him allow a falsehood to enrich him and ruin Nevil,
      papa?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear child, I&rsquo;m sick to death of romantic fellows. I took Blackburn
      for one of our solid young men. Why should he share his aunt&rsquo;s fortune?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean, why should Nevil have money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I do mean that. Besides, the story was not false as far as his
      intentions went: he confessed it, and I ought to have put it in a
      postscript. If Nevil wants money, let him learn to behave himself like a
      gentleman at Steynham.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has not failed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll say, then, behave himself, simply. He considers it a point of honour
      to get his uncle Everard to go down on his knees to Shrapnel. But he has
      no moral sense where I should like to see it: none: he confessed it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What were his words, papa?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t remember words. He runs over to France, whenever it suits him, to
      carry on there...&rsquo; The colonel ended in a hum and buzz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has he been to France lately?&rsquo; asked Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her breath hung for the answer, sedately though she sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The woman&rsquo;s father is dead, I hear,&rsquo; Colonel Halkett remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But he has not been there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can I tell? He&rsquo;s anywhere, wherever his passions whisk him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say, yes. And if he has money, we shall see him going sky-high and
      scattering it in sparks, not merely spending; I mean living immorally,
      infidelizing, republicanizing, scandalizing his class and his country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no!&rsquo; exclaimed Cecilia, rising and moving to the window to feast her
      eyes on driving clouds, in a strange exaltation of mind, secretly sure now
      that her idea of Nevil&rsquo;s having gone over to France was groundless; and
      feeling that she had been unworthy of him who strove to be &lsquo;worthier of
      her, as he hoped to become.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett scoffed at her &lsquo;Oh no,&rsquo; and called it woman&rsquo;s logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not restrain herself. &lsquo;Have you forgotten Mr. Austin, papa? It
      is Nevil&rsquo;s perfect truthfulness that makes him appear worse to you than
      men who are timeservers. Too many time-servers rot the State, Mr. Austin
      said. Nevil is not one of them. I am not able to judge or speculate
      whether he has a great brain or is likely to distinguish himself out of
      his profession: I would rather he did not abandon it: but Mr. Austin said
      to me in talking of him...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That notion of Austin&rsquo;s of screwing women&rsquo;s minds up to the pitch of
      men&rsquo;s!&rsquo; interjected the colonel with a despairing flap of his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He said, papa, that honestly active men in a country, who decline to
      practise hypocrisy, show that the blood runs, and are a sign of health.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You misunderstood him, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I thoroughly understood him. He did not call them wise. He said
      they might be dangerous if they were not met in debate. But he said, and I
      presume to think truly, that the reason why they are decried is, that it
      is too great a trouble for a lazy world to meet them. And, he said, the
      reason why the honest factions agitate is because they encounter sneers
      until they appear in force. If they were met earlier, and fairly&mdash;I
      am only quoting him&mdash;they would not, I think he said, or would
      hardly, or would not generally, fall into professional agitation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Austin&rsquo;s a speculative Tory, I know; and that&rsquo;s his weakness,&rsquo; observed
      the colonel. &lsquo;But I&rsquo;m certain you misunderstood him. He never would have
      called us a lazy people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not in matters of business: in matters of thought.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Cecilia! You&rsquo;ve got hold of a language!... a way of speaking!
      .... Who set you thinking on these things?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I owe to Nevil Beauchamp!
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett indulged in a turn or two up and down the room. He threw
      open a window, sniffed the moist air, and went to his daughter to speak to
      her resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Between a Radical and a Tory, I don&rsquo;t know where your head has been
      whirled to, my dear. Your heart seems to be gone: more sorrow for us! And
      for Nevil Beauchamp to be pretending to love you while carrying on with
      this Frenchwoman!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has never said that he loved me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The splendour of her beauty in humility flashed on her father, and he
      cried out: &lsquo;You are too good for any man on earth! We won&rsquo;t talk in the
      dark, my darling. You tell me he has never, as they say, made love to
      you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never, papa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, that proves the French story. At any rate, he &lsquo;s a man of honour.
      But you love him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The French story is untrue, papa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia stood in a blush like the burning cloud of the sunset.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me frankly: I&rsquo;m your father, your old dada, your friend, my dear
      girl! do you think the man cares for you, loves you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied: &lsquo;I know, papa, the French story is untrue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But when I tell you, silly woman, he confessed it to me out of his own
      mouth!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not true now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not going on, you mean? How do you know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has he been swearing it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has not spoken of it to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here I am in a woman&rsquo;s web!&rsquo; cried the colonel. &lsquo;Is it your instinct
      tells you it&rsquo;s not true? or what? what? You have not denied that you love
      the man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know he is not immoral.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There you shoot again! Haven&rsquo;t you a yes or a no for your father?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia cast her arms round his neck, and sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not bring it to her lips to say (she would have shunned the
      hearing) that her defence of Beauchamp, which was a shadowed avowal of the
      state of her heart, was based on his desire to read to her the conclusion
      of Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s letter touching a passion to be overcome; necessarily
      therefore a passion that was vanquished, and the fullest and bravest
      explanation of his shifting treatment of her: nor would she condescend to
      urge that her lover would have said he loved her when they were at
      Steynham, but for the misery and despair of a soul too noble to be
      diverted from his grief and sense of duty, and, as she believed, unwilling
      to speak to win her while his material fortune was in jeopardy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel cherished her on his breast, with one hand regularly patting
      her shoulder: a form of consolation that cures the disposition to sob as
      quickly as would the drip of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia looked up into his eyes, and said, &lsquo;We will not be parted, papa,
      ever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel said absently: &lsquo;No&rsquo;; and, surprised at himself, added: &lsquo;No,
      certainly not. How can we be parted? You won&rsquo;t run away from me? No, you
      know too well I can&rsquo;t resist you. I appeal to your judgement, and I must
      accept what you decide. But he is immoral. I repeat that. He has no roots.
      We shall discover it before it&rsquo;s too late, I hope.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia gazed away, breathing through tremulous dilating nostrils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One night after dinner at Steynham,&rsquo; pursued the colonel, &lsquo;Nevil was
      rattling against the Press, with Stukely Culbrett to prime him: and he
      said editors of papers were growing to be like priests, and as timid as
      priests, and arrogant: and for one thing, it was because they supposed
      themselves to be guardians of the national morality. I forget exactly what
      the matter was: but he sneered at priests and morality.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile wove round Cecilia&rsquo;s lips, and in her towering superiority to one
      who talked nonsense, she slipped out of maiden shame and said: &lsquo;Attack
      Nevil for his political heresies and his wrath with the Press for not
      printing him. The rest concerns his honour, where he is quite safe, and
      all are who trust him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you find out you&rsquo;re wrong?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if you find out you&rsquo;re wrong about him,&rsquo; her father reiterated
      piteously, &lsquo;you won&rsquo;t tear me to strips to have him in spite of it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, papa, not I. I will not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s something for me to hold fast to,&rsquo; said Colonel Halkett,
      sighing.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII. LORD AVONLEY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Everard Romfrey was now, by consent, Lord Avonley, mounted on his
      direct heirship and riding hard at the earldom. His elevation occurred at
      a period of life that would have been a season of decay with most men; but
      the prolonged and lusty Autumn of the veteran took new fires from a
      tangible object to live for. His brother Craven&rsquo;s death had slightly
      stupefied, and it had grieved him: it seemed to him peculiarly pathetic;
      for as he never calculated on the happening of mortal accidents to men of
      sound constitution, the circumstance imparted a curious shake to his own
      solidity. It was like the quaking of earth, which tries the balance of the
      strongest. If he had not been raised to so splendid a survey of the actual
      world, he might have been led to think of the imaginary, where perchance a
      man may meet his old dogs and a few other favourites, in a dim perpetual
      twilight. Thither at all events Craven had gone, and goodnight to him! The
      earl was a rapidly lapsing invalid. There could be no doubt that Everard
      was to be the head of his House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outwardly he was the same tolerant gentleman who put aside the poor fools
      of the world to walk undisturbed by them in the paths he had chosen: in
      this aspect he knew himself: nor was the change so great within him as to
      make him cognizant of a change. It was only a secret turn in the bent of
      the mind, imperceptible as the touch of the cunning artist&rsquo;s brush on a
      finished portrait, which will alter the expression without discomposing a
      feature, so that you cannot say it is another face, yet it is not the
      former one. His habits were invariable, as were his meditations. He
      thought less of Romfrey Castle than of his dogs and his devices for
      trapping vermin; his interest in birds and beasts and herbs, &lsquo;what ninnies
      call Nature in books,&rsquo; to quote him, was undiminished; imagination he had
      none to clap wings to his head and be off with it. He betrayed as little
      as he felt that the coming Earl of Romfrey was different from the cadet of
      the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      A novel sharpness in the &lsquo;Stop that,&rsquo; with which he crushed Beauchamp&rsquo;s
      affectedly gentle and unusually roundabout opening of the vexed Shrapnel
      question, rang like a shot in the room at Steynham, and breathed a
      different spirit from his customary easy pugnacity that welcomed and lured
      on an adversary to wild outhitting. Some sorrowful preoccupation is,
      however, to be expected in the man who has lost a brother, and some degree
      of irritability at the intrusion of past disputes. He chose to repeat a
      similar brief forbidding of the subject before they started together for
      the scene of the accident and Romfrey Castle. No notice was taken of
      Beauchamp&rsquo;s remark, that he consented to go though his duty lay elsewhere.
      Beauchamp had not the faculty of reading inside men, or he would have
      apprehended that his uncle was engaged in silently heaping aggravations to
      shoot forth one fine day a thundering and astonishing counterstroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      He should have known his uncle Everard better.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this respect he seemed to have no memory. But who has much that has
      given up his brains for a lodging to a single idea? It is at once a
      devouring dragon, and an intractable steamforce; it is a tyrant that has
      eaten up a senate, and a prophet with a message. Inspired of solitariness
      and gigantic size, it claims divine origin. The world can have no peace
      for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia had not pleased him; none had. He did not bear in mind that the
      sight of Dr. Shrapnel sick and weak, which constantly reanimated his
      feelings of pity and of wrath, was not given to the others of whom he
      demanded a corresponding energy of just indignation and sympathy. The
      sense that he was left unaided to the task of bending his tough uncle,
      combined with his appreciation of the righteousness of the task to
      embitter him and set him on a pedestal, from which he descended at every
      sign of an opportunity for striking, and to which he retired continually
      baffled and wrathful, in isolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then ensued the dreadful division in his conception of his powers: for he
      who alone saw the just and right thing to do, was incapable of compelling
      it to be done. Lay on to his uncle as he would, that wrestler shook him
      off. And here was one man whom he could not move! How move a nation?
    </p>
    <p>
      There came on him a thirst for the haranguing of crowds. They agree with
      you or they disagree; exciting you to activity in either case. They do not
      interpose cold Tory exclusiveness and inaccessibility. You have them in
      the rough; you have nature in them, and all that is hopeful in nature. You
      drive at, over, and through them, for their good; you plough them. You sow
      them too. Some of them perceive that it is for their good, and what if
      they be a minority? Ghastly as a minority is in an Election, in a lifelong
      struggle it is refreshing and encouraging. The young world and its triumph
      is with the minority. Oh to be speaking! Condemned to silence beside his
      uncle, Beauchamp chafed for a loosed tongue and an audience tossing like
      the well-whipped ocean, or open as the smooth sea-surface to the marks of
      the breeze. Let them be hostile or amicable, he wanted an audience as
      hotly as the humped Richard a horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Romfrey Castle he fell upon an audience that became transformed into a
      swarm of chatterers, advisers, and reprovers the instant his lips were
      parted. The ladies of the family declared his pursuit of the Apology to be
      worse and vainer than his politics. The gentlemen said the same, but they
      were not so outspoken to him personally, and indulged in asides, with
      quotations of some of his uncle Everard&rsquo;s recent observations concerning
      him: as for example, &lsquo;Politically he&rsquo;s a mad harlequin jumping his tights
      and spangles when nobody asks him to jump; and in private life he&rsquo;s a mad
      dentist poking his tongs at my sound tooth:&rsquo; a highly ludicrous image of
      the persistent fellow, and a reminder of situations in Moliere, as it was
      acted by Cecil Baskelett and Lord Welshpool. Beauchamp had to a certain
      extent restored himself to favour with his uncle Everard by offering a
      fair suggestion on the fatal field to account for the accident, after the
      latter had taken measurements and examined the place in perplexity. His
      elucidation of the puzzle was referred to by Lord Avonley at Romfrey, and
      finally accepted as possible and this from a wiseacre who went quacking
      about the county, expecting to upset the order of things in England! Such
      a mixing of sense and nonsense in a fellow&rsquo;s noddle was never before met
      with, Lord Avonley said. Cecil took the hint. He had been unworried by
      Beauchamp: Dr. Shrapnel had not been mentioned: and it delighted Cecil to
      let it be known that he thought old Nevil had some good notions,
      particularly as to the duties of the aristocracy&mdash;that first war-cry
      of his when a midshipman. News of another fatal accident in the
      hunting-field confirmed Cecil&rsquo;s higher opinion of his cousin. On the day
      of Craven&rsquo;s funeral they heard at Romfrey that Mr. Wardour-Devereux had
      been killed by a fall from his horse. Two English gentlemen despatched by
      the same agency within a fortnight! &lsquo;He smoked,&rsquo; Lord Avonley said of the
      second departure, to allay some perturbation in the bosoms of the ladies
      who had ceased to ride, by accounting for this particular mishap in the
      most reassuring fashion. Cecil&rsquo;s immediate reflection was that the
      unfortunate smoker had left a rich widow. Far behind in the race for Miss
      Halkett, and uncertain of a settled advantage in his other rivalry with
      Beauchamp, he fixed his mind on the widow, and as Beauchamp did not stand
      in his way, but on the contrary might help him&mdash;for she, like the
      generality of women, admired Nevil Beauchamp in spite of her feminine good
      sense and conservatism&mdash;Cecil began to regard the man he felt less
      opposed to with some recognition of his merits. The two nephews
      accompanied Lord Avonley to London, and slept at his town-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      They breakfasted together the next morning on friendly terms. Half an hour
      afterward there was an explosion; uncle and nephews were scattered
      fragments: and if Cecil was the first to return to cohesion with his lord
      and chief, it was, he protested energetically, common policy in a man in
      his position to do so: all that he looked for being a decent pension and a
      share in the use of the town-house. Old Nevil, he related, began
      cross-examining him and entangling him with the cunning of the deuce, in
      my lord&rsquo;s presence, and having got him to make an admission, old Nevil
      flung it at the baron, and even crossed him and stood before him when he
      was walking out of the room. A furious wrangle took place. Nevil and the
      baron gave it to one another unmercifully. The end of it was that all
      three flew apart, for Cecil confessed to having a temper, and in contempt
      of him for the admission wrung out of him, Lord Avonley had pricked it. My
      lord went down to Steynham, Beauchamp to Holdesbury, and Captain Baskelett
      to his quarters; whence in a few days he repaired penitently to my lord&mdash;the
      most placable of men when a full submission was offered to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp did nothing of the kind. He wrote a letter to Steynham in the
      form of an ultimatum.
    </p>
    <p>
      This egregious letter was handed to Rosamund for a proof of her darling&rsquo;s
      lunacy. She in conversation with Stukely Culbrett unhesitatingly accused
      Cecil of plotting his cousin&rsquo;s ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Culbrett thought it possible that Cecil had been a little more than
      humorous in the part he had played in the dispute, and spoke to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it came out that Lord Avonley had also delivered an ultimatum to
      Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time enough had gone by for Cecil to forget his ruffling, and relish the
      baron&rsquo;s grandly comic spirit in appropriating that big word Apology, and
      demanding it from Beauchamp on behalf of the lady ruling his household.
      What could be funnier than the knocking of Beauchamp&rsquo;s blunderbuss out of
      his hands, and pointing the muzzle at him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecil dramatized the fun to amuse Mr. Culbrett. Apparently Beauchamp had
      been staggered on hearing himself asked for the definite article he
      claimed. He had made a point of speaking of the Apology. Lord Avonley did
      likewise. And each professed to exact it for a deeply aggrieved person:
      each put it on the ground that it involved the other&rsquo;s rightful ownership
      of the title of gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;An apology to the amiable and virtuous Mistress Culling?&rdquo; says old
      Nevil: &ldquo;an apology? what for?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;For unbecoming and insolent
      behaviour,&rdquo; says my lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am that lady&rsquo;s friend,&rsquo; Stukely warned Captain Baskelett. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let us
      have a third apology in the field.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perfectly true; you are her friend, and you know what a friend of mine
      she is,&rsquo; rejoined Cecil. &lsquo;I could swear &ldquo;that lady&rdquo; flings the whole
      affair at me. I give you my word, old Nevil and I were on a capital
      footing before he and the baron broke up. I praised him for tickling the
      aristocracy. I backed him heartily; I do now; I&rsquo;ll do it in Parliament. I
      know a case of a noble lord, a General in the army, and he received an
      intimation that he might as well attend the Prussian cavalry manoeuvres
      last Autumn on the Lower Rhine or in Silesia&mdash;no matter where. He
      couldn&rsquo;t go: he was engaged to shoot birds! I give you my word. Now there
      I see old Nevil &lsquo;s right. It &lsquo;s as well we should know something about the
      Prussian and Austrian cavalry, and if our aristocracy won&rsquo;t go abroad to
      study cavalry, who is to? no class in the kingdom understands horses as
      they do. My opinion is, they&rsquo;re asleep. Nevil should have stuck to that,
      instead of trying to galvanize the country and turning against his class.
      But fancy old Nevil asked for the Apology! It petrified him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told
      her nothing but the truth,&rdquo; says Nevil. &ldquo;Telling the truth to women is an
      impertinence,&rdquo; says my lord. Nevil swore he&rsquo;d have a revolution in the
      country before he apologized.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Culbrett smiled at the absurdity of the change of positions between
      Beauchamp and his uncle Everard, which reminded him somewhat of the old
      story of the highwayman innkeeper and the market farmer who had been
      thoughtful enough to recharge his pistols after quitting the inn at
      midnight. A practical &lsquo;tu quoque&rsquo; is astonishingly laughable, and backed
      by a high figure and manner it had the flavour of triumphant repartee.
      Lord Avonley did not speak of it as a retort upon Nevil, though he
      reiterated the word Apology amusingly. He put it as due to the lady
      governing his household; and his ultimatum was, that the Apology should be
      delivered in terms to satisfy him within three months of the date of the
      demand for it: otherwise blank; but the shadowy index pointed to the
      destitution of Nevil Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      No stroke of retributive misfortune could have been severer to Rosamund
      than to be thrust forward as the object of humiliation for the man she
      loved. She saw at a glance how much more likely it was (remote as the
      possibility appeared) that her lord would perform the act of penitence
      than her beloved Nevil. And she had no occasion to ask herself why. Lord
      Avonley had done wrong, and Nevil had not. It was inconceivable that Nevil
      should apologize to her. It was horrible to picture the act in her mind.
      She was a very rational woman, quite a woman of the world, yet such was
      her situation between these two men that the childish tale of a close and
      consecutive punishment for sins, down to our little naughtinesses and
      naturalnesses, enslaved her intelligence, and amazed her with the example
      made of her, as it were to prove the tale true of our being surely hauled
      back like domestic animals learning the habits of good society, to the
      rueful contemplation of certain of our deeds, however wildly we appeal to
      nature to stand up for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But is it so with all of us? No, thought Rosamund, sinking dejectedly from
      a recognition of the heavenliness of the justice which lashed her and
      Nevil, and did not scourge Cecil Baskelett. That fine eye for celestially
      directed consequences is ever haunted by shadows of unfaith likely to
      obscure it completely when chastisement is not seen to fall on the person
      whose wickedness is evident to us. It has been established that we do not
      wax diviner by dragging down the Gods to our level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund knew Lord Avonley too well to harass him with further petitions
      and explanations. Equally vain was it to attempt to persuade Beauchamp. He
      made use of the house in London, where he met his uncle occasionally, and
      he called at Steynham for money, that he could have obtained upon the one
      condition, which was no sooner mentioned than fiery words flew in the
      room, and the two separated. The leaden look in Beauchamp, noticed by
      Cecilia Halkett in their latest interview, was deepening, and was of
      itself a displeasure to Lord Avonley, who liked flourishing faces, and
      said: &lsquo;That fellow&rsquo;s getting the look of a sweating smith&rsquo;: presumptively
      in the act of heating his poker at the furnace to stir the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      It now became an offence to him that Beauchamp should continue doing this
      in the speeches and lectures he was reported to be delivering; he stamped
      his foot at the sight of his nephew&rsquo;s name in the daily journals; a novel
      sentiment of social indignation was expressed by his crying out, at the
      next request for money: &lsquo;Money to prime you to turn the country into a
      rat-hole? Not a square inch of Pennsylvanian paper-bonds! What right have
      you to be lecturing and orationing? You&rsquo;ve no knowledge. All you&rsquo;ve got is
      your instincts, and that you show in your readiness to exhibit them like a
      monkey. You ought to be turned inside out on your own stage. You&rsquo;ve lumped
      your brains on a point or two about Land, and Commonland, and the
      Suffrage, and you pound away upon them, as if you had the key of the
      difficulty. It&rsquo;s the Scotchman&rsquo;s metaphysics; you know nothing clear, and
      your working-classes know nothing at all; and you blow them with wind like
      an over-stuffed cow. What you&rsquo;re driving at is to get hob-nail boots to
      dance on our heads. Stukely says you should be off over to Ireland. There
      you&rsquo;d swim in your element, and have speechifying from instinct, and
      howling and pummelling too, enough to last you out. I &lsquo;ll hand you money
      for that expedition. You&rsquo;re one above the number wanted here. You&rsquo;ve a
      look of bad powder fit only to flash in the pan. I saved you from the post
      of public donkey, by keeping you out of Parliament. You&rsquo;re braying and
      kicking your worst for it still at these meetings of yours. A naval
      officer preaching about Republicanism and parcelling out the Land!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp replied quietly, &lsquo;The lectures I read are Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s. When I
      speak I have his knowledge to back my deficiencies. He is too ill to work,
      and I consider it my duty to do as much of his work as I can undertake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! You&rsquo;re the old infidel&rsquo;s Amen clerk. It would rather astonish
      orthodox congregations to see clerks in our churches getting into the
      pulpit to read the sermon for sick clergymen,&rsquo; said Lord Avonley. His
      countenance furrowed. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll pay that bill,&rsquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pay down half a million!&rsquo; thundered Beauchamp; and dropping his voice,
      &lsquo;or go to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You remind me,&rsquo; his uncle observed. &lsquo;I recommend you to ring that bell,
      and have Mrs. Culling here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If she comes she will hear what I think of her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, out of the house!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, sir. You decline to supply me with money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must have it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say. Money&rsquo;s a chain-cable for holding men to their senses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ask you, my lord, how I am to carry on Holdesbury?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give it up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall have to,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, striving to be prudent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There isn&rsquo;t a doubt of it,&rsquo; said his uncle, upon a series of nods
      diminishing in their depth until his head assumed a droll interrogative
      fixity, with an air of &lsquo;What next?&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX. BETWEEN BEAUCHAMP AND CECILIA
    </h2>
    <p>
      Beauchamp quitted the house without answering as to what next, and without
      seeing Rosamund.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the matter of money, as of his physical health, he wanted to do too
      much at once; he had spent largely of both in his efforts to repair the
      injury done to Dr. Shrapnel. He was overworked, anxious, restless, craving
      for a holiday somewhere in France, possibly; he was all but leaping on
      board the boat at times, and, unwilling to leave his dear old friend who
      clung to him, he stayed, keeping his impulses below the tide-mark which
      leads to action, but where they do not yield peace of spirit. The tone of
      Renee&rsquo;s letters filled him with misgivings. She wrote word that she had
      seen M. d&rsquo;Henriel for the first time since his return from Italy, and he
      was much changed, and inclined to thank Roland for the lesson he had
      received from him at the sword&rsquo;s point. And next she urged Beauchamp to
      marry, so that he and she might meet, as if she felt a necessity for it.
      &lsquo;I shall love your wife; teach her to think amiably of me,&rsquo; she said. And
      her letter contained womanly sympathy for him in his battle with his
      uncle. Beauchamp thought of his experiences of Cecilia&rsquo;s comparative
      coldness. He replied that there was no prospect of his marrying; he wished
      there were one of meeting! He forbore from writing too fervently, but he
      alluded to happy days in Normandy, and proposed to renew them if she would
      say she had need of him. He entreated her to deal with him frankly; he
      reminded her that she must constantly look to him, as she had vowed she
      would, when in any kind of trouble; and he declared to her that he was
      unchanged. He meant, of an unchanged disposition to shield and serve her;
      but the review of her situation, and his knowledge of her quick blood,
      wrought him to some jealous lover&rsquo;s throbs, which led him to impress his
      unchangeableness upon her, to bind her to that standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      She declined his visit: not now; &lsquo;not yet&rsquo;: and for that he presumed to
      chide her, half-sincerely. As far as he knew he stood against everybody
      save his old friend and Renee; and she certainly would have refreshed his
      heart for a day. In writing, however, he had an ominous vision of the
      morrow to the day; and, both for her sake and his own, he was not
      unrejoiced to hear that she was engaged day and night in nursing her
      husband. Pursuing his vision of the morrow of an unreproachful day with
      Renee, the madness of taking her to himself, should she surrender at last
      to a third persuasion, struck him sharply, now that he and his uncle were
      foot to foot in downright conflict, and money was the question. He had not
      much remaining of his inheritance&mdash;about fifteen hundred pounds. He
      would have to vacate Holdesbury and his uncle&rsquo;s town-house in a month. Let
      his passion be never so desperate, for a beggared man to think of running
      away with a wife, or of marrying one, the folly is as big as the worldly
      offence: no justification is to be imagined. Nay, and there is no
      justification for the breach of a moral law. Beauchamp owned it, and felt
      that Renee&rsquo;s resistance to him in Normandy placed her above him. He
      remembered a saying of his moralist: &lsquo;We who interpret things heavenly by
      things earthly must not hope to juggle with them for our pleasures, and
      can look to no absolution of evil acts.&rsquo; The school was a hard one. It
      denied him holidays; it cut him off from dreams. It ran him in heavy
      harness on a rough highroad, allowing no turnings to right or left, no
      wayside croppings; with the simple permission to him that he should daily
      get thoroughly tired. And what was it Jenny Denham had said on the
      election day? &lsquo;Does incessant battling keep the intellect clear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind was clear enough to put the case, that either he beheld a
      tremendous magnification of things, or else that other men did not attach
      common importance to them; and he decided that the latter was the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      An incessant struggle of one man with the world, which position usually
      ranks his relatives against him, does not conduce to soundness of
      judgement. He may nevertheless be right in considering that he is right in
      the main. The world in motion is not so wise that it can pretend to
      silence the outcry of an ordinarily generous heart even&mdash;the very
      infant of antagonism to its methods and establishments. It is not so
      difficult to be right against the world when the heart is really active;
      but the world is our book of humanity, and before insisting that his
      handwriting shall occupy the next blank page of it, the noble rebel is
      bound for the sake of his aim to ask himself how much of a giant he is,
      lest he fall like a blot on the page, instead of inscribing intelligible
      characters there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, his relatives are present to assure him that he did not jump out
      of Jupiter&rsquo;s head or come of the doctor. They hang on him like an
      ill-conditioned prickly garment; and if he complains of the irritation
      they cause him, they one and all denounce his irritable skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fretted by his relatives he cannot be much of a giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp looked from Dr. Shrapnel in his invalid&rsquo;s chair to his uncle
      Everard breathing robustly, and mixed his uncle&rsquo;s errors with those of the
      world which honoured and upheld him. His remainder of equability departed;
      his impatience increased. His appetite for work at Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s
      writing-desk was voracious. He was ready for any labour, the transcribing
      of papers, writing from dictation, whatsoever was of service to Lord
      Avonley&rsquo;s victim: and he was not like the Spartan boy with the wolf at his
      vitals; he betrayed it in the hue his uncle Everard detested, in a visible
      nervousness, and indulgence in fits of scorn. Sharp epigrams and notes of
      irony provoked his laughter more than fun. He seemed to acquiesce in some
      of the current contemporary despair of our immoveable England, though he
      winced at a satire on his country, and attempted to show that the dull
      dominant class of moneymakers was the ruin of her. Wherever he stood to
      represent Dr. Shrapnel, as against Mr. Grancey Lespel on account of the
      Itchincope encroachments, he left a sting that spread the rumour of his
      having become not only a black torch of Radicalism&mdash;our modern
      provincial estateholders and their wives bestow that reputation lightly&mdash;but
      a gentleman with the polish scratched off him in parts. And he, though
      individually he did not understand how there was to be game in the land if
      game-preserving was abolished, signed his name R. C. S. NEVIL BEAUCHAMP
      for Dr. SHRAPNEL, in the communications directed to solicitors of the
      persecutors of poachers.
    </p>
    <p>
      His behaviour to Grancey Lespel was eclipsed by his treatment of Captain
      Baskelett. Cecil had ample reason to suppose his cousin to be friendly
      with him. He himself had forgotten Dr. Shrapnel, and all other
      dissensions, in a supremely Christian spirit. He paid his cousin the
      compliment to think that he had done likewise. At Romfrey and in London he
      had spoken to Nevil of his designs upon the widow: Nevil said nothing
      against it and it was under Mrs. Wardour-Devereux&rsquo;s eyes, and before a man
      named Lydiard, that, never calling to him to put him on his guard, Nevil
      fell foul of him with every capital charge that can be brought against a
      gentleman, and did so abuse, worry, and disgrace him as to reduce him to
      quit the house to avoid the scandal of a resort to a gentleman&rsquo;s last
      appeal in vindication of his character. Mrs. Devereux spoke of the
      terrible scene to Cecilia, and Lydiard to Miss Denham. The injured person
      communicated it to Lord Avonley, who told Colonel Halkett emphatically
      that his nephew Cecil deserved well of him in having kept command of his
      temper out of consideration for the family. There was a general murmur of
      the family over this incident. The widow was rich, and it ranked among the
      unwritten crimes against blood for one offshoot of a great house wantonly
      to thwart another in the wooing of her by humbling him in her presence,
      doing his utmost to expose him as a schemer, a culprit, and a poltroon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could it be that Beauchamp had reserved his wrath with his cousin to
      avenge Dr. Shrapnel upon him signally? Miss Denham feared her guardian was
      the cause. Lydiard was indefinitely of her opinion. The idea struck
      Cecilia Halkett, and as an example of Beauchamp&rsquo;s tenacity of purpose and
      sureness of aim it fascinated her. But Mrs. Wardour-Devereux did not
      appear to share it. She objected to Beauchamp&rsquo;s intemperateness and
      unsparingness, as if she was for conveying a sisterly warning to Cecilia;
      and that being off her mind, she added, smiling a little and colouring a
      little: &lsquo;We learn only from men what men are.&rsquo; How the scene commenced and
      whether it was provoked, she failed to recollect. She described Beauchamp
      as very self-contained in manner throughout his tongue was the scorpion.
      Cecilia fancied he must have resembled his uncle Everard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was conquered, but unclaimed. While supporting and approving him
      in her heart she was dreading to receive some new problem of his conduct;
      and still while she blamed him for not seeking an interview with her, she
      liked him for this instance of delicacy in the present state of his
      relations with Lord Avonley.
    </p>
    <p>
      A problem of her own conduct disturbed the young lady&rsquo;s clear conception
      of herself: and this was a ruffling of unfaithfulness in her love of
      Beauchamp, that was betrayed to her by her forgetfulness of him whenever
      she chanced to be with Seymour Austin. In Mr. Austin&rsquo;s company she
      recovered her forfeited repose, her poetry of life, her image of the
      independent Cecilia throned above our dust of battle, gazing on broad
      heaven. She carried the feeling so far that Blackburn Tuckham&rsquo;s enthusiasm
      for Mr. Austin gave him grace in her sight, and praise of her father&rsquo;s
      favourite from Mr. Austin&rsquo;s mouth made him welcome to her. The image of
      that grave capable head, dusty-grey about the temples, and the darkly
      sanguine face of the tried man, which was that of a seasoned warrior and
      inspired full trust in him, with his vivid look, his personal distinction,
      his plain devotion to the country&rsquo;s business, and the domestic solitude he
      lived in, admired, esteemed, loved perhaps, but unpartnered, was often her
      refuge and haven from tempestuous Beauchamp. She could see in vision the
      pride of Seymour Austin&rsquo;s mate. It flushed her reflectively. Conquered but
      not claimed, Cecilia was like the frozen earth insensibly moving round to
      sunshine in nature, with one white flower in her breast as innocent a sign
      of strong sweet blood as a woman may wear. She ascribed to that fair mate
      of Seymour Austin&rsquo;s many lofty charms of womanhood; above all,
      stateliness: her especial dream of an attainable superlative beauty in
      women. And supposing that lady to be accused of the fickle breaking of
      another love, who walked beside him, matched with his calm heart and one
      with him in counsel, would the accusation be repeated by them that beheld
      her husband? might it not rather be said that she had not deviated, but
      had only stepped higher? She chose no youth, no glistener, no idler: it
      was her soul striving upward to air like a seed in the earth that raised
      her to him: and she could say to the man once enchaining her: Friend, by
      the good you taught me I was led to this!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia&rsquo;s reveries fled like columns of mist before the gale when tidings
      reached her of a positive rupture between Lord Avonley and Nevil
      Beauchamp, and of the mandate to him to quit possession of Holdesbury and
      the London house within a certain number of days, because of his refusal
      to utter an apology to Mrs. Culling. Angrily on his behalf she prepared to
      humble herself to him. Louise Wardour-Devereux brought them to a meeting,
      at which Cecilia, with her heart in her hand, was icy. Mr. Lydiard,
      prompted by Mrs. Devereux, gave him better reasons for her singular
      coldness than Cecilia could give to herself, and some time afterward
      Beauchamp went to Mount Laurels, where Colonel Halkett mounted guard over
      his daughter, and behaved, to her thinking, cruelly. &lsquo;Now you have ruined
      yourself there&rsquo;s nothing ahead for you but to go to the Admiralty and
      apply for a ship,&rsquo; he said, sugaring the unkindness with the remark that
      the country would be the gainer. He let fly a side-shot at London men
      calling themselves military men who sought to repair their fortunes by
      chasing wealthy widows, and complimented Beauchamp: &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not one of
      that sort.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia looked at Beauchamp stedfastly. &lsquo;Speak,&rsquo; said the look.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he, though not blind, was keenly wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Money I must have,&rsquo; he said, half to the colonel, half to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett shrugged. Cecilia waited for a directness in Beauchamp&rsquo;s
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father was too wary to leave them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia&rsquo;s intuition told her that by leading to a discussion of politics,
      and adopting Beauchamp&rsquo;s views, she could kindle him. Why did she refrain?
      It was that the conquered young lady was a captive, not an ally. To touch
      the subject in cold blood, voluntarily to launch on those vexed waters, as
      if his cause were her heart&rsquo;s, as much as her heart was the man&rsquo;s, she
      felt to be impossible. He at the same time felt that the heiress, endowing
      him with money to speed the good cause, should be his match in ardour for
      it, otherwise he was but a common adventurer, winning and despoiling an
      heiress.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met in London. Beauchamp had not vacated either Holdesbury or the
      town-house; he was defying his uncle Everard, and Cecilia thought with him
      that it was a wise temerity. She thought with him passively altogether. On
      this occasion she had not to wait for directness in his eyes; she had to
      parry it. They were at a dinner-party at Lady Elsea&rsquo;s, generally the last
      place for seeing Lord Palmet, but he was present, and arranged things
      neatly for them, telling Beauchamp that he acted under Mrs.
      Wardour-Devereux&rsquo;s orders. Never was an opportunity, more propitious for a
      desperate lover. Had it been Renee next him, no petty worldly scruples of
      honour would have held him back. And if Cecilia had spoken feelingly of
      Dr. Shrapnel, or had she simulated a thoughtful interest in his pursuits,
      his hesitations would have vanished. As it was, he dared to look what he
      did not permit himself to speak. She was nobly lovely, and the palpable
      envy of men around cried fool at his delays. Beggar and heiress he said in
      his heart, to vitalize the three-parts fiction of the point of honour
      which Cecilia&rsquo;s beauty was fast submerging. When she was leaving he named
      a day for calling to see her. Colonel Halkett stood by, and she answered,
      &lsquo;Come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp kept the appointment. Cecilia was absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was unaware that her father had taken her to old Mrs. Beauchamp&rsquo;s
      death-bed. Her absence, after she had said, &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; appeared a
      confirmation of her glacial manner when they met at the house of Mrs.
      Wardour-Devereux; and he charged her with waywardness. A wound of the same
      kind that we are inflicting is about the severest we can feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp received intelligence of his venerable great-aunt&rsquo;s death from
      Blackburn Tuckham, and after the funeral he was informed that eighty
      thousand pounds had been bequeathed to him: a goodly sum of money for a
      gentleman recently beggared; yet, as the political enthusiast could not
      help reckoning (apart from a fervent sentiment of gratitude toward his
      benefactress), scarcely enough to do much more than start and push for
      three or more years a commanding daily newspaper, devoted to Radical
      interests, and to be entitled THE DAWN.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, he might now conscientiously approach the heiress, take her hand
      with an open countenance, and retain it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could he do so quite conscientiously? The point of honour had been centred
      in his condition of beggary. Something still was in his way. A quick
      spring of his blood for air, motion, excitement, holiday freedom, sent his
      thoughts travelling whither they always shot away when his redoubtable
      natural temper broke loose.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of any other woman than Cecilia Halkett he would not have been
      obstructed by the minor consideration as to whether he was wholly
      heart-free to ask her in marriage that instant; for there was no
      hindrance, and she was beautiful. She was exceedingly beautiful; and she
      was an unequalled heiress. She would be able with her wealth to float his
      newspaper, THE DAWN, so desired of Dr. Shrapnel!&mdash;the best
      restorative that could be applied to him! Every temptation came
      supplicating him to take the step which indeed he wished for: one feeling
      opposed. He really respected Cecilia: it is not too much to say that he
      worshipped her with the devout worship rendered to the ideal Englishwoman
      by the heart of the nation. For him she was purity, charity, the keeper of
      the keys of whatsoever is held precious by men; she was a midway saint, a
      light between day and darkness, in whom the spirit in the flesh shone like
      the growing star amid thin sanguine colour, the sweeter, the brighter, the
      more translucent the longer known. And if the image will allow it, the
      nearer down to him the holier she seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      How offer himself when he was not perfectly certain that he was worthy of
      her?
    </p>
    <p>
      Some jugglery was played by the adept male heart in these later
      hesitations. Up to the extent of his knowledge of himself, the man was
      fairly sincere. Passion would have sped him to Cecilia, but passion is not
      invariably love; and we know what it can be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glance he cast over the water at Normandy was withdrawn. He went to
      Bevisham to consult with Dr. Shrapnel about the starting of a weekly
      journal, instead of a daily, and a name for it&mdash;a serious question:
      for though it is oftener weekly than daily that the dawn is visible in
      England, titles must not invite the public jest; and the glorious project
      of the daily DAWN was prudently abandoned for by-and-by. He thought
      himself rich enough to put a Radical champion weekly in the field and this
      matter, excepting the title, was arranged in Bevisham. Thence he proceeded
      to Holdesbury, where he heard that the house, grounds, and farm were let
      to a tenant preparing to enter. Indifferent to the blow, he kept an
      engagement to deliver a speech at the great manufacturing town of
      Gunningham, and then went to London, visiting his uncle&rsquo;s town-house for
      recent letters. Not one was from Renee: she had not written for six weeks,
      not once for his thrice! A letter from Cecil Baskelett informed him that
      &lsquo;my lord&rsquo; had placed the town-house at his disposal. Returning to dress
      for dinner on a thick and murky evening of February, Beauchamp encountered
      his cousin on the steps. He said to Cecil, &lsquo;I sleep here to-night: I leave
      the house to you tomorrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecil struck out his underjaw to reply: &lsquo;Oh! good. You sleep here
      to-night. You are a fortunate man. I congratulate you. I shall not disturb
      you. I have just entered on my occupation of the house. I have my key.
      Allow me to recommend you to go straight to the drawing-room. And I may
      inform you that the Earl of Romfrey is at the point of death. My lord is
      at the castle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecil accompanied his descent of the steps with the humming of an opera
      melody: Beauchamp tripped into the hall-passage. A young maid-servant held
      the door open, and she accosted him: &lsquo;If you please, there is a lady
      up-stairs in the drawing-room; she speaks foreign English, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp asked if the lady was alone, and not waiting for the answer,
      though he listened while writing, and heard that she was heavily veiled,
      he tore a strip from his notebook, and carefully traced half-a-dozen
      telegraphic words to Mrs. Culling at Steynham. His rarely failing
      promptness, which was like an inspiration, to conceive and execute
      measures for averting peril, set him on the thought of possibly
      counteracting his cousin Cecil&rsquo;s malignant tongue by means of a message to
      Rosamund, summoning her by telegraph to come to town by the next train
      that night. He despatched the old woman keeping the house, as trustier
      than the young one, to the nearest office, and went up to the
      drawing-room, with a quick thumping heart that was nevertheless as little
      apprehensive of an especial trial and danger as if he had done nothing at
      all to obviate it. Indeed he forgot that he had done anything when he
      turned the handle of the drawing-room door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL. A TRIAL OF HIM
    </h2>
    <p>
      A low-burning lamp and fire cast a narrow ring on the shadows of the dusky
      London room. One of the window-blinds was drawn up. Beauchamp discerned a
      shape at that window, and the fear seized him that it might be Madame
      d&rsquo;Auffray with evil news of Renee: but it was Renee&rsquo;s name he called. She
      rose from her chair, saying, &lsquo;I!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp asked her whisperingly if she had come alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alone; without even a maid,&rsquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled down the blind of the window exposing them to the square, and
      led her into the light to see her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dimness of light annoyed him, and the miserable reception of her; this
      English weather, and the gloomy house! And how long had she been waiting
      for him? and what was the mystery? Renee in England seemed magical; yet it
      was nothing stranger than an old dream realized. He wound up the lamp,
      holding her still with one hand. She was woefully pale; scarcely able to
      bear the increase of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is I who come to you&rsquo;: she was half audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This time!&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;You have been suffering?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tone was brief; not reassuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You came straight to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Without a deviation that I know of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From Tourdestelle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have not forgotten Tourdestelle, Nevil?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The memory of it quickened his rapture in reading her features. It was his
      first love, his enchantress, who was here: and how? Conjectures shot
      through him like lightnings in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irrationally, at a moment when reason stood in awe, he fancied it must be
      that her husband was dead. He forced himself to think it, and could have
      smiled at the hurry of her coming, one, without even a maid: and deeper
      down in him the devouring question burned which dreaded the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of old, in Normandy, she had pledged herself to join him with no delay
      when free, if ever free!
    </p>
    <p>
      So now she was free.
    </p>
    <p>
      One side of him glowed in illumination; the other was black as Winter
      night; but light subdues darkness; and in a situation like Beauchamp&rsquo;s,
      the blood is livelier than the prophetic mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did you tell me to marry? What did that mean?&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Did you wish
      me to be the one in chains? And you have come quite alone!&mdash;you will
      give me an account of everything presently:&mdash;You are here! in
      England! and what a welcome for you! You are cold.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am warmly clad,&rsquo; said Renee, suffering her hand to be drawn to his
      breast at her arm&rsquo;s-length, not bending with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alive to his own indirectness, he was conscious at once of the slight sign
      of reservation, and said: &lsquo;Tell me...&rsquo; and swerved sheer away from his
      question: &lsquo;how is Madame d&rsquo;Auffray?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Agnes? I left her at Tourdestelle,&rsquo; said Renee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Roland? He never writes to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Neither he nor I write much. He is at the military camp of instruction in
      the North.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He will run over to us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not expect it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee sighed. &lsquo;We shall have to live longer than I look for...&rsquo; she
      stopped. &lsquo;Why do you ask me why not? He is fond of us both, and sorry for
      us; but have you forgotten Roland that morning on the Adriatic?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp pressed her hand. The stroke of Then and Now rang in his breast
      like a bell instead of a bounding heart. Something had stunned his heart.
      He had no clear central feeling; he tried to gather it from her touch,
      from his joy in beholding her and sitting with her alone, from the grace
      of her figure, the wild sweetness of her eyes, and the beloved foreign
      lips bewitching him with their exquisite French and perfection of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      His nature was too prompt in responding to such a call on it for resolute
      warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I had been firmer then, or you one year older!&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That girl in Venice had no courage,&rsquo; said Renee.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her head and looked about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her instinct of love sounded her lover through, and felt the deficiency or
      the contrariety in him, as surely as musical ears are pained by a discord
      that they require no touchstone to detect. Passion has the sensitiveness
      of fever, and is as cruelly chilled by a tepid air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, a London house after Venice and Normandy!&rsquo; said Beauchamp, following
      her look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sicily: do not omit Syracuse; you were in your naval uniform: Normandy
      was our third meeting,&rsquo; said Renee. &lsquo;This is the fourth. I should have
      reckoned that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why? Superstitiously?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We cannot be entirely wise when we have staked our fate. Sailors are
      credulous: you know them. Women are like them when they embark... Three
      chances! Who can boast of so many, and expect one more! Will you take me
      to my hotel, Nevil?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fiction of her being free could not be sustained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take you and leave you? I am absolutely at your command. But leave you?
      You are alone: and you have told me nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      What was there to tell? The desperate act was apparent, and told all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee&rsquo;s dark eyelashes lifted on him, and dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then things are as I left them in Normandy?&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied: &lsquo;Almost.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He quivered at the solitary word; for his conscience was on edge. It ran
      the shrewdest irony through him, inexplicably. &lsquo;Almost&rsquo;: that is, &lsquo;with
      this poor difference of one person, now finding herself worthless,
      subtracted from the list; no other; it should be little to them as it is
      little to you&rsquo;: or, reversing it, the substance of the word became
      magnified and intensified by its humble slightness: &lsquo;Things are the same,
      but for the jewel of the province, a lustre of France, lured hither to her
      eclipse&rsquo;&mdash;meanings various, indistinguishable, thrilling and piercing
      sad as the half-tones humming round the note of a strung wire, which is a
      blunt single note to the common ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp sprang to his feet and bent above her: &lsquo;You have come to me, for
      the love of me, to give yourself to me, and for ever, for good, till
      death? Speak, my beloved Renee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were raised to his: &lsquo;You see me here. It is for you to speak.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do. There&rsquo;s nothing I ask for now&mdash;if the step can&rsquo;t be
      retrieved.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The step retrieved, my friend? There is no step backward in life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am thinking of you, Renee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I know,&rsquo; she answered hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If we discover that the step is a wrong one?&rsquo; he pursued: &lsquo;why is there
      no step backward?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am talking of women,&rsquo; said Renee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not for women?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Honourable women, I mean,&rsquo; said Renee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp inclined to forget his position in finding matter to contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it is beyond contest that there is no step backward in life. She spoke
      well; better than he, and she won his deference by it. Not only she spoke
      better: she was truer, distincter, braver: and a man ever on the look-out
      for superior qualities, and ready to bow to them, could not refuse her
      homage. With that a saving sense of power quitted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wrote to me that you were unchanged, Nevil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So, then, I came.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His rejoinder was the dumb one, commonly eloquent and satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee shut her eyes with a painful rigour of endurance. She opened them to
      look at him steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The desperate act of her flight demanded immediate recognition from him in
      simple language and a practical seconding of it. There was the test.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot stay in this house, Nevil; take me away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She named her hotel in her French English, and the sound of it penetrated
      him with remorseful pity. It was for him, and of his doing, that she was
      in an alien land and an outcast!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This house is wretched for you,&rsquo; said he: &lsquo;and you must be hungry. Let
      me...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot eat. I will ask you&rsquo;: she paused, drawing on her energies, and
      keeping down the throbs of her heart: &lsquo;this: do you love me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I love you with all my heart and soul.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As in Normandy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In Venice?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As from the first, Renee! That I can swear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oaths are foolish. I meant to ask you&mdash;my friend, there is no
      question in my mind of any other woman: I see you love me: I am so used to
      consider myself the vain and cowardly creature, and you the boldest and
      faithfullest of men, that I could not abandon the habit if I would: I
      started confiding in you, sure that I should come to land. But I have to
      ask you: to me you are truth: I have no claim on my lover for anything but
      the answer to this:&mdash;Am I a burden to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His brows flew up in furrows. He drew a heavy breath, for never had he
      loved her more admiringly, and never on such equal terms. She was his mate
      in love and daring at least. A sorrowful comparison struck him, of a
      little boat sailing out to a vessel in deep seas and left to founder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without knotting his mind to acknowledge or deny the burden, for he could
      do neither, he stood silent, staring at her, not so much in weakness as in
      positive mental division. No, would be false; and Yes, not less false; and
      if the step was irretrievable, to say Yes would be to plunge a dagger in
      her bosom; but No was a vain deceit involving a double wreck. Assuredly a
      man standing against the world in a good cause, with a runaway wife on his
      hands, carries a burden, however precious it be to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile of her lips, parted in an anguish of expectancy, went to death
      over Renee&rsquo;s face. She looked at him tenderly. &lsquo;The truth,&rsquo; she murmured
      to herself, and her eyelids fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am ready to bear anything,&rsquo; said Beauchamp. &lsquo;I weigh what you ask me,
      that is all. You a burden to me? But when you ask me, you make me turn
      round and inquire how we stand before the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The world does not stone men,&rsquo; said Renee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t I make you feel that I am not thinking of myself?&rsquo; Beauchamp
      stamped in his extreme perplexity. He was gagged; he could not possibly
      talk to her, who had cast the die, of his later notions of morality and
      the world&rsquo;s dues, fees, and claims on us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, friend, I am not complaining.&rsquo; Renee put out her hand to him; with
      compassionate irony feigning to have heard excuses. &lsquo;What right have I to
      complain? I have not the sensation. I could not expect you to be
      everlastingly the sentinel of love. Three times I rejected you! Now that I
      have lost my father&mdash;Oh! poor father: I trifled with my lover, I
      tricked him that my father might live in peace. He is dead. I wished you
      to marry one of your own countrywomen, Nevil. You said it was impossible;
      and I, with my snake at my heart, and a husband grateful for nursing and
      whimpering to me for his youth like a beggar on the road, I thought I owed
      you this debt of body and soul, to prove to you I have some courage; and
      for myself, to reward myself for my long captivity and misery with one
      year of life: and adieu to Roland my brother! adieu to friends! adieu to
      France! Italy was our home. I dreamed of one year in Italy; I fancied it
      might be two; more than that was unimaginable. Prisoners of long date do
      not hope; they do not calculate: air, light, they say; to breathe freely
      and drop down! They are reduced to the instincts of the beasts. I thought
      I might give you happiness, pay part of my debt to you. Are you
      remembering Count Henri? That paints what I was! I could fly to that for a
      taste of life! a dance to death! And again you ask: Why, if I loved you
      then, not turn to you in preference? No, you have answered it yourself,
      Nevil;&mdash;on that day in the boat, when generosity in a man so
      surprised me, it seemed a miracle to me; and it was, in its divination.
      How I thank my dear brother Roland for saving me the sight of you
      condemned to fight, against your conscience! He taught poor M. d&rsquo;Henriel
      his lesson. You, Nevil, were my teacher. And see how it hangs: there was
      mercy for me in not having drawn down my father&rsquo;s anger on my heart&rsquo;s
      beloved. He loved you. He pitied us. He reproached himself. In his last
      days he was taught to suspect our story: perhaps from Roland; perhaps I
      breathed it without speaking. He called heaven&rsquo;s blessings on you. He
      spoke of you with tears, clutching my hand. He made me feel he would have
      cried out: &ldquo;If I were leaving her with Nevil Beauchamp!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beauchamp,&rdquo;
       I heard him murmuring once: &ldquo;take down Froissart&rdquo;: he named a chapter. It
      was curious: if he uttered my name Renee, yours, &ldquo;Nevil,&rdquo; soon followed.
      That was noticed by Roland. Hope for us, he could not have had; as little
      as I! But we were his two: his children. I buried him&mdash;I thought he
      would know our innocence, and now pardon our love. I read your letters,
      from my name at the beginning, to yours at the end, and from yours back to
      mine, and between the lines, for any doubtful spot: and oh, rash! But I
      would not retrace the step for my own sake. I am certain of your love for
      me, though...&rsquo; She paused: &lsquo;Yes, I am certain of it. And if I am a burden
      to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About as much as the air, which I can&rsquo;t do without since I began to
      breathe it,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, more clear-mindedly now that he supposed he
      was addressing a mind, and with a peril to himself that escaped his
      vigilance. There was a secret intoxication for him already in the
      half-certainty that the step could not be retraced. The idea that he might
      reason with her, made her seductive to the heart and head of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am passably rich, Nevil,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I do not care for money, except
      that it gives wings. Roland inherits the chateau in Touraine. I have one
      in Burgundy, and rentes and shares, my notary informs me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have money,&rsquo; said he. His heart began beating violently. He lost sight
      of his intention of reasoning. &lsquo;Good God! if you were free!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She faltered: &lsquo;At Tourdestelle...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, and I am unchanged,&rsquo; Beauchamp cried out. &lsquo;Your life there was
      horrible, and mine&rsquo;s intolerable.&rsquo; He stretched his arms cramped like the
      yawning of a wretch in fetters. That which he would and would not became
      so intervolved that he deemed it reasonable to instance their common
      misery as a ground for their union against the world. And what has that
      world done for us, that a joy so immeasurable should be rejected on its
      behalf? And what have we succeeded in doing, that the childish effort to
      move it should be continued at such a cost?
    </p>
    <p>
      For years, down to one year back, and less&mdash;yesterday, it could be
      said&mdash;all human blessedness appeared to him in the person of Renee,
      given him under any condition whatsoever. She was not less adorable now.
      In her decision, and a courage that he especially prized in women, she was
      a sweeter to him than when he was with her in France: too sweet to be
      looked at and refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But we must live in England,&rsquo; he cried abruptly out of his inner mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! not England, Italy, Italy!&rsquo; Renee exclaimed: &lsquo;Italy, or Greece:
      anywhere where we have sunlight. Mountains and valleys are my dream.
      Promise it, Nevil. I will obey you; but this is my wish. Take me through
      Venice, that I may look at myself and wonder. We can live at sea, in a
      yacht; anywhere with you but in England. This country frowns on me; I can
      hardly fetch my breath here, I am suffocated. The people all walk in lines
      in England. Not here, Nevil! They are good people, I am sure; and it is
      your country: but their faces chill me, their voices grate; I should never
      understand them; they would be to me like their fogs eternally; and I to
      them? O me! it would be like hearing sentence in the dampness of the
      shroud perpetually. Again I say I do not doubt that they are very good:
      they claim to be; they judge others; they may know how to make themselves
      happy in their climate; it is common to most creatures to do so, or to
      imagine it. Nevil! not England!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly &lsquo;the mad commander and his French marquise&rsquo; of the Bevisham Election
      ballad would make a pretty figure in England!
    </p>
    <p>
      His friends of his own class would be mouthing it. The story would be a
      dogging shadow of his public life, and, quite as bad, a reflection on his
      party. He heard the yelping tongues of the cynics. He saw the
      consternation and grief of his old Bevisham hero, his leader and his
      teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Florence,&rsquo; he said, musing on the prospect of exile and idleness:
      &lsquo;there&rsquo;s a kind of society to be had in Florence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee asked him if he cared so much for society.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied that women must have it, just as men must have exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old women, Nevil; intriguers, tattlers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Young women, Renee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She signified no.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook the head of superior knowledge paternally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her instinct of comedy set a dimple faintly working in her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not if they love, Nevil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At least,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;a man does not like to see the woman he loves
      banished by society and browbeaten.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Putting me aside, do you care for it, Nevil?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Personally not a jot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am convinced of that,&rsquo; said Renee.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke suspiciously sweetly, appearing perfect candour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The change in him was perceptible to her. The nature of the change was
      unfathomable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried her wits at the riddle. But though she could be an actress
      before him with little difficulty, the torment of her situation roused the
      fever within her at a bare effort to think acutely. Scarlet suffused her
      face: her brain whirled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Remember, dearest, I have but offered myself: you have your choice. I can
      pass on. Yes, I know well I speak to Nevil Beauchamp; you have drilled me
      to trust you and your word as a soldier trusts to his officer&mdash;once a
      faint-hearted soldier! I need not remind you: fronting the enemy now, in
      hard truth. But I want your whole heart to decide. Give me no silly,
      compassion! Would it have been better to me to have written to you? If I
      had written I should have clipped my glorious impulse, brought myself down
      to earth with my own arrow. I did not write, for I believed in you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So firm had been her faith in him that her visions of him on the passage
      to England had resolved all to one flash of blood-warm welcome awaiting
      her: and it says much for her natural generosity that the savage delicacy
      of a woman placed as she now was, did not take a mortal hurt from the
      apparent voidness of this home of his bosom. The passionate gladness of
      the lover was wanting: the chivalrous valiancy of manful joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee shivered at the cloud thickening over her new light of intrepid
      defiant life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think it not improbable that I have weighed everything I surrender in
      quitting France,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remorse wrestled with Beauchamp and flung him at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee remarked on the lateness of the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      He promised to conduct her to her hotel immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And to-morrow?&rsquo; said Renee, simply, but breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow, let it be Italy! But first I telegraph to Roland and
      Tourdestelle. I can&rsquo;t run and hide. The step may be retrieved: or no, you
      are right; the step cannot, but the next to it may be stopped&mdash;that
      was the meaning I had! I &lsquo;ll try. It &lsquo;s cutting my hand off, tearing my
      heart out; but I will. O that you were free! You left your husband at
      Tourdestelle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I presume he is there at present: he was in Paris when I left.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp spoke hoarsely and incoherently in contrast with her composure:
      &lsquo;You will misunderstand me for a day or two, Renee. I say if you were free
      I should have my first love mine for ever. Don&rsquo;t fear me: I have no right
      even to press your fingers. He may throw you into my arms. Now you are the
      same as if you were in your own home: and you must accept me for your
      guide. By all I hope for in life, I&rsquo;ll see you through it, and keep the
      dogs from barking, if I can. Thousands are ready to give tongue. And if
      they can get me in the character of a law-breaker!&mdash;I hear them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you imagining, Nevil, that there is a possibility of my returning to
      him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To your place in the world! You have not had to endure tyranny?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should have had a certain respect for a tyrant, Nevil. At least I
      should have had an occupation in mocking him and conspiring against him.
      Tyranny! There would have been some amusement to me in that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was neglect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I could still charge it on neglect, Nevil! Neglect is very endurable.
      He rewards me for nursing him... he rewards me with a little persecution:
      wives should be flattered by it: it comes late.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; cried Beauchamp, oppressed and impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee sank her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in the run of the unaccented French: &lsquo;Son amour, mon ami&rsquo;: drove
      the significance of the bitterness of the life she had left behind her
      burningly through him. This was to have fled from a dragon! was the
      lover&rsquo;s thought: he perceived the motive of her flight: and it was a
      vindication of it that appealed to him irresistibly. The proposal for her
      return grew hideous: and this ever multiplying horror and sting of the
      love of a married woman came on him with a fresh throbbing shock, more
      venom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt for himself now, and now he was full of feeling for her.
      Impossible that she should return! Tourdestelle shone to him like a gaping
      chasm of fire. And becoming entirely selfish he impressed his total
      abnegation of self upon Renee so that she could have worshipped him. A
      lover that was like a starry frost, froze her veins, bewildered her
      intelligence. She yearned for meridian warmth, for repose in a directing
      hand; and let it be hard as one that grasps a sword: what matter?
      unhesitatingness was the warrior virtue of her desire. And for herself the
      worst might happen if only she were borne along. Let her life be torn and
      streaming like the flag of battle, it must be forward to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a quality of godless young heroism not unexhausted in Beauchamp&rsquo;s
      blood. Reanimated by him, she awakened his imagination of the vagrant
      splendours of existence and the rebel delights which have their own laws
      and &lsquo;nature&rsquo; for an applauding mother. Radiant Alps rose in his eyes, and
      the morning born in the night suns that from mountain and valley, over sea
      and desert, called on all earth to witness their death. The magnificence
      of the contempt of humanity posed before him superbly satanesque, grand as
      thunder among the crags and it was not a sensual cry that summoned him
      from his pedlar labours, pack on back along the level road, to live and
      breathe deep, gloriously mated: Renee kindled his romantic spirit, and
      could strike the feeling into him that to be proud of his possession of
      her was to conquer the fretful vanity to possess. She was not a woman of
      wiles and lures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice she consulted her watch: but as she professed to have no
      hunger, Beauchamp&rsquo;s entreaty to her to stay prevailed, and the subtle form
      of compliment to his knightly manliness in her remaining with him, gave
      him a new sense of pleasure that hung round her companionable
      conversation, deepening the meaning of the words, or sometimes contrasting
      the sweet surface commonplace with the undercurrent of strangeness in
      their hearts, and the reality of a tragic position. Her musical volubility
      flowed to entrance and divert him, as it did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Beauchamp glanced upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee turned from a startled contemplation of his frown, and beheld Mrs.
      Rosamund Culling in the room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI. A LAME VICTORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The intruder was not a person that had power to divide them; yet she came
      between their hearts with a touch of steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am here in obedience to your commands in your telegram of this
      evening,&rsquo; Rosamund replied to Beauchamp&rsquo;s hard stare at her; she
      courteously spoke French, and acquitted herself demurely of a bow to the
      lady present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee withdrew her serious eyes from Beauchamp. She rose and acknowledged
      the bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is my first visit to England, madame!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could have desired, Madame la marquise, more agreeable weather for
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friends in England will dispel the bad weather for me, madame&rsquo;; Renee
      smiled softly: &lsquo;I have been studying my French-English phrase-book, that I
      may learn how dialogues are conducted in your country to lead to certain
      ceremonies when old friends meet, and without my book I am at fault. I am
      longing to be embraced by you... if it will not be offending your rules?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund succumbed to the seductive woman, whose gentle tooth bit through
      her tutored simplicity of manner and natural graciousness, administering
      its reproof, and eluding a retort or an excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave the embrace. In doing so she fell upon her conscious awkwardness
      for an expression of reserve that should be as good as irony for irony,
      though where Madame de Rouaillout&rsquo;s irony lay, or whether it was irony at
      all, our excellent English dame could not have stated, after the feeling
      of indignant prudery responding to it so guiltily had subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp asked her if she had brought servants with her; and it gratified
      her to see that he was no actor fitted to carry a scene through in
      virtue&rsquo;s name and vice&rsquo;s mask with this actress.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied, &lsquo;I have brought a man and a maid-servant. The establishment
      will be in town the day after tomorrow, in time for my lord&rsquo;s return from
      the Castle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can have them up to-morrow morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could,&rsquo; Rosamund admitted the possibility. Her idolatry of him was
      tried on hearing him press the hospitality of the house upon Madame de
      Rouaillout, and observing the lady&rsquo;s transparent feint of a reluctant
      yielding. For the voluble Frenchwoman scarcely found a word to utter: she
      protested languidly that she preferred the independence of her hotel, and
      fluttered a singular look at him, as if overcome by his vehement
      determination to have her in the house. Undoubtedly she had a taking face
      and style. His infatuation, nevertheless, appeared to Rosamund utter
      dementedness, considering this woman&rsquo;s position, and Cecilia Halkett&rsquo;s
      beauty and wealth, and that the house was no longer at his disposal. He
      was really distracted, to judge by his forehead, or else he was
      over-acting his part.
    </p>
    <p>
      The absence of a cook in the house, Rosamund remarked, must prevent her
      from seconding Captain Beauchamp&rsquo;s invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned on her witheringly. &lsquo;The telegraph will do that. You&rsquo;re in
      London; cooks can be had by dozens. Madame de Rouaillout is alone here;
      she has come to see a little of England, and you will do the honours of
      the house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;M. le marquis is not in London?&rsquo; said Rosamund, disregarding the dumb
      imprecation she saw on Beauchamp&rsquo;s features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, madame, my husband is not in London,&rsquo; Renee rejoined collectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See to the necessary comforts of the house instantly,&rsquo; said Beauchamp,
      and telling Renee, without listening to her, that he had to issue orders,
      he led Rosamund, who was out of breath at the effrontery of the pair,
      toward the door. &lsquo;Are you blind, ma&rsquo;am? Have you gone foolish? What should
      I have sent for you for, but to protect her? I see your mind; and off with
      the prude, pray! Madame will have my room; clear away every sign of me
      there. I sleep out; I can find a bed anywhere. And bolt and chain the
      house-door to-night against Cecil Baskelett; he informs me that he has
      taken possession.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund&rsquo;s countenance had become less austere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Captain Baskelett!&rsquo; she exclaimed, leaning to Beauchamp&rsquo;s views on the
      side of her animosity to Cecil; &lsquo;he has been promised by his uncle the use
      of a set of rooms during the year, when the mistress of the house is not
      in occupation. I stipulated expressly that he was to see you and suit
      himself to your convenience, and to let me hear that you and he had agreed
      to an arrangement, before he entered the house. He has no right to be
      here, and I shall have no hesitation in locking him out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp bade her go, and not be away more than five minutes; and then he
      would drive to the hotel for the luggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      She scanned him for a look of ingenuousness that might be trusted, and
      laughed in her heart at her credulity for expecting it of a man in such a
      case. She saw Renee sitting stonily, too proudly self-respecting to put on
      a mask of flippant ease. These lovers might be accomplices in deceiving
      her; they were not happy ones, and that appeared to her to be some
      assurance that she did well in obeying him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp closed the door on her. He walked back to Renee with a
      thoughtful air that was consciously acted; his only thought being&mdash;now
      she knows me!
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee looked up at him once. Her eyes were unaccusing, unquestioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the violation of the secresy of her flight she had lost her
      initiative and her intrepidity. The world of human eyes glared on her
      through the windows of the two she had been exposed to, paralyzing her
      brain and caging her spirit of revolt. That keen wakefulness of her
      self-defensive social instinct helped her to an understanding of her
      lover&rsquo;s plan to preserve her reputation, or rather to give her a corner of
      retreat in shielding the worthless thing&mdash;twice detested as her cloak
      of slavery coming from him! She comprehended no more. She was a house of
      nerves crowding in against her soul like fiery thorns, and had no space
      within her torture for a sensation of gratitude or suspicion; but feeling
      herself hurried along at lightning speed to some dreadful shock, her
      witless imagination apprehended it in his voice: not what he might say,
      only the sound. She feared to hear him speak, as the shrinking ear fears a
      thunder at the cavity; yet suspense was worse than the downward-driving
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pang struck her when he uttered some words about Mrs. Culling, and
      protection, and Roland.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thanked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So have common executioners been thanked by queenly ladies baring their
      necks to the axe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called up the pain he suffered to vindicate him; and it was really an
      agony of a man torn to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have done the best.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This dogged and stupid piece of speech was pitiable to hear from Nevil
      Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think so?&rsquo; said she; and her glass-like voice rang a tremour in its
      mildness that swelled through him on the plain submissive note, which was
      more assent than question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure of it. I believe it. I see it. At least I hope so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are chiefly led by hope,&rsquo; said Renee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At least, if not!&rsquo; Beauchamp cried. &lsquo;And it&rsquo;s not too late. I have no
      right&mdash;I do what I can. I am at your mercy. Judge me later. If I am
      ever to know what happiness is, it will be with you. It&rsquo;s not too late
      either way. There is Roland&mdash;my brother as much as if you were my
      wife!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He begged her to let him have Roland&rsquo;s exact address.
    </p>
    <p>
      She named the regiment, the corps d&rsquo;armee, the postal town, and the
      department.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Roland will come at a signal,&rsquo; he pursued; &lsquo;we are not bound to consult
      others.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee formed the French word of &lsquo;we&rsquo; on her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked of Roland and Roland, his affection for him as a brother and as
      a friend, and Roland&rsquo;s love of them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is true,&rsquo; said Renee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We owe him this; he represents your father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All that you say is true, my friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thus, you have come on a visit to madame, your old friend here&mdash;oh!
      your hand. What have I done?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renee motioned her hand as if it were free to be taken, and smiled faintly
      to make light of it, but did not give it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you had been widowed!&rsquo; he broke down to the lover again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That man is attached to the remnant of his life: I could not wish him
      dispossessed of it,&rsquo; said Rende.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Parted! who parts us? It&rsquo;s for a night. Tomorrow!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She breathed: &lsquo;To-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To his hearing it craved an answer. He had none. To talk like a lover, or
      like a man of honour, was to lie. Falsehood hemmed him in to the narrowest
      ring that ever statue stood on, if he meant to be stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That woman will be returning,&rsquo; he muttered, frowning at the vacant door.
      &lsquo;I could lay out my whole life before your eyes, and show you I am
      unchanged in my love of you since the night when Roland and I walked on
      the Piazzetta...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not remind me; let those days lie black!&rsquo; A sympathetic vision of her
      maiden&rsquo;s tears on the night of wonderful moonlight when, as it seemed to
      her now, San Giorgio stood like a dark prophet of her present abasement
      and chastisement, sprang tears of a different character, and weak as she
      was with her soul&rsquo;s fever and for want of food, she was piteously shaken.
      She said with some calmness: &lsquo;It is useless to look back. I have no
      reproaches but for myself. Explain nothing to me. Things that are not
      comprehended by one like me are riddles I must put aside. I know where I
      am: I scarcely know more. Here is madame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The door had not opened, and it did not open immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp had time to say, &lsquo;Believe in me.&rsquo; Even that was false to his own
      hearing, and in a struggle with the painful impression of insincerity
      which was denied and scorned by his impulse to fling his arms round her
      and have her his for ever, he found himself deferentially accepting her
      brief directions concerning her boxes at the hotel, with Rosamund Culling
      to witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed over the fingers. &lsquo;Until to-morrow, madame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Adieu!&rsquo; said Renee.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLII. THE TWO PASSIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The foggy February night refreshed his head, and the business of fetching
      the luggage from the hotel&mdash;a commission that necessitated the
      delivery of his card and some very commanding language&mdash;kept his mind
      in order. Subsequently he drove to his cousin Baskelett&rsquo;s Club, where he
      left a short note to say the house was engaged for the night and perhaps a
      week further. Concise, but sufficient: and he stated a hope to his cousin
      that he would not be inconvenienced. This was courteous.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had taken a bed at Renee&rsquo;s hotel, after wresting her boxes from the
      vanquished hotel proprietor, and lay there, hearing the clear sound of
      every little sentence of hers during the absence of Rosamund: her &lsquo;Adieu,&rsquo; 
      and the strange &lsquo;Do you think so?&rsquo; and &lsquo;I know where I am; I scarcely know
      more.&rsquo; Her eyes and their darker lashes, and the fitful little sensitive
      dimples of a smile without joy, came with her voice, but hardened to an
      aspect unlike her. Not a word could he recover of what she had spoken
      before Rosamund&rsquo;s intervention. He fancied she must have related details
      of her journey. Especially there must have been mention, he thought, of
      her drive to the station from Tourdestelle; and this flashed on him the
      scene of his ride to the chateau, and the meeting her on the road, and the
      white light on the branching river, and all that was Renee in the spirit
      of the place she had abandoned for him, believing in him. She had proved
      that she believed in him. What in the name of sanity had been the meaning
      of his language? and what was it between them that arrested him and caused
      him to mumble absurdly of &lsquo;doing best,&rsquo; when in fact he was her bondman,
      rejoiced to be so, by his pledged word? and when she, for some reason that
      he was sure she had stated, though he could recollect no more than the
      formless hideousness of it, was debarred from returning to Tourdestelle?
    </p>
    <p>
      He tossed in his bed as over a furnace, in the extremity of perplexity of
      one accustomed to think himself ever demonstrably in the right, and now
      with his whole nature in insurrection against that legitimate claim. It
      led him to accuse her of a want of passionate warmth, in her not having
      supplicated and upbraided him&mdash;not behaving theatrically, in fine, as
      the ranting pen has made us expect of emergent ladies that they will
      naturally do. Concerning himself, he thought commendingly, a tear would
      have overcome him. She had not wept. The kaleidoscope was shaken in his
      fragmentary mind, and she appeared thrice adorable for this noble
      composure, he brutish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conscience and reason had resolved to a dead weight in him, like an
      inanimate force, governing his acts despite the man, while he was with
      Renee. Now his wishes and waverings conjured up a semblance of a
      conscience and much reason to assure him that he had done foolishly as
      well as unkindly, most unkindly: that he was even the ghastly spectacle of
      a creature attempting to be more than he can be. Are we never to embrace
      our inclinations? Are the laws regulating an old dry man like his teacher
      and guide to be the same for the young and vigorous?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is a good gift to be refused? And this was his first love! The brilliant
      Renee, many-hued as a tropic bird! his lady of shining grace, with her
      sole fault of want of courage devotedly amended! his pupil, he might say,
      of whom he had foretold that she must come to such a pass, at the same
      time prefixing his fidelity. And he was handing her over knowingly to one
      kind of wretchedness&mdash;&lsquo;son amour, mon ami,&rsquo; shot through him,
      lighting up the gulfs of a mind in wreck;&mdash;and one kind of happiness
      could certainly be promised her!
    </p>
    <p>
      All these and innumerable other handsome pleadings of the simulacra of the
      powers he had set up to rule, were crushed at daybreak by the realities in
      a sense of weight that pushed him mechanically on. He telegraphed to
      Roland, and mentally gave chase to the message to recall it. The slumberer
      roused in darkness by the relentless insane-seeming bell which hales him
      to duty, melts at the charms of sleep, and feels that logic is with him in
      his preference of his pillow; but the tireless revolving world outside,
      nature&rsquo;s pitiless antagonist, has hung one of its balances about him, and
      his actions are directed by the state of the scales, wherein duty weighs
      deep and desireability swings like a pendant doll: so he throws on his
      harness, astounded, till his blood quickens with work, at the round of
      sacrifices demanded of nature: which is indeed curious considering what we
      are taught here and there as to the infallibility of our august mother.
      Well, the world of humanity had done this for Beauchamp. His afflicted
      historian is compelled to fling his net among prosaic similitudes for an
      illustration of one thus degradedly in its grip. If he had been off with
      his love like the rover! why, then the Muse would have loosened her lap
      like May showering flower-buds, and we might have knocked great nature up
      from her sleep to embellish his desperate proceedings with hurricanes to
      be danced over, to say nothing of imitative spheres dashing out into
      hurly-burly after his example.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conscious rectitude, too, after the pattern of the well-behaved AEneas
      quitting the fair bosom of Carthage in obedience to the Gods, for an
      example to his Roman progeny, might have stiffened his backbone and put a
      crown upon his brows. It happened with him that his original training
      rather imposed the idea that he was a figure to be derided. The approval
      of him by the prudent was a disgust, and by the pious tasteless. He had
      not any consolation in reverting to Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s heavy Puritanism. On
      the contrary, such a general proposition as that of the sage of Bevisham
      could not for a moment stand against the pathetic special case of Renee:
      and as far as Beauchamp&rsquo;s active mind went, he was for demanding that
      Society should take a new position in morality, considerably broader, and
      adapted to very special cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless he was hardly grieved in missing Renee at Rosamund&rsquo;s
      breakfast-table. Rosamund informed him that Madame de Rouaillout&rsquo;s door
      was locked. Her particular news for him was of a disgraceful alarum raised
      by Captain Baskelett in the night, to obtain admission; and of an
      interview she had with him in the early morning, when he subjected her to
      great insolence. Beauchamp&rsquo;s attention was drawn to her repetition of the
      phrase &lsquo;mistress of the house.&rsquo; However, she did him justice in regard to
      Renee, and thoroughly entered into the fiction of Renee&rsquo;s visit to her as
      her guest: he passed over everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      To stop the mouth of a scandal-monger, he drove full speed to Cecil&rsquo;s
      Club, where he heard that the captain had breakfasted and had just
      departed for Romfrey Castle. He followed to the station. The train had
      started. So mischief was rolling in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late at night Rosamund was allowed to enter the chill unlighted chamber,
      where the unhappy lady had been lying for hours in the gloom of a London
      Winter&rsquo;s daylight and gaslight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madame de Rouaillout is indisposed with headache,&rsquo; was her report to
      Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conventional phraseology appeased him, though he saw his grief behind
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he asked if Renee had taken food.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No: you know what a headache is,&rsquo; Rosamund replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that we do not care to eat when we are in pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked if she looked ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She will not have lights in the room,&rsquo; said Rosamund.
    </p>
    <p>
      Piecemeal he gained the picture of Renee in an image of the death within
      which welcomed a death without.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund was impatient with him for speaking of medical aid. These men!
      She remarked very honestly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no; doctors are not needed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has she mentioned me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you swing your watch-chain, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; cried Beauchamp, bounding off
      his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reproached her with either pretending to indifference or feeling it;
      and then insisted on his privilege of going up-stairs-accompanied by her,
      of course; and then it was to be only to the door; then an answer to a
      message was to satisfy him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any message would trouble her: what message would you send?&rsquo; Rosamund
      asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weighty and the trivial contended; no fitting message could be thought
      of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are unused to real suffering&mdash;that is for women!&mdash;and want
      to be doing instead of enduring,&rsquo; said Rosamund.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was beginning to put faith in the innocence of these two mortally sick
      lovers. Beauchamp&rsquo;s outcries against himself gave her the shadows of their
      story. He stood in tears&mdash;a thing to see to believe of Nevil
      Beauchamp; and plainly he did not know it, or else he would have taken her
      advice to him to leave the house at an hour that was long past midnight.
      Her method for inducing him to go was based on her intimate knowledge of
      him: she made as if to soothe and kiss him compassionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning there was a flying word from Roland, on his way to England.
      Rosamund tempered her report of Renee by saying of her, that she was very
      quiet. He turned to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look, what a climate ours is!&rsquo; Beauchamp abused the persistent fog.
      &lsquo;Dull, cold, no sky, a horrible air to breathe! This is what she has come
      to! Has she spoken of me yet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is she dead silent?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She answers, if I speak to her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, &lsquo;that we are the coldest-hearted
      people in Europe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund did not defend us, or the fog. Consequently nothing was left for
      him to abuse but himself. In that she tried to moderate him, and drew
      forth a torrent of self-vituperation, after which he sank into the
      speechless misery he had been evading; until sophistical fancy, another
      evolution of his nature, persuaded him that Roland, seeing Renee, would
      for love&rsquo;s sake be friendly to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should have told you, Nevil, by the way, that the earl is dead,&rsquo; said
      Rosamund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her brother will be here to-day; he can&rsquo;t be later than the evening,&rsquo; 
      said Beauchamp. &lsquo;Get her to eat, ma&rsquo;am; you must. Command her to eat. This
      terrible starvation!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ate nothing yourself, Nevil, all day yesterday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He surveyed the table. &lsquo;You have your cook in town, I see. Here&rsquo;s a
      breakfast to feed twenty hungry families in Spitalfields. Where does the
      mass of meat go? One excess feeds another. You&rsquo;re overdone with servants.
      Gluttony, laziness, and pilfering come of your host of unmanageable
      footmen and maids; you stuff them, and wonder they&rsquo;re idle and immoral. If&mdash;I
      suppose I must call him the earl now, or Colonel Halkett, or any one of
      the army of rich men, hear of an increase of the income-tax, or some poor
      wretch hints at a sliding scale of taxation, they yell as if they were
      thumb-screwed: but five shillings in the pound goes to the kitchen as a
      matter of course&mdash;to puff those pompous idiots! and the parsons, who
      should be preaching against this sheer waste of food and perversion of the
      strength of the nation, as a public sin, are maundering about schism.
      There&rsquo;s another idle army! Then we have artists, authors, lawyers, doctors&mdash;the
      honourable professions! all hanging upon wealth, all ageing the rich, and
      all bearing upon labour! it&rsquo;s incubus on incubus. In point of fact, the
      rider&rsquo;s too heavy for the horse in England.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to nibble at bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund pushed over to him a plate of the celebrated Steynham pie, of her
      own invention, such as no douse in the county of Sussex could produce or
      imitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What would you have the parsons do?&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take the rich by the throat and show them in the kitchen-mirror that
      they&rsquo;re swine running down to the sea with a devil in them.&rsquo; She had set
      him off again, but she had enticed him to eating. &lsquo;Pooh! it has all been
      said before. Stones are easier to move than your English. May I be
      forgiven for saying it! an invasion is what they want to bring them to
      their senses. I&rsquo;m sick of the work. Why should I be denied&mdash;am I to
      kill the woman I love that I may go on hammering at them? Their idea of
      liberty is, an evasion of public duty. Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s right&mdash;it&rsquo;s a
      money-logged Island! Men like the Earl of Romfrey, who have never done
      work in their days except to kill bears and birds, I say they&rsquo;re stifled
      by wealth: and he at least would have made an Admiral of mark, or a
      General: not of much value, but useful in case of need. But he, like a
      pretty woman, was under no obligation to contribute more than an
      ornamental person to the common good. As to that, we count him by tens of
      thousands now, and his footmen and maids by hundreds of thousands. The
      rich love the nation through their possessions; otherwise they have no
      country. If they loved the country they would care for the people. Their
      hearts are eaten up by property. I am bidden to hold my tongue because I
      have no knowledge. When men who have this &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; will go down to the
      people, speak to them, consult and argue with them, and come into suitable
      relations with them&mdash;I don&rsquo;t say of lords and retainers, but of
      knowers and doers, leaders and followers&mdash;out of consideration for
      public safety, if not for the common good, I shall hang back gladly;
      though I won&rsquo;t hear misstatements. My fault is, that I am too moderate. I
      should respect myself more if I deserved their hatred. This flood of
      luxury, which is, as Dr. Shrapnel says, the body&rsquo;s drunkenness and the
      soul&rsquo;s death, cries for execration. I&rsquo;m too moderate. But I shall quit the
      country: I&rsquo;ve no place here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund ahemed. &lsquo;France, Nevil? I should hardly think that France would
      please you, in the present state of things over there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Half cynically, with great satisfaction, she had watched him fretting at
      the savoury morsels of her pie with a fork like a sparrow-beak during the
      monologue that would have been so dreary to her but for her appreciation
      of the wholesome effect of the letting off of steam, and her admiration of
      the fire of his eyes. After finishing his plate he had less the look of a
      ship driving on to reef&mdash;some of his images of the country. He called
      for claret and water, sighing as he munched bread in vast portions,
      evidently conceiving that to eat unbuttered bread was to abstain from
      luxury. He praised passingly the quality of the bread. It came from
      Steynham, and so did the milk and cream, the butter, chicken and eggs. He
      was good enough not to object to the expenditure upon the transmission of
      the accustomed dainties. Altogether the gradual act of nibbling had
      conduced to his eating remarkably well-royally. Rosamund&rsquo;s more than
      half-cynical ideas of men, and her custom of wringing unanimous verdicts
      from a jury of temporary impressions, inclined her to imagine him a lover
      that had not to be so very much condoled with, and a politician less
      alarming in practice than in theory:&mdash;somewhat a gentleman of
      domestic tirades on politics: as it is observed of your generous young
      Radical of birth and fortune, that he will become on the old high road to
      a round Conservatism.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pitched one of the morning papers to the floor in disorderly sheets,
      muttering: &lsquo;So they&rsquo;re at me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Dr. Shrapnel better?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;I hold to a good appetite as a sign
      of a man&rsquo;s recovery.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp was confronting the fog at the window. He swung round: &lsquo;Dr.
      Shrapnel is better. He has a particularly clever young female cook.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! then...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, then, naturally! He would naturally hasten to recover to partake of
      the viands, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund murmured of her gladness that he should be able to enjoy them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oddly enough, he is not an eater of meat,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A vegetarian!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg you not to mention the fact to my lord. You see, you yourself can
      scarcely pardon it. He does not exclude flesh from his table. Blackburn
      Tuckham dined there once. &ldquo;You are a thorough revolutionist, Dr.
      Shrapnel,&rdquo; he observed. The doctor does not exclude wine, but he does not
      drink it. Poor Tuckham went away entirely opposed to a Radical he could
      not even meet as a boon-fellow. I begged him not to mention the
      circumstances, as I have begged you. He pledged me his word to that effect
      solemnly; he correctly felt that if the truth were known, there would be
      further cause for the reprobation of the man who had been his host.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that poor girl, Nevil?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Denham? She contracted the habit of eating meat at school, and
      drinking wine in Paris, and continues it, occasionally. Now run upstairs.
      Insist on food. Inform Madame de Rouaillout that her brother M. le comte
      de Croisnel will soon be here, and should not find her ill. Talk to her as
      you women can talk. Keep the blinds down in her room; light a dozen
      wax-candles. Tell her I have no thought but of her. It&rsquo;s a lie: of no
      woman but of her: that you may say. But that you can&rsquo;t say. You can say I
      am devoted&mdash;ha, what stuff! I&rsquo;ve only to open my mouth!&mdash;say
      nothing of me: let her think the worst&mdash;unless it comes to a question
      of her life: then be a merciful good woman...&rsquo; He squeezed her fingers,
      communicating his muscular tremble to her sensitive woman&rsquo;s frame, and
      electrically convincing her that he was a lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went up-stairs. In ten minutes she descended, and found him pacing up
      and down the hall. &lsquo;Madame de Rouaillout is much the same,&rsquo; she said. He
      nodded, looked up the stairs, and about for his hat and gloves, drew on
      the gloves, fixed the buttons, blinked at his watch, and settled his hat
      as he was accustomed to wear it, all very methodically, and talking
      rapidly, but except for certain precise directions, which were not needed
      by so careful a housekeeper and nurse as Rosamund was known to be, she
      could not catch a word of meaning. He had some appointment, it seemed;
      perhaps he was off for a doctor&mdash;a fresh instance of his masculine
      incapacity to understand patient endurance. After opening the housedoor,
      and returning to the foot of the stairs, listening and sighing, he
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      It struck her that he was trying to be two men at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The litter of newspaper sheets in the morning-room brought his exclamation
      to her mind: &lsquo;They&rsquo;re at me!&rsquo; Her eyes ran down the columns, and were
      seized by the print of his name in large type. A leading article was
      devoted to Commander&rsquo;s Beauchamp&rsquo;s recent speech delivered in the great
      manufacturing town of Gunningham, at a meeting under the presidency of the
      mayor, and his replies to particular questions addressed to him; one
      being, what right did he conceive himself to have to wear the Sovereign&rsquo;s
      uniform in professing Republican opinions? Rosamund winced for her darling
      during her first perusal of the article. It was of the sarcastically
      caressing kind, masterly in ease of style, as the flourish of the
      executioner well may be with poor Bare-back hung up to a leisurely
      administration of the scourge. An allusion to &lsquo;Jack on shore&rsquo; almost
      persuaded her that his uncle Everard had inspired the writer of the
      article. Beauchamp&rsquo;s reply to the question of his loyalty was not quoted:
      he was, however, complimented on his frankness. At the same time he was
      assured that his error lay in a too great proneness to make distinctions,
      and that there was no distinction between sovereign and country in a loyal
      and contented land, which could thank him for gallant services in war,
      while taking him for the solitary example to be cited at the present
      period of the evils of a comparatively long peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Doubtless the tedium of such a state to a man of the temperament of the
      gallant commander,&rsquo; etc., the termination of the article was indulgent.
      Rosamund recurred to the final paragraph for comfort, and though she loved
      Beauchamp, the test of her representative feminine sentiment regarding his
      political career, when personal feeling on his behalf had subsided, was,
      that the writer of the article must have received an intimation to deal
      both smartly and forbearingly with the offender: and from whom but her
      lord? Her notions of the conduct of the Press were primitive. In a summary
      of the article Beauchamp was treated as naughty boy, formerly brave boy,
      and likely by-and-by to be good boy. Her secret heart would have spoken
      similarly, with more emphasis on the flattering terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      A telegram arrived from her lord. She was bidden to have the house clear
      for him by noon of the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      How could that be done?
    </p>
    <p>
      But to write blankly to inform the Earl of Romfrey that he was excluded
      from his own house was another impossibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hateful man!&rsquo; she apostrophized Captain Baskelett, and sat down,
      supporting her chin in a prolonged meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The card of a French lady, bearing the name of Madame d&rsquo;Auffray, was
      handed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp had gone off to his friend Lydiard, to fortify himself in his
      resolve to reply to that newspaper article by eliciting counsel to the
      contrary. Phrase by phrase he fought through the first half of his
      composition of the reply against Lydiard, yielding to him on a point or
      two of literary judgement, only the more vehemently to maintain his ideas
      of discretion, which were, that he would not take shelter behind a single
      subterfuge; that he would try this question nakedly, though he should
      stand alone; that he would stake his position on it, and establish his
      right to speak his opinions: and as for unseasonable times, he protested
      it was the cry of a gorged middle-class, frightened of further action, and
      making snug with compromise. Would it be a seasonable time when there was
      uproar? Then it would be a time to be silent on such themes: they could be
      discussed calmly now, and without danger; and whether he was hunted or
      not, he cared nothing. He declined to consider the peculiar nature of
      Englishmen: they must hear truth or perish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing the difficulty once afflicting Beauchamp in the art of speaking on
      politics tersely, Lydiard was rather astonished at his well-delivered
      cannonade; and he fancied that his modesty had been displaced by the new
      acquirement; not knowing the nervous fever of his friend&rsquo;s condition, for
      which the rattle of speech was balm, and contention a native element, and
      the assumption of truth a necessity. Beauchamp hugged his politics like
      some who show their love of the pleasures of life by taking to them
      angrily. It was all he had: he had given up all for it. He forced Lydiard
      to lay down his pen and walk back to the square with him, and went on
      arguing, interjecting, sneering, thumping the old country, raising and
      oversetting her, treating her alternately like a disrespected grandmother,
      and like a woman anciently beloved; as a dead lump, and as a garden of
      seeds; reviewing prominent political men, laughing at the dwarf-giants;
      finally casting anchor on a Mechanics&rsquo; Institute that he had recently
      heard of, where working men met weekly for the purpose of reading the
      British poets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the best thing I&rsquo;ve heard of late,&rsquo; he said, shaking Lydiard&rsquo;s
      hand on the door-steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! You&rsquo;re Commander Beauchamp; I think I know you. I&rsquo;ve seen you on a
      platform,&rsquo; cried a fresh-faced man in decent clothes, halting on his way
      along the pavement; &lsquo;and if you were in your uniform, you damned
      Republican dog! I&rsquo;d strip you with my own hands, for the disloyal
      scoundrel you are, with your pimping Republicanism and capsizing
      everything in a country like Old England. It&rsquo;s the cat-o&rsquo;-nine-tails you
      want, and the bosen to lay on; and I&rsquo;d do it myself. And mind me, when
      next I catch sight of you in blue and gold lace, I&rsquo;ll compel you to show
      cause why you wear it, and prove your case, or else I&rsquo;ll make a Cupid of
      you, and no joke about it. I don&rsquo;t pay money for a nincompoop to outrage
      my feelings of respect and loyalty, when he&rsquo;s in my pay, d&rsquo; ye hear?
      You&rsquo;re in my pay: and you do your duty, or I &lsquo;ll kick ye out of it. It&rsquo;s
      no empty threat. You look out for your next public speech, if it&rsquo;s
      anywhere within forty mile of London. Get along.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With a scowl, and a very ugly &lsquo;yah!&rsquo; worthy of cannibal jaws, the man
      passed off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp kept eye on him. &lsquo;What class does a fellow like that come of?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a harmless enthusiast,&rsquo; said Lydiard. &lsquo;He has been reading the
      article, and has got excited over it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I had the fellow&rsquo;s address.&rsquo; Beauchamp looked wistfully at
      Lydiard, but he did not stimulate the generous offer to obtain it for him.
      Perhaps it was as well to forget the fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see the effect of those articles,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see what I mean by unseasonable times,&rsquo; Lydiard retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t talk like a tradesman,&rsquo; Beauchamp mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He may be one, for all that. It&rsquo;s better to class him as an enthusiast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An enthusiast!&rsquo; Beauchamp stamped: &lsquo;for what?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For the existing order of things; for his beef and ale; for the titles he
      is accustomed to read in the papers. You don&rsquo;t study your countrymen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d study that fellow, if I had the chance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would probably find him one of the emptiest, with a rather worse
      temper than most of them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp shook Lydiard&rsquo;s hand, saying, &lsquo;The widow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no woman like her!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, now you&rsquo;re free&mdash;why not? I think I put one man out of the
      field.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too early! Besides&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Repeat that, and you may have to say too late.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When shall you go down to Bevisham?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When? I can&rsquo;t tell: when I&rsquo;ve gone through fire. There never was a home
      for me like the cottage, and the old man, and the dear good girl&mdash;the
      best of girls! if you hadn&rsquo;t a little spoilt her with your philosophy of
      the two sides of the case.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve not given her the brains.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s always doubtful of doing, doubtful of action: she has no will. So
      she is fatalistic, and an argument between us ends in her submitting, as
      if she must submit to me, because I&rsquo;m overbearing, instead of accepting
      the fact.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She feels your influence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s against the publication of THE DAWN&mdash;for the present. It&rsquo;s an
      &ldquo;unseasonable time.&rdquo; I argue with her: I don&rsquo;t get hold of her mind a bit;
      but at last she says, &ldquo;very well.&rdquo; She has your head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And you have her heart, Lydiard could have rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      They said good-bye, neither of them aware of the other&rsquo;s task of
      endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were parting, Beauchamp perceived his old comrade Jack Wilmore
      walking past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jack!&rsquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilmore glanced round. &lsquo;How do you do, Beauchamp?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are you off to, Jack?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Down to the Admiralty. I&rsquo;m rather in a hurry; I have an appointment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you stop just a minute?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t. Good morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was incredible; but this old friend, the simplest heart alive,
      retreated without a touch of his hand, and with a sorely wounded air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That newspaper article appears to have been generally read,&rsquo; Beauchamp
      said to Lydiard, who answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The article did not put the idea of you into men&rsquo;s minds, but gave tongue
      to it: you may take it for an instance of the sagacity of the Press.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t take that man and me to have been messmates for years! Old
      Jack Wilmore! Don&rsquo;t go, Lydiard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydiard declared that he was bound to go: he was engaged to read Italian
      for an hour with Mrs. Wardour-Devereux.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then go, by all means,&rsquo; Beauchamp dismissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt as if he had held a review of his friends and enemies on the
      door-step, and found them of one colour. If it was an accident befalling
      him in a London square during a space of a quarter of an hour, what of the
      sentiments of universal England? Lady Barbara&rsquo;s elopement with Lord Alfred
      last year did not rouse much execration; hardly worse than gossip and
      compassion. Beauchamp drank a great deal of bitterness from his
      reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      They who provoke huge battles, and gain but lame victories over
      themselves, insensibly harden to the habit of distilling sour thoughts
      from their mischances and from most occurrences. So does the world they
      combat win on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For,&rsquo; says Dr. Shrapnel, &lsquo;the world and nature, which are opposed in
      relation to our vital interests, each agrees to demand of us a perfect
      victory, on pain otherwise of proving it a stage performance; and the
      victory over the world, as over nature, is over self: and this victory
      lies in yielding perpetual service to the world, and none to nature: for
      the world has to be wrought out, nature to be subdued.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior of the house was like a change of elements to Beauchamp. He
      had never before said to himself, &lsquo;I have done my best, and I am beaten!&rsquo; 
      Outside of it, his native pugnacity had been stimulated; but here, within
      the walls where Renee lay silently breathing, barely breathing, it might
      be dying, he was overcome, and left it to circumstance to carry him to a
      conclusion. He went up-stairs to the drawing-room, where he beheld Madame
      d&rsquo;Auffray in conversation with Rosamund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was assured by Madame la Comtesse that I should see you to-day,&rsquo; the
      French lady said as she swam to meet him; &lsquo;it is a real pleasure&rsquo;: and
      pressing his hand she continued, &lsquo;but I fear you will be disappointed of
      seeing my sister. She would rashly try your climate at its worst period.
      Believe me, I do not join in decrying it, except on her account: I could
      have forewarned her of an English Winter and early Spring. You know her
      impetuosity; suddenly she decided on accepting the invitation of Madame la
      Comtesse; and though I have no fears of her health, she is at present a
      victim of the inclement weather.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have seen her, madame?&rsquo; said Beauchamp. So well had the clever lady
      played the dupe that he forgot there was a part for him to play. Even the
      acquiescence of Rosamund in the title of countess bewildered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madame d&rsquo;Auffray has been sitting for an hour with Madame de Rouaillout,&rsquo; 
      said Rosamund.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke of Roland&rsquo;s coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah?&rsquo; said Madame d&rsquo;Auffray, and turned to Rosamund: &lsquo;you have determined
      to surprise us: then you will have a gathering of the whole family in your
      hospitable house, Madame la Comtesse!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If M. la Marquis will do it that honour, madame!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My brother is in London,&rsquo; Madame d&rsquo;Auffray said to Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shattering blow was merited by one who could not rejoice that he had
      acted rightly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII. THE EARL OF ROMFREY AND THE COUNTESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      An extraordinary telegraphic message, followed by a still more
      extraordinary letter the next morning, from Rosamund Culling, all but
      interdicted the immediate occupation of his house in town to Everard, now
      Earl of Romfrey. She begged him briefly not to come until after the
      funeral, and proposed to give him good reasons for her request at their
      meeting. &lsquo;I repeat, I pledge myself to satisfy you on this point,&rsquo; she
      wrote. Her tone was that of one of your heroic women of history refusing
      to surrender a fortress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everard&rsquo;s wrath was ever of a complexion that could suffer postponements
      without his having to fear an abatement of it. He had no business to
      transact in London, and he had much at the Castle, so he yielded himself
      up to his new sensations, which are not commonly the portion of gentlemen
      of his years. He anticipated that Nevil would at least come down to the
      funeral, but there was no appearance of him, nor a word to excuse his
      absence. Cecil was his only supporter. They walked together between the
      double ranks of bare polls of the tenantry and peasantry, resembling in a
      fashion old Froissart engravings the earl used to dote on in his boyhood,
      representing bodies of manacled citizens, whose humbled heads looked like
      nuts to be cracked, outside the gates of captured French towns, awaiting
      the disposition of their conqueror, with his banner above him and prancing
      knights around. That was a glory of the past. He had no successor. The
      thought was chilling; the solitariness of childlessness to an aged man,
      chief of a most ancient and martial House, and proud of his blood, gave
      him the statue&rsquo;s outlook on a desert, and made him feel that he was no
      more than a whirl of the dust, settling to the dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened to the parson curiously and consentingly. We are ashes. Ten
      centuries had come to an end in him to prove the formula correct. The
      chronicle of the House would state that the last Earl of Romfrey left no
      heir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecil was a fine figure walking beside him. Measured by feet, he might be
      a worthy holder of great lands. But so heartily did the earl despise this
      nephew that he never thought of trying strength with the fellow, and
      hardly cared to know what his value was, beyond his immediate uses as an
      instrument to strike with. Beauchamp of Romfrey had been his dream, not
      Baskelett: and it increased his disgust of Beauchamp that Baskelett should
      step forward as the man. No doubt Cecil would hunt the county famously: he
      would preserve game with the sleepless eye of a General of the Jesuits.
      These things were to be considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days after the funeral Lord Romfrey proceeded to London. He was met at
      the station by Rosamund, and informed that his house was not yet vacated
      by the French family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And where have you arranged for me to go, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; he asked her
      complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She named an hotel where she had taken rooms for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, and was driven to the hotel, saying little on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she expected, he was heavily armed against her and Nevil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re the slave of the fellow, ma&rsquo;am. You are so infatuated that you
      second his amours, in my house. I must wait for a clearance, it seems.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He cast a comical glance of disapprobation on the fittings of the hotel
      apartment, abhorring gilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They leave us the day after to-morrow,&rsquo; said Rosamund, out of breath with
      nervousness at the commencement of the fray, and skipping over the opening
      ground of a bold statement of facts. &lsquo;Madame de Rouaillout has been
      unwell. She is not yet recovered; she has just risen. Her sister-in-law
      has nursed her. Her husband seems much broken in health; he is perfect on
      the points of courtesy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is lucky, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her brother, Nevil&rsquo;s comrade in the war, was there also.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who came first?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My lord, you have only heard Captain Baskelett&rsquo;s version of the story.
      She has been my guest since the first day of her landing in England. There
      cannot possibly be an imputation on her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ma&rsquo;am, if her husband manages to be satisfied, what on earth have I to do
      with it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am thinking of Nevil, my lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re never thinking of any one else, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He sleeps here, at this hotel. He left the house to Madame de Rouaillout.
      I bear witness to that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You two seem to have made your preparations to stand a criminal trial.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is pure truth, my lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you take me to be anxious about the fellow&rsquo;s virtue?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is a lady who would please you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A scandal in my house does not please me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The only approach to a scandal was made by Captain Baskelett.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A poor devil locked out of his bed on a Winter&rsquo;s night hullabaloos with
      pretty good reason. I suppose he felt the contrast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My lord, this lady did me the honour to come to me on a visit. I have not
      previously presumed to entertain a friend. She probably formed no estimate
      of my exact position.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl with a gesture implied Rosamund&rsquo;s privilege to act the hostess to
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You invited her?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is, I had told her I hoped she would come to England.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She expected you to be at the house in town on her arrival?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was her impulse to come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She came alone?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She may have desired to be away from her own people for a time: there may
      have been domestic differences. These cases are delicate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This case appears to have been so delicate that you had to lock out a
      fourth party.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is indelicate and base of Captain Baskelett to complain and to hint.
      Nevil had to submit to the same; and Captain Baskelett took his revenge on
      the housedoor and the bells. The house was visited by the police next
      morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you suspect him to have known you were inside the house that night?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not say so: but hatred of Cecil urged her past the bounds of
      habitual reticence to put it to her lord whether he, imagining the worst,
      would have behaved like Cecil.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this he did not reply, but remarked, &lsquo;I am sorry he annoyed you,
      ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not the annoyance to me; it is the shocking, the unmanly insolence
      to a lady, and a foreign lady.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a matter between him and Nevil. I uphold him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, my lord, I am silent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Silent she remained; but Lord Romfrey was also silent: and silence being a
      weapon of offence only when it is practised by one out of two, she had to
      reflect whether in speaking no further she had finished her business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Captain Baskelett stays at the Castle?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He likes his quarters there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil could not go down to Romfrey, my lord. He was obliged to wait, and
      see, and help me to entertain, her brother and her husband.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am? But I have no objection to his making the marquis a happy
      husband.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has done what few men would have done, that she may be a
      self-respecting wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The parson&rsquo;s in that fellow!&rsquo; Lord Romfrey exclaimed. &lsquo;Now I have the
      story. She came to him, he declined the gift, and you were turned into the
      curtain for them. If he had only been off with her, he would have done the
      country good service. Here he&rsquo;s a failure and a nuisance; he&rsquo;s a common
      cock-shy for the journals. I&rsquo;m tired of hearing of him; he&rsquo;s a stench in
      our nostrils. He&rsquo;s tired of the woman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He loves her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ma&rsquo;am, you&rsquo;re hoodwinked. If he refused to have her, there &lsquo;s a something
      he loves better. I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;ve bred a downright lackadaisical
      donkey in our family: I know him. He&rsquo;s not a fellow for abstract morality:
      I know him. It&rsquo;s bargain against bargain with him; I&rsquo;ll do him that
      justice. I hear he has ordered the removal of the Jersey bull from
      Holdesbury, and the beast is mine,&rsquo; Lord Romfrey concluded in a lower key.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil has taken him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! pull and pull, then!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He contends that he is bound by a promise to give an American gentleman
      the refusal of the bull, and you must sign an engagement to keep the
      animal no longer than two years.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I sign no engagement. I stick to the bull.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Consent to see Nevil to-night, my lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When he has apologized to you, I may, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely he did more, in requesting me to render him a service.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s not a creature living that fellow wouldn&rsquo;t get to serve him, if
      he knew the trick. We should all of us be marching on London at Shrapnel&rsquo;s
      heels. The political mania is just as incurable as hydrophobia, and he&rsquo;s
      bitten. That&rsquo;s clear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bitten perhaps: but not mad. As you have always contended, the true case
      is incurable, but it is very rare: and is this one?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s uncommonly like a true case, though I haven&rsquo;t seen him foam at the
      mouth, and shun water-as his mob does.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund restrained some tears, betraying the effort to hide the moisture.
      &lsquo;I am no match for you, my lord. I try to plead on his behalf;&mdash;I do
      worse than if I were dumb. This I most earnestly say: he is the Nevil
      Beauchamp who fought for his country, and did not abandon her cause,
      though he stood there&mdash;we had it from Colonel Halkett&mdash;a
      skeleton: and he is the Nevil who&mdash;I am poorly paying my debt to him!&mdash;defended
      me from the aspersions of his cousin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Boys!&rsquo; Lord Romfrey ejaculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the same dispute between them as men.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you forgotten my proposal to shield you from liars and
      scandalmongers?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Could I ever forget it?&rsquo; Rosamund appeared to come shining out of a
      cloud. &lsquo;Princeliest and truest gentleman, I thought you then, and I know
      you to be, my dear lord. I fancied I had lived the scandal down. I was
      under the delusion that I had grown to be past backbiting: and that no man
      could stand before me to insult and vilify me. But, for a woman in any
      so-called doubtful position, it seems that the coward will not be wanting
      to strike her. In quitting your service, I am able to affirm that only
      once during the whole term of it have I consciously overstepped the line
      of my duties: it was for Nevil: and Captain Baskelett undertook to defend
      your reputation, in consequence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has the rascal been questioning your conduct?&rsquo; The earl frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no! not questioning: he does not question, he accuses: he never
      doubted: and what he went shouting as a boy, is plain matter of fact to
      him now. He is devoted to you. It was for your sake that he desired me to
      keep my name from being mixed up in a scandal he foresaw the occurrence of
      in your house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He permitted himself to sneer at you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has the art of sneering. On this occasion he wished to be direct and
      personal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What sort of hints were they?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey strode away from her chair that the answer might be easy to
      her, for she was red, and evidently suffering from shame as well as
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The hints we call distinct.&rsquo; said Rosamund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In words?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In hard words.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you won&rsquo;t meet Cecil?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a question, and the tone of indifference in which it came, surprised
      and revolted her so that the unreflecting reply leapt out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would rather meet a devil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Of how tremblingly, vehemently, and hastily she had said it, she was
      unaware. To her lord it was an outcry of nature, astutely touched by him
      to put her to proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued his long leisurely strides, nodding over his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund stood up. She looked a very noble figure in her broad
      black-furred robe. &lsquo;I have one serious confession to make, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would avoid it, for it cannot lead to particular harm; but I have an
      enemy who may poison your ear in my absence. And first I resign my
      position. I have forfeited it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Time goes forward, ma&rsquo;am, and you go round. Speak to the point. Do you
      mean that you toss up the reins of my household?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do. You trace it to Nevil immediately?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do. The fellow wants to upset the country, and he begins with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are wrong, my lord. What I have done places me at Captain Baskelett&rsquo;s
      mercy. It is too loathsome to think of: worse than the whip; worse than
      your displeasure. It might never be known; but the thought that it might
      gives me courage. You have said that to protect a woman everything is
      permissible. It is your creed, my lord, and because the world, I have
      heard you say, is unjust and implacable to women. In some cases, I think
      so too. In reality I followed your instructions; I mean, your example.
      Cheap chivalry on my part! But it pained me not a little. I beg to urge
      that in my defence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, you have tied the knot tight enough; perhaps now you&rsquo;ll cut
      it,&rsquo; said the earl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund gasped softly. &lsquo;M. le Marquis is a gentleman who, after a life of
      dissipation, has been reminded by bad health that he has a young and
      beautiful wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He dug his pit to fall into it:&mdash;he&rsquo;s jealous?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head to indicate the immeasurable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Senile jealousy is anxious to be deceived. He could hardly be deceived so
      far as to imagine that Madame la Marquise would visit me, such as I am, as
      my guest. Knowingly or not, his very clever sister, a good woman, and a
      friend to husband and wife&mdash;a Frenchwoman of the purest type&mdash;gave
      me the title. She insisted on it, and I presumed to guess that she deemed
      it necessary for the sake of peace in that home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey appeared merely inquisitive; his eyebrows were lifted in
      permanence; his eyes were mild.
    </p>
    <p>
      She continued: &lsquo;They leave England in a few hours. They are not likely to
      return. I permitted him to address me with the title of countess.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of Romfrey?&rsquo; said the earl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mouth contracted. She did not expect thunder to issue from it, but she
      did fear to hear a sarcasm, or that she would have to endure a deadly
      silence: and she was gathering her own lips in imitation of his, to nerve
      herself for some stroke to come, when he laughed in his peculiar
      close-mouthed manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve dished yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You cannot forgive me, my lord?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He indulged in more of his laughter, and abruptly summoning gravity, bade
      her talk to him of affairs. He himself talked of the condition of the
      Castle, and with a certain off-hand contempt of the ladies of the family,
      and Cecil&rsquo;s father, Sir John. &lsquo;What are they to me?&rsquo; said he, and he
      complained of having been called Last Earl of Romfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The line ends undegenerate,&rsquo; said Rosamund fervidly, though she knew not
      where she stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ends!&rsquo; quoth the earl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must see Stukely,&rsquo; he added briskly, and stooped to her: &lsquo;I beg you to
      drive me to my Club, countess.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Once a countess, always a countess!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But once an impostor, my lord?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not always, we&rsquo;ll hope.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He enjoyed this little variation in the language of comedy; letting it
      drop, to say: &lsquo;Be here to-morrow early. Don&rsquo;t chase that family away from
      the house. Do as you will, but not a word of Nevil to me: he&rsquo;s a bad mess
      in any man&rsquo;s porringer; it&rsquo;s time for me to claim exemption of him from
      mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She dared not let her thoughts flow, for to think was to triumph, and
      possibly to be deluded. They came in copious volumes when Lord Romfrey,
      alighting at his Club, called to the coachman: &lsquo;Drive the countess home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not thoughts of triumph absolutely. In her cooler mind she felt
      that it was a bad finish of a gallant battle. Few women had risen against
      a tattling and pelting world so stedfastly; and would it not have been
      better to keep her own ground, which she had won with tears and some
      natural strength, and therewith her liberty, which she prized? The hateful
      Cecil, a reminder of whom set her cheeks burning and turned her heart to
      serpent, had forced her to it. So she honestly conceived, owing to the
      circumstance of her honestly disliking the pomps of life and not desiring
      to occupy any position of brilliancy. She thought assuredly of her hoard
      of animosity toward the scandalmongers, and of the quiet glance she would
      cast behind on them, and below. That thought came as a fruit, not as a
      reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if ever two offending young gentlemen, nephews of a long-suffering
      uncle, were circumvented, undermined, and struck to earth, with one blow,
      here was the instance. This was accomplished by Lord Romfrey&rsquo;s resolution
      to make the lady he had learnt to esteem his countess: and more, it fixed
      to him for life one whom he could not bear to think of losing: and still
      more, it might be; but what more was unwritten on his tablets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund failed to recollect that Everard Romfrey never took a step
      without seeing a combination of objects to be gained by it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIV. THE NEPHEWS OF THE EARL, AND ANOTHER EXHIBITION OF THE TWO
    </h2>
    <p>
      PASSIONS IN BEAUCHAMP
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now the season when London is as a lighted tower to her provinces,
      and, among other gentlemen hurried thither by attraction, Captain
      Baskelett arrived. Although not a personage in the House of Commons, he
      was a vote; and if he never committed himself to the perils of a speech,
      he made himself heard. His was the part of chorus, which he performed with
      a fairly close imitation of the original cries of periods before
      parliaments were instituted, thus representing a stage in the human
      development besides the borough of Bevisham. He arrived in the best of
      moods for the emission of high-pitched vowel-sounds; otherwise in the
      worst of tempers. His uncle had notified an addition of his income to him
      at Romfrey, together with commands that he should quit the castle
      instantly: and there did that woman, Mistress Culling, do the honours to
      Nevil Beauchamp&rsquo;s French party. He assured Lord Palmet of his positive
      knowledge of the fact, incredible as the sanction of such immoral
      proceedings by the Earl of Romfrey must appear to that young nobleman.
      Additions to income are of course acceptable, but in the form of a
      palpable stipulation for silence, they neither awaken gratitude nor effect
      their purpose. Quite the contrary; they prick the moral mind to sit in
      judgement on the donor. It means, she fears me! Cecil confidently thought
      and said of the intriguing woman who managed his patron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town-house was open to him. Lord Romfrey was at Steynham. Cecil could
      not suppose that he was falling into a pit in entering it. He happened to
      be the favourite of the old housekeeper, who liked him for his
      haughtiness, which was to her thinking the sign of real English nobility,
      and perhaps it is the popular sign, and a tonic to the people. She raised
      lamentations over the shame of the locking of the door against him that
      awful night, declaring she had almost mustered courage to go down to him
      herself, in spite of Mrs. Calling&rsquo;s orders. The old woman lowered her
      voice to tell him that her official superior had permitted the French
      gentleman and ladies to call her countess. This she knew for a certainty,
      though she knew nothing of French; but the French lady who came second
      brought a maid who knew English a little, and she said the very words&mdash;the
      countess, and said also that her party took Mrs. Culling for the Countess
      of Romfrey. What was more, my lord&rsquo;s coachman caught it up, and he called
      her countess, and he had a quarrel about it with the footman Kendall; and
      the day after a dreadful affair between them in the mews, home drives
      madam, and Kendall is to go up to her, and down the poor man comes, and
      not a word to be got out of him, but as if he had seen a ghost. &lsquo;She have
      such power,&rsquo; Cecil&rsquo;s admirer concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wager I match her,&rsquo; Cecil said to himself, pulling at his wristbands
      and letting his lower teeth shine out. The means of matching her were not
      so palpable as the resolution. First he took men into his confidence. Then
      he touched lightly on the story to ladies, with the question, &lsquo;What ought
      I to do?&rsquo; In consideration for the Earl of Romfrey he ought not to pass it
      over, he suggested. The ladies of the family urged him to go to Steynham
      and boldly confront the woman. He was not prepared for that. Better, it
      seemed to him, to blow the rumour, and make it the topic of the season,
      until Lord Romfrey should hear of it. Cecil had the ear of the town for a
      month. He was in the act of slicing the air with his right hand in his
      accustomed style, one evening at Lady Elsea&rsquo;s, to protest how vast was the
      dishonour done to the family by Mistress Culling, when Stukely Culbrett
      stopped him, saying, &lsquo;The lady you speak of is the Countess of Romfrey. I
      was present at the marriage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecil received the shock in the attitude of those martial figures we see
      wielding two wooden swords in provincial gardens to tell the disposition
      of the wind: abruptly abandoned by it, they stand transfixed, one sword
      aloft, the other at their heels. The resemblance extended to his
      astonished countenance. His big chest heaved. Like many another wounded
      giant before him, he experienced the insufficiency of interjections to
      solace pain. For them, however, the rocks were handy to fling, the trees
      to uproot; heaven&rsquo;s concave resounded companionably to their bellowings.
      Relief of so concrete a kind is not to be obtained in crowded London
      assemblies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are jesting?&mdash;you are a jester,&rsquo; he contrived to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was a private marriage, and I was a witness,&rsquo; replied Stukely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord Romfrey has made an honest woman of her, has he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A peeress, you mean.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecil bowed. &lsquo;Exactly. I am corrected. I mean a peeress.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He got out of the room with as high an air as he could command, feeling as
      if a bar of iron had flattened his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day it was intimated to him by one of the Steynham servants that
      apartments were ready for him at the residence of the late earl: Lord
      Romfrey&rsquo;s house was about to be occupied by the Countess of Romfrey. Cecil
      had to quit, and he chose to be enamoured of that dignity of sulking so
      seductive to the wounded spirit of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund, Countess of Romfrey, had worse to endure from Beauchamp. He
      indeed came to the house, and he went through the formalities of
      congratulation, but his opinion of her step was unconcealed, that she had
      taken it for the title. He distressed her by reviving the case of Dr.
      Shrapnel, as though it were a matter of yesterday, telling her she had
      married a man with a stain on him; she should have exacted the Apology as
      a nuptial present; ay, and she would have done it if she had cared for the
      earl&rsquo;s honour or her own. So little did he understand men! so tenacious
      was he of his ideas! She had almost forgotten the case of Dr. Shrapnel,
      and to see it shooting up again in the new path of her life was really
      irritating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund did not defend herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very glad you have come, Nevil,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;your uncle holds to the
      ceremony. I may be of real use to you now; I wish to be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have only to prove it,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;If you can turn his mind to
      marriage, you can send him to Bevisham.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My chief thought is to serve you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it is, I know it is,&rsquo; he rejoined with some fervour. &lsquo;You have
      served me, and made me miserable for life, and rightly. Never mind, all&rsquo;s
      well while the hand&rsquo;s to the axe.&rsquo; Beauchamp smoothed his forehead
      roughly, trying hard to inspire himself with the tonic draughts of
      sentiments cast in the form of proverbs. &lsquo;Lord Romfrey saw her, you say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He did, Nevil, and admired her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, if I suffer, let me think of her! For courage and nobleness I shall
      never find her equal. Have you changed your ideas of Frenchwomen now? Not
      a word, you say, not a look, to show her disdain of me whenever my name
      was mentioned!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She could scarcely feel disdain. She was guilty of a sad error.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Through trusting in me. Will nothing teach you where the fault lies? You
      women have no mercy for women. She went through the parade to Romfrey
      Castle and back, and she must have been perishing at heart. That, you
      English call acting. In history you have a respect for such acting up to
      the scaffold. Good-bye to her! There&rsquo;s a story ended. One thing you must
      promise: you&rsquo;re a peeress, ma&rsquo;am: the story&rsquo;s out, everybody has heard of
      it; that babbler has done his worst: if you have a becoming appreciation
      of your title, you will promise me honestly&mdash;no, give me your word as
      a woman I can esteem&mdash;that you will not run about excusing me.
      Whatever you hear said or suggested, say nothing yourself. I insist on
      your keeping silence. Press my hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil, how foolish!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is unreasonable. You give your enemies licence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know what&rsquo;s in your head. Take my hand, and let me have your word for
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if persons you like very much, Nevil, should hear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Promise. You are a woman not to break your word.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I decline?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your hand! I&rsquo;ll kiss it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! my darling.&rsquo; Rosamund flung her arms round him and strained him an
      instant to her bosom. &lsquo;What have I but you in the world? My comfort was
      the hope that I might serve you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes! by slaying one woman as an offering to another. It would be
      impossible for you to speak the truth. Don&rsquo;t you see, it would be a lie
      against her, and making a figure of me that a man would rather drop to the
      ground than have shown of him? I was to blame, and only I. Madame de
      Rouaillout was as utterly deceived by me as ever a trusting woman by a
      brute. I look at myself and hardly believe it &lsquo;s the same man. I wrote to
      her that I was unchanged&mdash;and I was entirely changed, another
      creature, anything Lord Romfrey may please to call me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Nevil, I repeat, if Miss Halkett should hear...?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She knows by this time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At present she is ignorant of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what is Miss Halkett to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More than you imagined in that struggle you underwent, I think, Nevil.
      Oh! if only to save her from Captain Baskelett! He gained your uncle&rsquo;s
      consent when they were at the Castle, to support him in proposing for her.
      He is persistent. Women have been snared without loving. She is a great
      heiress. Reflect on his use of her wealth. You respect her, if you have no
      warmer feeling. Let me assure you that the husband of Cecilia, if he is of
      Romfrey blood, has the fairest chance of the estates. That man will employ
      every weapon. He will soon be here bowing to me to turn me to his
      purposes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cecilia can see through Baskelett,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Single-mindedly selfish men may be seen through and through, and still be
      dangerous, Nevil. The supposition is, that we know the worst of them. He
      carries a story to poison her mind. She could resist it, if you and she
      were in full confidence together. If she did not love you, she could
      resist it. She does, and for some strange reason beyond my capacity to
      fathom, you have not come to an understanding. Sanction my speaking to
      her, just to put her on her guard, privately: not to injure that poor
      lady, but to explain. Shall she not know the truth? I need say but very
      little. Indeed, all I can say is, that finding the marquise in London one
      evening, you telegraphed for me to attend on her, and I joined you. You
      shake your head. But surely it is due to Miss Halkett. She should be
      protected from what will certainly wound her deeply. Her father is afraid
      of you, on the score of your theories. I foresee it: he will hear the
      scandal: he will imagine you as bad in morals as in politics. And you have
      lost your friend in Lord Romfrey&mdash;though he shall not be your enemy.
      Colonel Halkett and Cecilia called on us at Steynham. She was looking
      beautiful; a trifle melancholy. The talk was of your&mdash;that&mdash;I do
      not like it, but you hold those opinions&mdash;the Republicanism. She had
      read your published letters. She spoke to me of your sincerity. Colonel
      Halkett of course was vexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the same with all your friends. She, however, by her tone, led me to
      think that she sees you as you are, more than in what you do. They are now
      in Wales. They will be in town after Easter. Then you must expect that her
      feeling for you will be tried, unless but you will! You will let me speak
      to her, Nevil. My position allows me certain liberties I was previously
      debarred from. You have not been so very tender to your Cecilia that you
      can afford to give her fresh reasons for sorrowful perplexity. And why
      should you stand to be blackened by scandalmongers when a few words of
      mine will prove that instead of weak you have been strong, instead of
      libertine blameless? I am not using fine phrases: I would not. I would be
      as thoughtful of you as if you were present. And for her sake, I repeat,
      the truth should be told to her. I have a lock of her hair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cecilia&rsquo;s? Where?&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is at Steynham.&rsquo; Rosamund primmed her lips at the success of her
      probing touch; but she was unaware of the chief reason for his doting on
      those fair locks, and how they coloured his imagination since the day of
      the drive into Bevisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now leave me, my dear Nevil,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Lord Romfrey will soon be here,
      and it is as well for the moment that you should not meet him, if it can
      be avoided.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp left her, like a man out-argued and overcome. He had no wish to
      meet his uncle, whose behaviour in contracting a misalliance and casting a
      shadow on the family, in a manner so perfectly objectless and senseless,
      appeared to him to call for the reverse of compliments. Cecilia&rsquo;s lock of
      hair lying at Steynham hung in his mind. He saw the smooth flat curl lying
      secret like a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The graceful head it had fallen from was dimmer in his mental eye. He went
      so far in this charmed meditation as to feel envy of the possessor of the
      severed lock: passingly he wondered, with the wonder of reproach, that the
      possessor should deem it enough to possess the lock, and resign it to a
      drawer or a desk. And as when life rolls back on us after the long ebb of
      illness, little whispers and diminutive images of the old joys and prizes
      of life arrest and fill our hearts; or as, to men who have been beaten
      down by storms, the opening of a daisy is dearer than the blazing orient
      which bids it open; so the visionary lock of Cecilia&rsquo;s hair became
      Cecilia&rsquo;s self to Beauchamp, yielding him as much of her as he could bear
      to think of, for his heart was shattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why had she given it to his warmest friend? For the asking, probably.
    </p>
    <p>
      This question was the first ripple of the breeze from other emotions
      beginning to flow fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked out of London, to be alone, and to think and from the palings of
      a road on a South-western run of high land, he gazed, at the great city&mdash;a
      place conquerable yet, with the proper appliances for subjugating it: the
      starting of his daily newspaper, THE DAWN, say, as a commencement. It
      began to seem a possible enterprise. It soon seemed a proximate one. If
      Cecilia! He left the exclamation a blank, but not an empty dash in the
      brain; rather like the shroud of night on a vast and gloriously imagined
      land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nay, the prospect was partly visible, as the unknown country becomes by
      degrees to the traveller&rsquo;s optics on the dark hill-tops. It is much, of
      course, to be domestically well-mated: but to be fortified and armed by
      one&rsquo;s wife with a weapon to fight the world, is rare good fortune; a
      rapturous and an infinite satisfaction. He could now support of his own
      resources a weekly paper. A paper published weekly, however, is a poor
      thing, out of the tide, behind the date, mainly a literary periodical, no
      foremost combatant in politics, no champion in the arena; hardly better
      than a commentator on the events of the six past days; an echo, not a
      voice. It sits on a Saturday bench and pretends to sum up. Who listens?
      The verdict knocks dust out of a cushion. It has no steady continuous
      pressure of influence. It is the organ of sleepers. Of all the bigger
      instruments of money, it is the feeblest, Beauchamp thought. His constant
      faith in the good effects of utterance naturally inclined him to value six
      occasions per week above one; and in the fight he was for waging, it was
      necessary that he should enter the ring and hit blow for blow sans
      intermission. A statement that he could call false must be challenged hot
      the next morning. The covert Toryism, the fits of flunkeyism, the
      cowardice, of the relapsing middle-class, which is now England before
      mankind, because it fills the sails of the Press, must be exposed. It
      supports the Press in its own interests, affecting to speak for the
      people. It belies the people. And this Press, declaring itself
      independent, can hardly walk for fear of treading on an interest here, an
      interest there. It cannot have a conscience. It is a bad guide, a false
      guardian; its abject claim to be our national and popular interpreter-even
      that is hollow and a mockery! It is powerful only while subservient. An
      engine of money, appealing to the sensitiveness of money, it has no
      connection with the mind of the nation. And that it is not of, but apart
      from, the people, may be seen when great crises come. Can it stop a war?
      The people would, and with thunder, had they the medium. But in strong
      gales the power of the Press collapses; it wheezes like a pricked pigskin
      of a piper. At its best Beauchamp regarded our lordly Press as a curiously
      diapered curtain and delusive mask, behind which the country struggles
      vainly to show an honest feature; and as a trumpet that deafened and
      terrorized the people; a mere engine of leaguers banded to keep a smooth
      face upon affairs, quite soullessly: he meanwhile having to be dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a Journal that should be actually independent of circulation and
      advertisements: a popular journal in the true sense, very lungs to the
      people, for them to breathe freely through at last, and be heard out of
      it, with well-paid men of mark to head and aid them;&mdash;the
      establishment of such a Journal seemed to him brave work of a life, though
      one should die early. The money launching it would be coin washed pure of
      its iniquity of selfish reproduction, by service to mankind. This DAWN of
      his conception stood over him like a rosier Aurora for the country. He
      beheld it in imagination as a new light rising above hugeous London. You
      turn the sheets of THE DAWN, and it is the manhood of the land addressing
      you, no longer that alternately puling and insolent cry of the coffers.
      The health, wealth, comfort, contentment of the greater number are there
      to be striven for, in contempt of compromise and &lsquo;unseasonable times.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp&rsquo;s illuminated dream of the power of his DAWN to vitalize old
      England, liberated him singularly from his wearing regrets and
      heart-sickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely Cecilia, who judged him sincere, might be bent to join hands with
      him for so good a work! She would bring riches to her husband: sufficient.
      He required the ablest men of the country to write for him, and it was
      just that they should be largely paid. They at least in their present
      public apathy would demand it. To fight the brewers, distillers,
      publicans, the shopkeepers, the parsons, the landlords, the law limpets,
      and also the indifferents, the logs, the cravens and the fools, high
      talent was needed, and an ardour stimulated by rates of pay outdoing the
      offers of the lucre-journals. A large annual outlay would therefore be
      needed; possibly for as long as a quarter of a century. Cecilia and her
      husband would have to live modestly. But her inheritance would be immense.
      Colonel Halkett had never spent a tenth of his income. In time he might be
      taught to perceive in THE DAWN the one greatly beneficent enterprise of
      his day. He might through his daughter&rsquo;s eyes, and the growing success of
      the Journal. Benevolent and gallant old man, patriotic as he was, and kind
      at heart, he might learn to see in THE DAWN a broader channel of
      philanthropy and chivalry than any we have yet had a notion of in England!&mdash;a
      school of popular education into the bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp reverted to the shining curl. It could not have been clearer to
      vision if it had lain under his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ay, that first wild life of his was dead. He had slain it. Now for the
      second and sober life! Who can say? The Countess of Romfrey suggested it:&mdash;Cecilia
      may have prompted him in his unknown heart to the sacrifice of a lawless
      love, though he took it for simply barren iron duty. Brooding on her, he
      began to fancy the victory over himself less and less a lame one: for it
      waxed less and less difficult in his contemplation of it. He was looking
      forward instead of back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who cut off the lock? Probably Cecilia herself; and thinking at the moment
      that he would see it, perhaps beg for it. The lustrous little ring of hair
      wound round his heart; smiled both on its emotions and its aims; bound
      them in one.
    </p>
    <p>
      But proportionately as he grew tender to Cecilia, his consideration for
      Renee increased; that became a law to him: pity nourished it, and glimpses
      of self-contempt, and something like worship of her high-heartedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote to the countess, forbidding her sharply and absolutely to attempt
      a vindication of him by explanations to any persons whomsoever; and
      stating that he would have no falsehoods told, he desired her to keep to
      the original tale of the visit of the French family to her as guests of
      the Countess of Romfrey. Contradictory indeed. Rosamund shook her head
      over him. For a wilful character that is guilty of issuing contradictory
      commands to friends who would be friends in spite of him, appears to be
      expressly angling for the cynical spirit, so surely does it rise and snap
      at such provocation. He was even more emphatic when they next met. He
      would not listen to a remonstrance; and though, of course, her love of him
      granted him the liberty to speak to her in what tone he pleased, there
      were sensations proper to her new rank which his intemperateness wounded
      and tempted to revolt when he vexed her with unreason. She had a glimpse
      of the face he might wear to his enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quite as resolute, too, about that slight matter of the Jersey
      bull. He had the bull in Bevisham, and would not give him up without the
      sign manual of Lord Romfrey to an agreement to resign him over to the
      American Quaker gentleman, after a certain term. Moreover, not once had
      he, by exclamation or innuendo, during the period of his recent grief for
      the loss of his first love, complained of his uncle Everard&rsquo;s refusal in
      the old days to aid him in suing for Renee. Rosamund had expected that he
      would. She thought it unloverlike in him not to stir the past, and to bow
      to intolerable facts. This idea of him, coming in conjunction with his
      present behaviour, convinced her that there existed a contradiction in his
      nature: whence it ensued that she lost her warmth as an advocate designing
      to intercede for him with Cecilia; and warmth being gone, the power of the
      scandal seemed to her unassailable. How she could ever have presumed to
      combat it, was an astonishment to her. Cecilia might be indulgent, she
      might have faith in Nevil. Little else could be hoped for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occupations, duties, and ceremonies of her new position contributed to
      the lassitude into which Rosamund sank. And she soon had a communication
      to make to her lord, the nature of which was more startling to herself,
      even tragic. The bondwoman is a free woman compared with the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey&rsquo;s friends noticed a glow of hearty health in the splendid old
      man, and a prouder animation of eye and stature; and it was agreed that
      matrimony suited him well. Luckily for Cecil he did not sulk very long. A
      spectator of the earl&rsquo;s first introduction to the House of Peers, he
      called on his uncle the following day, and Rosamund accepted his homage in
      her husband&rsquo;s presence. He vowed that my lord was the noblest figure in
      the whole assembly; that it had been to him the most moving sight he had
      ever witnessed; that Nevil should have been there to see it and experience
      what he had felt; it would have done old Nevil incalculable good! and as
      far as his grief at the idea and some reticence would let him venture, he
      sighed to think of the last Earl of Romfrey having been seen by him taking
      the seat of his fathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey shouted &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; like a checked peal of laughter, and glanced at
      his wife.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLV. A LITTLE PLOT AGAINST CECILIA
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some days before Easter week Seymour Austin went to Mount Laurels for
      rest, at an express invitation from Colonel Halkett. The working
      barrister, who is also a working member of Parliament, is occasionally
      reminded that this mortal machine cannot adapt itself in perpetuity to the
      long hours of labour by night in the House of Commons as well as by day in
      the Courts, which would seem to have been arranged by a compliant country
      for the purpose of aiding his particular, and most honourable, ambition to
      climb, while continuing to fill his purse. Mr. Austin broke down early in
      the year. He attributed it to a cold. Other representative gentlemen were
      on their backs, of whom he could admit that the protracted nightwork had
      done them harm, with the reservation that their constitutions were
      originally unsound. But the House cannot get on without lawyers, and
      lawyers must practise their profession, and if they manage both to
      practise all day and sit half the night, others should be able to do the
      simple late sitting; and we English are an energetic people, we must toil
      or be beaten: and besides, &lsquo;night brings counsel,&rsquo; men are cooler and
      wiser by night. Any amount of work can be performed by careful feeders: it
      is the stomach that kills the Englishman. Brains are never the worse for
      activity; they subsist on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      These arguments and citations, good and absurd, of a man more at home in
      his harness than out of it, were addressed to the colonel to stop his
      remonstrances and idle talk about burning the candle at both ends. To that
      illustration Mr. Austin replied that he did not burn it in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you don&rsquo;t want money, Austin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; but since I&rsquo;ve had the habit of making it I have taken to like it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you&rsquo;re not ambitious.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very little; but I should be sorry to be out of the tideway.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I call it a system of slaughter,&rsquo; said the colonel; and Mr. Austin said,
      &lsquo;The world goes in that way&mdash;love and slaughter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not suicide though,&rsquo; Colonel Halkett muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, that&rsquo;s only incidental.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The casual word &lsquo;love&rsquo; led Colonel Halkett to speak to Cecilia of an old
      love-affair of Seymour Austin&rsquo;s, in discussing the state of his health
      with her. The lady was the daughter of a famous admiral, handsome, and
      latterly of light fame. Mr. Austin had nothing to regret in her having
      married a man richer than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish he had married a good woman,&rsquo; said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He looks unwell, papa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He thinks you&rsquo;re looking unwell, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He thinks that of me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia prepared a radiant face for Mr. Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      She forgot to keep it kindled, and he suspected her to be a victim of one
      of the forms of youthful melancholy, and laid stress on the benefit to
      health of a change of scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have just returned from Wales,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remarked that it was hardly a change to be within shot of our
      newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colour left her cheeks. She fancied her father had betrayed her to the
      last man who should know her secret. Beauchamp and the newspapers were
      rolled together in her mind by the fever of apprehension wasting her ever
      since his declaration of Republicanism, and defence of it, and an allusion
      to one must imply the other, she feared: feared, but far from quailingly.
      She had come to think that she could read the man she loved, and detect a
      reasonableness in his extravagance. Her father had discovered the impolicy
      of attacking Beauchamp in her hearing. The fever by which Cecilia was
      possessed on her lover&rsquo;s behalf, often overcame discretion, set her
      judgement in a whirl, was like a delirium. How it had happened she knew
      not. She knew only her wretched state; a frenzy seized her whenever his
      name was uttered, to excuse, account for, all but glorify him publicly.
      And the immodesty of her conduct was perceptible to her while she thus
      made her heart bare. She exposed herself once of late at Itchincope, and
      had tried to school her tongue before she went there. She felt that she
      should inevitably be seen through by Seymour Austin if he took the world&rsquo;s
      view of Beauchamp, and this to her was like a descent on the rapids to an
      end one shuts eyes from.
    </p>
    <p>
      He noticed her perturbation, and spoke of it to her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m very miserable about her,&rsquo; the colonel confessed. &lsquo;Girls don&rsquo;t
      see... they can&rsquo;t guess... they have no idea of the right kind of man for
      them. A man like Blackburn Tuckham, now, a man a father could leave his
      girl to, with confidence! He works for me like a slave; I can&rsquo;t guess why.
      He doesn&rsquo;t look as if he were attracted. There&rsquo;s a man! but, no;
      harum-scarum fellows take their fancy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is she that kind of young lady?&rsquo; said Mr. Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one would have thought so. She pretends to have opinions upon politics
      now. It&rsquo;s of no use to talk of it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Beauchamp was fully indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Austin proposed to Cecilia that they should spend Easter week in Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face lighted and clouded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like it,&rsquo; she said, negatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the objection?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None, except that Mount Laurels in Spring has grown dear to me; and we
      have engagements in London. I am not quick, I suppose, at new projects. I
      have ordered the yacht to be fitted out for a cruise in the Mediterranean
      early in the Summer. There is an objection, I am sure&mdash;yes; papa has
      invited Mr. Tuckham here for Easter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We could carry him with us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but I should wish to be entirely under your tutelage in Rome.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We would pair: your father and he; you and I.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We might do that. But Mr. Tuckham is like you, devoted to work; and,
      unlike you, careless of Antiquities and Art.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a hard and serious worker, and therefore the best of companions for
      a holiday. At present he is working for the colonel, who would easily
      persuade him to give over, and come with us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He certainly does love papa,&rsquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Austin dwelt on that subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia perceived that she had praised Mr. Tuckham for his devotedness to
      her father without recognizing the beauty of nature in the young man who
      could voluntarily take service under the elder he esteemed, in simple
      admiration of him. Mr. Austin scarcely said so much, or expected her to
      see the half of it, but she wished to be extremely grateful, and could
      only see at all by kindling altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He does himself injustice in his manner,&rsquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That has become somewhat tempered,&rsquo; Mr. Austin assured her, and he
      acknowledged what it had been with a smile that she reciprocated.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rough man of rare quality civilizing under various influences, and half
      ludicrous, a little irritating, wholly estimable, has frequently won the
      benign approbation of the sex. In addition, this rough man over whom she
      smiled was one of the few that never worried her concerning her hand.
      There was not a whisper of it in him. He simply loved her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia welcomed him to Mount Laurels with grateful gladness. The colonel
      had hastened Mr. Tuckham&rsquo;s visit in view of the expedition to Rome, and
      they discoursed of it at the luncheon table. Mr. Tuckham let fall that he
      had just seen Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did he thank you for his inheritance?&rsquo; Colonel Halkett inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not he!&rsquo; Tuckham replied jovially.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia&rsquo;s eyes, quick to flash, were dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel said: &lsquo;I suppose you told him nothing of what you had done for
      him?&rsquo; and said Tuckham: &lsquo;Oh no: what anybody else would have done&rsquo;; and
      proceeded to recount that he had called at Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s on the chance of
      an interview with his friend Lydiard, who used generally to be hanging
      about the cottage. &lsquo;But now he&rsquo;s free: his lunatic wife is dead, and I&rsquo;m
      happy to think I was mistaken as to Miss Denham. Men practising literature
      should marry women with money. The poor girl changed colour when I
      informed her he had been released for upwards of three months. The old
      Radical&rsquo;s not the thing in health. He&rsquo;s anxious about leaving her alone in
      the world; he said so to me. Beauchamp&rsquo;s for rigging out a yacht to give
      him a sail. It seems that salt water did him some good last year. They&rsquo;re
      both of them rather the worse for a row at one of their meetings in the
      North in support of that public nuisance, the democrat and atheist
      Roughleigh. The Radical doctor lost a hat, and Beauchamp almost lost an
      eye. He would have been a Nelson of politics, if he had been a monops,
      with an excuse for not seeing. It&rsquo;s a trifle to them; part of their
      education. They call themselves students. Rome will be capital, Miss
      Halkett. You&rsquo;re an Italian scholar, and I beg to be accepted as a pupil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear we have postponed the expedition too long,&rsquo; said Cecilia. She
      could have sunk with languor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too long?&rsquo; cried Colonel Halkett, mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Until too late, I mean, papa. Do you not think, Mr. Austin, that a
      fortnight in Rome is too short a time?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not if we make it a month, my dear Cecilia.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is not our salt air better for you? The yacht shall be fitted out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a poor sailor!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Besides, a hasty excursion to Italy brings one&rsquo;s anticipated regrets at
      the farewell too close to the pleasure of beholding it, for the enjoyment
      of that luxury of delight which I associate with the name of Italy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, my dear child,&rsquo; said her father, &lsquo;you were all for going, the other
      day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not remember it,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;One plans agreeable schemes. At least
      we need not hurry from home so very soon after our return. We have been
      travelling incessantly. The cottage in Wales is not home. It is hardly
      fair to Mount Laurels to quit it without observing the changes of the
      season in our flowers and birds here. And we have visitors coming. Of
      course, papa, I would not chain you to England. If I am not well enough to
      accompany you, I can go to Louise for a few weeks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Was ever transparency so threadbare? Cecilia shrank from herself in
      contemplating it when she was alone; and Colonel Halkett put the question
      to Mr. Austin, saying to him privately, with no further reserve: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
      that fellow Beauchamp in the neighbourhood; I&rsquo;m not so blind. He&rsquo;ll be
      knocking at my door, and I can&rsquo;t lock him out. Austin, would you guess it
      was my girl speaking? I never in my life had such an example of
      intoxication before me. I &lsquo;m perfectly miserable at the sight. You know
      her; she was the proudest girl living. Her ideas were orderly and sound;
      she had a good intellect. Now she more than half defends him&mdash;a naval
      officer! good Lord!&mdash;for getting up in a public room to announce that
      he &lsquo;s a Republican, and writing heaps of mad letters to justify himself.
      He&rsquo;s ruined in his profession: hopeless! He can never get a ship: his
      career&rsquo;s cut short, he&rsquo;s a rudderless boat. A gentleman drifting to
      Bedlam, his uncle calls him. I call his treatment of Grancey Lespel
      anything but gentlemanly. This is the sort of fellow my girl worships!
      What can I do? I can&rsquo;t interdict the house to him: it would only make
      matters worse. Thank God, the fellow hangs fire somehow, and doesn&rsquo;t come
      to me. I expect it every day, either in a letter or the man in person. And
      I declare to heaven I&rsquo;d rather be threading a Khyber Pass with my poor old
      friend who fell to a shot there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She certainly has another voice,&rsquo; Mr. Austin assented gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not look on Beauchamp as the best of possible husbands for Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let her see that you&rsquo;re anxious, Austin,&rsquo; said the colonel. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m her old
      opponent in this affair. She loves me, but she&rsquo;s accustomed to think me
      prejudiced: you she won&rsquo;t. You may have a good effect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not by speaking.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no; no assault: not a word, and not a word against him. Lay the wind
      to catch a gossamer. I&rsquo;ve had my experience of blowing cold, and trying to
      run her down. He&rsquo;s at Shrapnel&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;ll be up here to-day, and I have an
      engagement in the town. Don&rsquo;t quit her side. Let her fancy you are
      interested in some discussion&mdash;Radicalism, if you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Austin readily undertook to mount guard over her while her father rode
      into Bevisham on business.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enemy appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia saw him, and could not step to meet him for trouble of heart. It
      was bliss to know that he lived and was near.
    </p>
    <p>
      A transient coldness following the fit of ecstasy enabled her to swin
      through the terrible first minutes face to face with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He folded her round like a mist; but it grew a problem to understand why
      Mr. Austin should be perpetually at hand, in the garden, in the woods, in
      the drawing-room, wheresoever she wakened up from one of her trances to
      see things as they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Beauchamp, with a daring and cunning at which her soul exulted, and
      her feminine nature trembled, as at the divinely terrible, had managed to
      convey to her no less than if they had been alone together.
    </p>
    <p>
      His parting words were: &lsquo;I must have five minutes with your father
      to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      How had she behaved? What could be Seymour Austin&rsquo;s idea of her?
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw the blind thing that she was, the senseless thing, the shameless;
      and vulture-like in her scorn of herself, she alighted on that disgraced
      Cecilia and picked her to pieces hungrily. It was clear: Beauchamp had
      meant nothing beyond friendly civility: it was only her abject greediness
      pecking at crumbs. No! he loved her. Could a woman&rsquo;s heart be mistaken?
      She melted and wept, thanking him: she offered him her remnant of pride,
      pitiful to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      And still she asked herself between-whiles whether it could be true of an
      English lady of our day, that she, the fairest stature under sun, was ever
      knowingly twisted to this convulsion. She seemed to look forth from a
      barred window on flower, and field, and hill. Quietness existed as a
      vision. Was it impossible to embrace it? How pass into it? By surrendering
      herself to the flames, like a soul unto death! For why, if they were
      overpowering, attempt to resist them? It flattered her to imagine that she
      had been resisting them in their present burning might ever since her
      lover stepped on the Esperanza&rsquo;s deck at the mouth of Otley River. How
      foolish, seeing that they are fatal! A thrill of satisfaction swept her in
      reflecting that her ability to reason was thus active. And she was
      instantly rewarded for surrendering; pain fled, to prove her reasoning
      good; the flames devoured her gently they cared not to torture so long as
      they had her to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night, candle in hand, on the corridor, her father told her he had come
      across Grancey Lespel in Bevisham, and heard what he had not quite
      relished of the Countess of Romfrey. The glittering of Cecilia&rsquo;s eyes
      frightened him. Taking her for the moment to know almost as much as he,
      the colonel doubted the weight his communication would have on her; he
      talked obscurely of a scandalous affair at Lord Romfrey&rsquo;s house in town,
      and Beauchamp and that Frenchwoman. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;Mrs. Grancey will be
      here to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So will Nevil, papa,&rsquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! he&rsquo;s coming, yes; well!&rsquo; the colonel puffed. &lsquo;Well, I shall see him,
      of course, but I... I can only say that if his oath &lsquo;s worth having, I ...
      and I think you too, my dear, if you... but it&rsquo;s no use anticipating. I
      shall stand out for your honour and happiness. There, your cheeks are
      flushed. Go and sleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Some idle tale! Cecilia murmured to herself a dozen times, undisturbed by
      the recurrence of it. Nevil was coming to speak to her father tomorrow!
      Adieu to doubt and division! Happy to-morrow! and dear Mount Laurels! The
      primroses were still fair in the woods: and soon the cowslips would come,
      and the nightingale; she lay lapt in images of everything innocently
      pleasing to Nevil. Soon the Esperanza would be spreading wings. She
      revelled in a picture of the yacht on a tumbling Mediterranean Sea,
      meditating on the two specks near the tiller,&mdash;who were blissful
      human creatures, blest by heaven and in themselves&mdash;with luxurious
      Olympian benevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all that, she awoke, starting up in the first cold circle of twilight,
      her heart in violent action. She had dreamed that the vessel was wrecked.
      &lsquo;I did not think myself so cowardly,&rsquo; she said aloud, pressing her side
      and then, with the dream in her eyes, she gasped: &lsquo;It would be together!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Strangely chilled, she tried to recover some fallen load. The birds of the
      dawn twittered, chirped, dived aslant her window, fluttered back. Instead
      of a fallen load, she fancied presently that it was an expectation she was
      desiring to realize: but what? What could be expected at that hour? She
      quitted her bed, and paced up and down the room beneath a gold-starred
      ceiling. Her expectation, she resolved to think, was of a splendid day of
      the young Spring at Mount Laurels&mdash;a day to praise to Nevil.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her window-blind at a window letting in sweet air, to gather
      indications of promising weather. Her lover stood on the grass-plot among
      the flower-beds below, looking up, as though it had been his expectation
      to see her which had drawn her to gaze out with an idea of some
      expectation of her own. So visionary was his figure in the grey
      solitariness of the moveless morning that she stared at the apparition,
      scarce putting faith in him as man, until he kissed his hand to her, and
      had softly called her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Impulsively she waved a hand from her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there was no retreat for either of them!
    </p>
    <p>
      She awoke to this conviction after a flight of blushes that burnt her
      thoughts to ashes as they sprang. Thoughts born blushing, all of the
      crimson colour, a rose-garden, succeeded, and corresponding with their
      speed her feet paced the room, both slender hands crossed at her throat
      under an uplifted chin, and the curves of her dark eyelashes dropped as in
      a swoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He loves me!&rsquo; The attestation of it had been visible. &lsquo;No one but me!&rsquo; 
      Was that so evident?
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father picked up silly stories of him&mdash;a man who made enemies
      recklessly!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia was petrified by a gentle tapping at her door. Her father called
      to her, and she threw on her dressing-gown, and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel was in his riding-suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t slept a wink, and I find it&rsquo;s the same with you,&rsquo; he said,
      paining her with his distressed kind eyes. &lsquo;I ought not to have hinted
      anything last night without proofs. Austin&rsquo;s as unhappy as I am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At what, my dear papa, at what?&rsquo; cried Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ride over to Steynham this morning, and I shall bring you proofs, my
      poor child, proofs. That foreign tangle of his...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You speak of Nevil, papa?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a common scandal over London. That Frenchwoman was found at Lord
      Romfrey&rsquo;s house; Lady Romfrey cloaked it. I believe the woman would swear
      black&rsquo;s white to make Nevil Beauchamp appear an angel; and he&rsquo;s a
      desperately cunning hand with women. You doubt that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had shuddered slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t doubt if I bring you proofs. Till I come back from Steynham, I
      ask you not to see him alone: not to go out to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel glanced at her windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia submitted to the request, out of breath, consenting to feel like a
      tutored girl, that she might conceal her guilty knowledge of what was to
      be seen through the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now I&rsquo;m off,&rsquo; said he, and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you would accept Nevil&rsquo;s word!&rsquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not where women are concerned!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He left her with this remark, which found no jealous response in her
      heart, yet ranged over certain dispersed inflammable grains, like a match
      applied to damp powder; again and again running in little leaps of
      harmless firm keeping her alive to its existence, and surprising her that
      it should not have been extinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp presented himself rather late in the afternoon, when Mr. Austin
      and Blackburn Tuckham were sipping tea in Cecilia&rsquo;s boudoir with that
      lady, and a cousin of her sex, by whom she was led to notice a faint
      discoloration over one of his eyes, that was, considering whence it came,
      repulsive to compassion. A blow at a Radical meeting! He spoke of Dr.
      Shrapnel to Tuckham, and assuredly could not complain that the latter was
      unsympathetic in regard to the old man&rsquo;s health, though when he said,
      &lsquo;Poor old man! he fears he will die!&rsquo; Tuckham rejoined: &lsquo;He had better
      make his peace.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He fears he will die, because of his leaving Miss Denham unprotected,&rsquo; 
      said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, she&rsquo;s a good-looking girl: he&rsquo;ll be able to leave her something,
      and he might easily get her married, I should think,&rsquo; said Tuckham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s not satisfied with handing her to any kind of man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If the choice is to be among Radicals and infidels, I don&rsquo;t wonder. He
      has come to one of the tests.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia heard Beauchamp speaking of a newspaper. A great Radical Journal,
      unmatched in sincerity, superior in ability, soon to be equal in power, to
      the leader and exemplar of the lucre-Press, would some day see the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll want money for that,&rsquo; said Tuckham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you prepared to stand forty or fifty thousand a year?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It need not be half so much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Counting the libels, I rate the outlay rather low.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, lawyers, judges, and juries of tradesmen, dealing justice to a
      Radical print!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuckham brushed his hand over his mouth and ahemed. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s to be a penny
      journal?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, a penny. I&rsquo;d make it a farthing&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pay to have it read?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Willingly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuckham did some mental arithmetic, quaintly, with rapidly blinking
      eyelids and open mouth. &lsquo;You may count it at the cost of two paying
      mines,&rsquo; he said firmly. &lsquo;That is, if it&rsquo;s to be a consistently Radical
      Journal, at law with everybody all round the year. And by the time it has
      won a reputation, it will be undermined by a radicaller Radical Journal.
      That&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ve lowered the country to this level. That&rsquo;s an Inferno of
      Circles, down to the ultimate mire. And what on earth are you contending
      for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Freedom of thought, for one thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have quite enough free-thinking.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s not enough if there&rsquo;s not perfect freedom.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dangerous!&rsquo; quoth Mr. Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s that danger which makes men, sir; and it&rsquo;s fear of the danger
      that makes our modern Englishman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Oh!&rsquo; cried Tuckham in the voice of a Parliamentary Opposition. &lsquo;Well,
      you start your paper, we&rsquo;ll assume it: what class of men will you get to
      write?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall get good men for the hire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t get the best men; you may catch a clever youngster or two, and
      an old rogue of talent; you won&rsquo;t get men of weight. They&rsquo;re prejudiced, I
      dare say. The Journals which are commercial speculations give us a
      guarantee that they mean to be respectable; they must, if they wouldn&rsquo;t
      collapse. That&rsquo;s why the best men consent to write for them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Money will do it,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Austin disagreed with that observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some patriotic spirit, I may hope, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Austin shook his head. &lsquo;We put different constructions upon
      patriotism.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Besides&mdash;fiddle! nonsense!&rsquo; exclaimed Tuckham in the mildest
      interjections he could summon for a vent in society to his offended common
      sense; &lsquo;the better your men the worse your mark. You&rsquo;re not dealing with
      an intelligent people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the old charge against the people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But they&rsquo;re not. You can madden, you can&rsquo;t elevate them by writing and
      writing. Defend us from the uneducated English! The common English are
      doltish; except in the North, where you won&rsquo;t do much with them. Compare
      them with the Yankees for shrewdness, the Spaniards for sobriety, the
      French for ingenuity, the Germans for enlightenment, the Italians in the
      Arts; yes, the Russians for good-humour and obedience&mdash;where are
      they? They&rsquo;re only worth something when they&rsquo;re led. They fight well;
      there&rsquo;s good stuff in them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard all that before,&rsquo; returned Beauchamp, unruffled. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t
      know them. I mean to educate them by giving them an interest in their
      country. At present they have next to none. Our governing class is
      decidedly unintelligent, in my opinion brutish, for it&rsquo;s indifferent. My
      paper shall render your traders justice for what they do, and justice for
      what they don&rsquo;t do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My traders, as you call them, are the soundest foundation for a civilized
      state that the world has yet seen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is your paper to be called?&rsquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The DAWN,&rsquo; Beauchamp answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She blushed fiery red, and turned the leaves of a portfolio of drawings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The DAWN!&rsquo; ejaculated Tuckham. &lsquo;The grey-eyed, or the red? Extraordinary
      name for a paper, upon my word!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A paper that doesn&rsquo;t devote half its columns to the vices of the rich&mdash;to
      money-getting, spending and betting&mdash;will be an extraordinary paper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have it before me now!&mdash;two doses of flattery to one of the whip.
      No, no; you haven&rsquo;t hit the disease. We want union, not division. Turn
      your mind to being a moralist, instead of a politician.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The distinction shouldn&rsquo;t exist!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only it does!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grancey Lespel&rsquo;s entrance diverted their dialogue from a theme
      wearisome to Cecilia, for Beauchamp shone but darkly in it, and Mr. Austin
      did not join in it. Mrs. Grancey touched Beauchamp&rsquo;s fingers. &lsquo;Still
      political?&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;You have been seen about London with a French
      officer in uniform.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was M. le comte de Croisnel, a very old friend and comrade of mine,&rsquo; 
      Beauchamp replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do those Frenchmen everlastingly wear their uniforms?&mdash;tell me!
      Don&rsquo;t you think it detestable style?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He came over in a hurry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, don&rsquo;t be huffed. I know you, for defending your friends, Captain
      Beauchamp! Did he not come over with ladies?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With relatives, yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Relatives of course. But when British officers travel with ladies,
      relatives or other, they prefer the simplicity of mufti, and so do I, as a
      question of taste, I must say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was quite by misadventure that M. de Croisnel chanced to come in his
      uniform.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! I know you, for defending your friends, Captain Beauchamp. He was in
      too great a hurry to change his uniform before he started, or en route?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it happened.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grancey let a lingering eye dwell maliciously on Beauchamp, who said,
      to shift the burden of it: &lsquo;The French are not so jealous of military
      uniforms as we are. M. de Croisnel lost his portmanteau.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! lost it! Then of course he is excuseable, except to the naked eye.
      Dear me! you have had a bruise on yours. Was Monsieur votre ami in the
      Italian campaign?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, poor fellow, he was not. He is not an Imperialist; he had to remain
      in garrison.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He wore a multitude of medals, I have been told. A cup of tea, Cecilia.
      And how long did he stay in England with his relatives?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Two days.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only two days! A very short visit indeed&mdash;singularly short. Somebody
      informed me of their having been seen at Romfrey Castle, which cannot have
      been true.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her eyes from Beauchamp silent to Cecilia&rsquo;s hand on the teapot.
      &lsquo;Half a cup,&rsquo; she said mildly, to spare the poor hand its betrayal of
      nervousness, and relapsed from her air of mistress of the situation to
      chatter to Mr. Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp continued silent. He took up a book, and presently a pencil from
      his pocket, then talked of the book to Cecilia&rsquo;s cousin; and leaving a
      paper-cutter between the leaves, he looked at Cecilia and laid the book
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      She proceeded to conduct Mrs. Grancey Lespel to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do admire Captain Beauchamp&rsquo;s cleverness; he is as good as a French
      romance!&rsquo; Mrs. Grancey exclaimed on the stairs. &lsquo;He fibs charmingly. I
      could not help drawing him out. Two days! Why, my dear, his French party
      were a fortnight in the country. It was the marquise, you know&mdash;the
      old affair; and one may say he&rsquo;s a constant man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not heard Captain Beauchamp&rsquo;s cleverness much praised,&rsquo; said
      Cecilia. &lsquo;This is your room, Mrs. Grancey.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay with me a moment. It is the room I like. Are we to have him at
      dinner?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia did not suppose that Captain Beauchamp would remain to dine.
      Feeling herself in the clutches of a gossip, she would fain have gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am just one bit glad of it, though I can&rsquo;t dislike him personally,&rsquo; 
      said Mrs. Grancey, detaining her and beginning to whisper. &lsquo;It was really
      too bad. There was a French party at the end, but there was only one at
      the commencement. The brother was got over for a curtain, before the
      husband arrived in pursuit. They say the trick Captain Beauchamp played
      his cousin Cecil, to get him out of the house when he had made a
      discovery, was monstrous&mdash;fiendishly cunning. However, Lady Romfrey,
      as that woman appears to be at last, covered it all. You know she has one
      of those passions for Captain Beauchamp which completely blind women to
      right and wrong. He is her saint, let him sin ever so! The story&rsquo;s in
      everybody&rsquo;s mouth. By the way, Palmet saw her. He describes her pale as
      marble, with dark long eyes, the most innocent look in the world, and a
      walk, the absurd fellow says, like a statue set gliding. No doubt
      Frenchwomen do walk well. He says her eyes are terrible traitors; I need
      not quote Palmet. The sort of eyes that would look fondly on a stone, you
      know. What her reputation is in France I have only indistinctly heard. She
      has one in England by this time, I can assure you. She found her match in
      Captain Beauchamp for boldness. Where any other couple would have seen
      danger, they saw safety; and they contrived to accomplish it, according to
      those horrid talebearers. You have plenty of time to dress, my dear; I
      have an immense deal to talk about. There are half-a-dozen scandals in
      London already, and you ought to know them, or you will be behind the
      tittle-tattle when you go to town; and I remember, as a girl, I knew
      nothing so excruciating as to hear blanks, dashes, initials, and half
      words, without the key. Nothing makes a girl look so silly and
      unpalatable. Naturally, the reason why Captain Beauchamp is more talked
      about than the rest is the politics. Your grand reformer should be
      careful. Doubly heterodox will not do! It makes him interesting to women,
      if you like, but he won&rsquo;t soon hear the last of it, if he is for a public
      career. Grancey literally crowed at the story. And the wonderful part of
      it is, that Captain Beauchamp refused to be present at the earl&rsquo;s first
      ceremonial dinner in honour of his countess. Now, that, we all think, was
      particularly ungrateful: now, was it not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If the countess&mdash;if ingratitude had anything to do with it,&rsquo; said
      Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      She escaped to her room and dressed impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her boudoir was empty: Beauchamp had departed. She recollected his look at
      her, and turned over the leaves of the book he had been hastily scanning,
      and had condescended to approve of. On the two pages where the
      paper-cutter was fixed she perceived small pencil dots under certain
      words. Read consecutively, with a participle termination struck out to
      convey his meaning, they formed the pathetically ungrammatical line:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hear: none: but: accused: false.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Treble dots were under the word &lsquo;to-morrow.&rsquo; He had scored the margin of
      the sentences containing his dotted words, as if in admiration of their
      peculiar wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought it piteous that he should be reduced to such means of
      communication. The next instant Cecilia was shrinking from the adept
      intriguer&mdash;French-taught!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the evening her cousin remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Captain Beauchamp must see merit in things undiscoverable by my poor
      faculties. I will show you a book he has marked.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you see it? I was curious to examine it,&rsquo; interposed Cecilia; &lsquo;and I
      am as much at a loss as you to understand what could have attracted him.
      One sentence...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About the sheikh in the stables, where he accused the pretended
      physician? Yes, what was there in that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is the book?&rsquo; said Mrs. Grancey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not here, I think.&rsquo; Cecilia glanced at the drawing-room book-table, and
      then at Mr. Austin, the victim of an unhappy love in his youth, and
      unhappy about her, as her father had said. Seymour Austin was not one to
      spread the contagion of intrigue! She felt herself caught by it, even
      melting to feel enamoured of herself in consequence, though not loving
      Beauchamp the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This newspaper, if it&rsquo;s not merely an airy project, will be ruination,&rsquo; 
      said Tuckham. &lsquo;The fact is, Beauchamp has no bend in him. He can&rsquo;t meet a
      man without trying a wrestle, and as long as he keeps his stiffness, he
      believes he has won. I&rsquo;ve heard an oculist say that the eye that doesn&rsquo;t
      blink ends in blindness, and he who won&rsquo;t bend breaks. It&rsquo;s a pity, for
      he&rsquo;s a fine fellow. A Radical daily Journal of Shrapnel&rsquo;s colour, to
      educate the people by giving them an interest in the country! Goodness,
      what a delusion! and what a waste of money! He&rsquo;ll not be able to carry it
      on a couple of years. And there goes his eighty thousand!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia&rsquo;s heart beat fast. She had no defined cause for its excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett returned to Mount Laurels close upon midnight, very tired,
      coughing and complaining of the bitter blowing East. His guests shook
      hands with him, and went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;ll follow their example,&rsquo; he said to Cecilia, after drinking a
      tumbler of mulled wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you nothing to tell me, dear papa?&rsquo; said she, caressing him timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A confirmation of the whole story from Lord Romfrey in person&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all. He says Beauchamp&rsquo;s mad. I begin to believe it. You must use your
      judgement. I suppose I must not expect you to consider me. You might open
      your heart to Austin. As to my consent, knowing what I do, you will have
      to tear it out of me. Here&rsquo;s a country perfectly contented, and that
      fellow at work digging up grievances to persuade the people they&rsquo;re
      oppressed by us. Why should I talk of it? He can&rsquo;t do much harm; unless he
      has money&mdash;money! Romfrey says he means to start a furious paper.
      He&rsquo;ll make a bonfire of himself. I can&rsquo;t stand by and see you in it too. I
      may die; I may be spared the sight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia flung her arms round his neck. &lsquo;Oh! papa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make him out worse than he is, my dear. I own to his
      gallantry&mdash;in the French sense as well as the English, it seems! It&rsquo;s
      natural that Romfrey should excuse his wife. She&rsquo;s another of the women
      who are crazy about Nevil Beauchamp. She spoke to me of the &ldquo;pleasant
      visit of her French friends,&rdquo; and would have enlarged on it, but Romfrey
      stopped her. By the way, he proposes Captain Baskelett for you, and we&rsquo;re
      to look for Baskelett&rsquo;s coming here, backed by his uncle. There&rsquo;s no end
      to it; there never will be till you&rsquo;re married: and no peace for me! I
      hope I shan&rsquo;t find myself with a cold to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel coughed, and perhaps exaggerated the premonitory symptoms of a
      cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Italy, papa, would do you good,&rsquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It might,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If we go immediately, papa; to-morrow, early in the morning, before there
      is a chance of any visitors coming to the house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From Bevisham?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From Steynham. I cannot endure a second persecution.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you have a world of packing, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An hour before breakfast will be sufficient for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In that case, we might be off early, as you say, and have part of the
      Easter week in Rome.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Austin wishes it greatly, papa, though he has not mentioned it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Austin, my darling girl, is not one of your impatient men who burst with
      everything they have in their heads or their hearts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! but I know him so well,&rsquo; said Cecilia, conjuring up that innocent
      enthusiasm of hers for Mr. Austin as an antidote to her sharp suffering.
      The next minute she looked on her father as the key of an enigma
      concerning Seymour Austin, whom, she imagined, possibly she had not
      hitherto known at all. Her curiosity to pierce it faded. She and her maid
      were packing through the night. At dawn she requested her maid to lift the
      window-blind and give her an opinion of the weather. &lsquo;Grey, Miss,&rsquo; the
      maid reported. It signified to Cecilia: no one roaming outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The step she was taking was a desperate attempt at a cure; and she
      commenced it, though sorely wounded, with pity for Nevil&rsquo;s disappointment,
      and a singularly clear-eyed perception of his aims and motives.&mdash;&lsquo;I
      am rich, and he wants riches; he likes me, and he reads my weakness.&rsquo;&mdash;Jealousy
      shook her by fits, but she had no right to be jealous, nor any right to
      reproach him. Her task was to climb back to those heavenly heights she sat
      on before he distracted her and drew her down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp came to a vacated house that day.

      CHAPTER XLVI. AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FORESEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was in Italy that Cecilia&rsquo;s maiden dreams of life had opened. She hoped
      to recover them in Italy, and the calm security of a mind untainted. Italy
      was to be her reviving air.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this idea of a specific for her malady endured travelling at speed
      to the ridges of the Italian frontier, across France&mdash;she simply
      remembered Nevil: he was distant; he had no place in the storied
      landscape, among the images of Art and the names of patient great men who
      bear, as they bestow, an atmosphere other than earth&rsquo;s for those adoring
      them. If at night, in her sleep, he was a memory that conducted her
      through scenes which were lightnings, the cool swift morning of her flight
      released her. France, too, her rival!&mdash;the land of France,
      personified by her instinctively, though she had no vivid imaginative
      gift, did not wound her with a poisoned dart.&mdash;&lsquo;She knew him first:
      she was his first love.&rsquo; The Alps, and the sense of having Italy below
      them, renewed Cecilia&rsquo;s lofty-perching youth. Then&mdash;I am in Italy!
      she sighed with rapture. The wine of delight and oblivion was at her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      But thirst is not enjoyment, and a satiated thirst that we insist on
      over-satisfying to drown the recollection of past anguish, is baneful to
      the soul. In Rome Cecilia&rsquo;s vision of her track to Rome was of a run of
      fire over a heath. She could scarcely feel common pleasure in Rome. It
      seemed burnt out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flung back on herself, she was condemned to undergo the bitter torment she
      had flown from: jealous love, and reproachful; and a shame in it like
      nothing she had yet experienced. Previous pains were but Summer
      lightnings, passing shadows. She could have believed in sorcery: the man
      had eaten her heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      A disposition to mocking humour, foreign to her nature, gave her the
      notion of being off her feet, in the claws of a fabulous bird. It served
      to veil her dulness. An ultra-English family in Rome, composed, shocking
      to relate, of a baronet banker and his wife, two faint-faced girls, and a
      young gentleman of our country, once perhaps a light-limbed boy, chose to
      be followed by their footman in the melancholy pomp of state livery.
      Wherever she encountered them Cecilia talked Nevil Beauchamp. Even Mr.
      Tuckham perceived it. She was extremely uncharitable: she extended her
      ungenerous criticism to the institution of the footman: England, and the
      English, were lashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These people are caricatures,&rsquo; Tuckham said, in apology for poor England
      burlesqued abroad. &lsquo;You must not generalize on them. Footmen are footmen
      all the world over. The cardinals have a fine set of footmen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are at home. Those English sow contempt of us all over Europe. We
      cannot but be despised. One comes abroad foredoomed to share the
      sentiment. This is your middle-class! What society can they move in, that
      sanctions a vulgarity so perplexing? They have the air of ornaments on a
      cottager&rsquo;s parlour mantelpiece.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuckham laughed. &lsquo;Something of that,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Evidently they seek distinction, and they have it, of that kind,&rsquo; she
      continued. &lsquo;It is not wonderful that we have so much satirical writing in
      England, with such objects of satire. It may be as little wonderful that
      the satire has no effect. Immense wealth and native obtuseness combine to
      disfigure us with this aspect of overripeness, not to say monstrosity. I
      fall in love with the poor, and think they have a cause to be pleaded,
      when I look at those people. We scoff at the vanity of the French, but it
      is a graceful vanity; pardonable compared with ours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve read all that a hundred times,&rsquo; quoth Tuckham bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So have I. I speak of it because I see it. We scoff at the simplicity of
      the Germans.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Germans live in simple fashion, because they&rsquo;re poor. French vanity&rsquo;s
      pretty and amusing. I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s deep in them, for I doubt
      their depth; but I know it&rsquo;s in their joints. The first spring of a
      Frenchman comes of vanity. That you can&rsquo;t say of the English. Peace to
      all! but I abhor cosmopolitanism. No man has a firm foothold who pretends
      to it. None despises the English in reality. Don&rsquo;t be misled, Miss
      Halkett. We&rsquo;re solid: that is the main point. The world feels our power,
      and has confidence in our good faith. I ask for no more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With Germans we are supercilious Celts; with Frenchmen we are sneering
      Teutons:&mdash;Can we be loved, Mr. Tuckham?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a quotation from my friend Lydiard. Loved? No nation ever was
      loved while it lived. As Lydiard says, it may be a good beast or a bad,
      but a beast it is. A nation&rsquo;s much too big for refined feelings and
      affections. It must be powerful or out of the way, or down it goes. When a
      nation&rsquo;s dead you may love it; but I don&rsquo;t see the use of dying to be
      loved. My aim for my country is to have the land respected. For that
      purpose we must have power; for power wealth; for wealth industry; for
      industry internal peace: therefore no agitation, no artificial divisions.
      All&rsquo;s plain in history and fact, so long as we do not obtrude
      sentimentalism. Nothing mixes well with that stuff&mdash;except poetical
      ideas!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrary to her anticipation, Cecilia was thrown more into companionship
      with Mr. Tuckham than with Mr. Austin; and though it often vexed her, she
      acknowledged that she derived a benefit from his robust antagonism of
      opinion. And Italy had grown tasteless to her. She could hardly simulate
      sufficient curiosity to serve for a vacant echo to Mr. Austin&rsquo;s historic
      ardour. Pliny the Younger might indeed be the model of a gentleman of old
      Rome; there might be a scholarly pleasure in calculating, as Mr. Austin
      did, the length of time it took Pliny to journey from the city to his
      paternal farm, or villa overlooking the lake, or villa overlooking the
      bay, and some abstruse fun in the tender ridicule of his readings of his
      poems to friends; for Mr. Austin smiled effusively in alluding to the
      illustrious Roman pleader&rsquo;s foible of verse: but Pliny bore no resemblance
      to that island barbarian Nevil Beauchamp: she could not realize the friend
      of Trajan, orator, lawyer, student, statesman, benefactor of his kind, and
      model of her own modern English gentleman, though he was. &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; she would
      reply encouragingly to Seymour Austin&rsquo;s fond brooding hum about his hero;
      and &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; conclusively: like an incarnation of stupidity dealing in
      monosyllables. She was unworthy of the society of a scholar. Nor could she
      kneel at the feet of her especial heroes: Dante, Raphael, Buonarotti: she
      was unworthy of them. She longed to be at Mount Laurels. Mr. Tuckham&rsquo;s
      conversation was the nearest approach to it&mdash;as it were round by
      Greenland; but it was homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was really grieved to lose him. Business called him to England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What business can it be, papa?&rsquo; she inquired: and the colonel replied
      briefly: &lsquo;Ours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Austin now devoted much of his time to the instruction of her in the
      ancient life of the Eternal City. He had certain volumes of Livy, Niebuhr,
      and Gibbon, from which he read her extracts at night, shunning the
      scepticism and the irony of the moderns, so that there should be no jar on
      the awakening interest of his fair pupil and patient. A gentle
      cross-hauling ensued between them, that they grew conscious of and laughed
      over during their peregrinations in and out of Rome: she pulled for the
      Republic of the Scipios; his predilections were toward the Rome of the
      wise and clement emperors. To Cecilia&rsquo;s mind Rome rocked at a period so
      closely neighbouring her decay: to him, with an imagination brooding on
      the fuller knowledge of it, the city breathed securely, the sky was clear;
      jurisprudence, rhetoric, statesmanship, then flourished supreme, and men
      eminent for culture: the finest flowers of our race, he thought them: and
      he thought their Age the manhood of Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Struck suddenly by a feminine subtle comparison that she could not have
      framed in speech, Cecilia bowed to his views of the happiness and
      elevation proper to the sway of a sagacious and magnanimous Imperialism of
      the Roman pattern:&mdash;he rejected the French. She mused on dim old
      thoughts of the gracious dignity of a woman&rsquo;s life under high
      governorship. Turbulent young men imperilled it at every step. The
      trained, the grave, the partly grey, were fitting lords and mates for
      women aspiring to moral beauty and distinction. Beside such they should be
      planted, if they would climb! Her walks and conversations with Seymour
      Austin charmed her as the haze of a summer evening charms the sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the conclusion of her term of exile Cecilia would gladly have
      remained in Italy another month. An appointment of her father&rsquo;s with Mr.
      Tuckham at Mount Laurels on a particular day she considered as of no
      consequence whatever, and she said so, in response to a meaningless nod.
      But Mr. Austin was obliged to return to work. She set her face homeward
      with his immediately, and he looked pleased: he did not try to dissuade
      her from accompanying him by affecting to think it a sacrifice: clearly he
      knew that to be near him was her greatest delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus do we round the perilous headland called love by wooing a good man
      for his friendship, and requiting him with faithful esteem for the grief
      of an ill-fortuned passion of his youth!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia would not suffer her fancy to go very far in pursuit of the secret
      of Mr. Austin&rsquo;s present feelings. Until she reached Mount Laurels she
      barely examined her own. The sight of the house warned her instantly that
      she must have a defence: and then, in desperation but with perfect
      distinctness, she entertained the hope of hearing him speak the protecting
      words which could not be broken through when wedded to her consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Austin had no intentions, it was at least strange that he did not
      part from her in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      He whose coming she dreaded had been made aware of the hour of her return,
      as his card, with the pencilled line, &lsquo;Will call on the 17th,&rsquo; informed
      her. The 17th was the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast on the morning of the 17th Seymour Austin looked her in
      the eyes longer than it is customary for ladies to have to submit to keen
      inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you come into the library?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went with him into the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it to speak of his anxiousness as to the state of her father&rsquo;s health
      that he had led her there, and that he held her hand? He alarmed her, and
      he pacified her alarm, yet bade her reflect on the matter, saying that her
      father, like other fathers, would be more at peace upon the establishment
      of his daughter. Mr. Austin remarked that the colonel was troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does he wish for my pledge never to marry without his approval? I will
      give it,&rsquo; said Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He would like you to undertake to marry the man of his choice.&rsquo; Cecilia&rsquo;s
      features hung on an expression equivalent to:&mdash;I could almost do
      that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time she felt it was not Seymour Austin&rsquo;s manner of speaking.
      He seemed to be praising an unknown person&mdash;some gentleman who was
      rough, but of solid promise and singular strength of character.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house-bell rang. Believing that Beauchamp had now come, she showed a
      painful ridging of the brows, and Mr. Austin considerately mentioned the
      name of the person he had in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She readily agreed with him regarding Mr. Tuckham&rsquo;s excellent qualities&mdash;if
      that was indeed the name; and she hastened to recollect how little she had
      forgotten Mr. Tuckham&rsquo;s generosity to Beauchamp, and confessed to herself
      it might as well have been forgotten utterly for the thanks he had
      received. While revolving these ideas she was listening to Mr. Austin;
      gradually she was beginning to understand that she was parting company
      with her original conjectures, but going at so swift a pace in so supple
      and sure a grasp, that, like the speeding train slipped on new lines of
      rails by the pointsman, her hurrying sensibility was not shocked, or the
      shock was imperceptible, when she heard him proposing Mr. Tuckham to her
      for a husband, by her father&rsquo;s authority, and with his own warm seconding.
      He had not dropped her hand: he was very eloquent, a masterly advocate: he
      pleaded her father&rsquo;s cause; it was not put to her as Mr. Tuckham&rsquo;s: her
      father had set his heart on this union he was awaiting her decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it so urgent?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is urgent. It saves him from an annoyance. He requires a son-in-law
      whom he can confidently rely on to manage the estates, which you are woman
      of the world enough to know should be in strong hands. He gives you to a
      man of settled principles. It is urgent, because he may wish to be armed
      with your answer at any instant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father entered the library. He embraced her, and &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must think, papa, I must think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She pressed her hand across her eyes. Disillusioned by Seymour Austin, she
      was utterly defenceless before Beauchamp: and possibly Beauchamp was in
      the house. She fancied he was, by the impatient brevity of her father&rsquo;s
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seymour Austin and Colonel Halkett left the room, and Blackburn Tuckham
      walked in, not the most entirely self-possessed of suitors, puffing softly
      under his breath, and blinking eyes as rapidly as a skylark claps wings on
      the ascent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later Beauchamp appeared. He asked to see the colonel,
      delivered himself of his pretensions and wishes to the colonel, and was
      referred to Cecilia; but Colonel Halkett declined to send for her.
      Beauchamp declined to postpone his proposal until the following day. He
      went outside the house and walked up and down the grass-plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia came to him at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hear, Nevil, that you are waiting to speak to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting some weeks. Shall I speak here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, here, quickly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Before the house? I have come to ask you for your hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mine? I cannot...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Step into the park with me. I ask you to marry me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is too late.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVII. THE REFUSAL OF HIM
    </h2>
    <p>
      Passing from one scene of excitement to another, Cecilia was perfectly
      steeled for her bitter task; and having done that which separated her a
      sphere&rsquo;s distance from Beauchamp, she was cold, inaccessible to the face
      of him who had swayed her on flood and ebb so long, incapable of tender
      pity, even for herself. All she could feel was a harsh joy to have struck
      off her tyrant&rsquo;s fetters, with a determination to cherish it passionately
      lest she should presently be hating herself: for the shadow of such a
      possibility fell within the narrow circle of her strung sensations. But
      for the moment her delusion reached to the idea that she had escaped from
      him into freedom, when she said, &lsquo;It is too late.&rsquo; Those words were the
      sum and voice of her long term of endurance. She said them hurriedly,
      almost in a whisper, in the manner of one changeing a theme of
      conversation for subjects happier and livelier, though none followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence bore back on her a suspicion of a faint reproachfulness in the
      words; and perhaps they carried a poetical tone, still more distasteful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been listening to tales of me,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil, we can always be friends, the best of friends.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Were you astonished at my asking you for your hand? You said &ldquo;mine?&rdquo; as
      if you wondered. You have known my feelings for you. Can you deny that? I
      have reckoned on yours&mdash;too long?&mdash;But not falsely? No, hear me
      out. The truth is, I cannot lose you. And don&rsquo;t look so resolute. Overlook
      little wounds: I was never indifferent to you. How could I be&mdash;with
      eyes in my head? The colonel is opposed to me of course: he will learn to
      understand me better: but you and I! we cannot be mere friends. It&rsquo;s like
      daylight blotted out&mdash;or the eyes gone blind:&mdash;Too late? Can you
      repeat it? I tried to warn you before you left England: I should have
      written a letter to put you on your guard against my enemies:&mdash;I find
      I have some: but a letter is sure to stumble; I should have been obliged
      to tell you that I do not stand on my defence; and I thought I should see
      you the next day. You went: and not a word for me! You gave me no chance.
      If you have no confidence in me I must bear it. I may say the story is
      false. With your hand in mine I would swear it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let it be forgotten,&rsquo; said Cecilia, surprised and shaken to think that
      her situation required further explanations; fascinated and unnerved by
      simply hearing him. &lsquo;We are now&mdash;we are walking away from the house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you object to a walk with me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They had crossed the garden plot and were at the gate of the park leading
      to the Western wood. Beauchamp swung the gate open. He cast a look at the
      clouds coming up from the South-west in folds of grey and silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like the day of our drive into Bevisham!&mdash;without the storm behind,&rsquo; 
      he said, and doated on her soft shut lips, and the mild sun-rays of her
      hair in sunless light. &lsquo;There are flowers that grow only in certain
      valleys, and your home is Mount Laurels, whatever your fancy may be for
      Italy. You colour the whole region for me. When you were absent, you were
      here. I called here six times, and walked and talked with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia set her face to the garden. Her heart had entered on a course of
      heavy thumping, like a sapper in the mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pain was not unwelcome to her, but this threatened weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      What plain words could she use? If Mr. Tuckham had been away from the
      house, she would have found it easier to speak of her engagement; she knew
      not why. Or if the imperative communication could have been delivered in
      Italian or French, she was as little able to say why it should have
      slipped from her tongue without a critic shudder to arrest it. She was
      cold enough to revolve the words: betrothed, affianced, plighted: and
      reject them, pretty words as they are. Between the vulgarity of romantic
      language, and the baldness of commonplace, it seemed to her that our
      English gives us no choice; that we cannot be dignified in simplicity. And
      for some reason, feminine and remote, she now detested her &lsquo;hand&rsquo; so much
      as to be unable to bring herself to the metonymic mention of it. The
      lady&rsquo;s difficulty was peculiar to sweet natures that have no great warmth
      of passion; it can only be indicated. Like others of the kind, it is
      traceable to the most delicate of sentiments, and to the flattest:&mdash;for
      Mr. Blackburn&rsquo;s Tuckham&rsquo;s figure was (she thought of it with no personal
      objection) not of the graceful order, neither cavalierly nor kingly: and
      imagining himself to say, &lsquo;I am engaged,&rsquo; and he suddenly appearing on the
      field, Cecilia&rsquo;s whole mind was shocked in so marked a way did he contrast
      with Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the effect of Beauchamp&rsquo;s latest words on her. He had disarmed
      her anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must have a walk to-day,&rsquo; he said commandingly, but it had stolen into
      him that he and she were not walking on the same bank of the river, though
      they were side by side: a chill water ran between them. As in other days,
      there hung her hand: but not to be taken. Incredible as it was, the icy
      sense of his having lost her benumbed him. Her beautiful face and
      beautiful tall figure, so familiar to him that they were like a
      possession, protested in his favour while they snatched her from him all
      the distance of the words &lsquo;too late.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you not give me one half-hour?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am engaged,&rsquo; Cecilia plunged and extricated herself, &lsquo;I am engaged to
      walk with Mr. Austin and papa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp tossed his head. Something induced him to speak of Mr. Tuckham.
      &lsquo;The colonel has discovered his Tory young man! It&rsquo;s an object as
      incomprehensible to me as a Tory working-man. I suppose I must take it
      that they exist. As for Blackburn Tuckham, I have nothing against him.
      He&rsquo;s an honourable fellow enough, and would govern Great Britain as men of
      that rich middle-class rule their wives&mdash;with a strict regard for
      ostensible humanity and what the law allows them. His manners have
      improved. Your cousin Mary seems to like him: it struck me when I saw them
      together. Cecilia! one half-hour! You refuse me: you have not heard me.
      You will not say too late.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil, I have said it finally. I have no longer the right to conceive it
      unsaid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So we speak! It&rsquo;s the language of indolence, temper, faint hearts. &ldquo;Too
      late&rdquo; has no meaning. Turn back with me to the park. I offer you my whole
      heart; I love you. There&rsquo;s no woman living who could be to me the wife you
      would be. I&rsquo;m like your male nightingale that you told me of: I must have
      my mate to sing to&mdash;that is, work for and live for; and she must not
      delay too long. Did I? Pardon me if you think I did. You have known I love
      you. I have been distracted by things that kept me from thinking of myself
      and my wishes: and love&rsquo;s a selfish business while... while one has work
      in hand. It&rsquo;s clear I can&rsquo;t do two things at a time&mdash;make love and
      carry on my taskwork. I have been idle for weeks. I believed you were mine
      and wanted no lovemaking. There&rsquo;s no folly in that, if you understand me
      at all. As for vanity about women, I &lsquo;ve outlived it. In comparison with
      you I&rsquo;m poor, I know:&mdash;you look distressed, but one has to allude to
      it:&mdash;I admit that wealth would help me. To see wealth supporting the
      cause of the people for once would&mdash;but you say, too late! Well, I
      don&rsquo;t renounce you till I see you giving your hand to a man who&rsquo;s not
      myself. You have been offended: groundlessly, on my honour! You are the
      woman of all women in the world to hold me fast in faith and pride in you.
      It&rsquo;s useless to look icy: you feel what I say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil, I feel grief, and beg you to cease. I am&mdash;&mdash;It is&mdash;&mdash;-&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Too late&rdquo; has not a rag of meaning, Cecilia! I love your name. I love
      this too: this is mine, and no one can rob me of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew forth a golden locket and showed her a curl of her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crimsoning, she said instantly: &lsquo;Language of the kind I used is open to
      misconstruction, I fear. I have not even the right to listen to you. I am
      ... You ask me for what I have it no longer in my power to give. I am
      engaged.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The shot rang through him and partly stunned him; but incredulity made a
      mocking effort to sustain him. The greater wounds do not immediately
      convince us of our fate, though we may be conscious that we have been hit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Engaged in earnest?&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of your free will?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father stepped out on the terrace, from one of the open windows,
      trailing a newspaper like a pocket-handkerchief. Cecilia threaded the
      flower-beds to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s an accident to one of our ironclads,&rsquo; he called to Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lives lost, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, thank heaven! but, upon my word, it&rsquo;s a warning. Read the telegram;
      it&rsquo;s the Hastings. If these are our defences, at a cost of half a million
      of money, each of them, the sooner we look to our land forces the better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Shop will not be considered safe!&rsquo; said Beauchamp, taking in the
      telegram at a glance. &lsquo;Peppel&rsquo;s a first-rate officer too: she couldn&rsquo;t
      have had a better captain. Ship seriously damaged!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed back the paper to the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia expected him to say that he had foreseen such an event.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing; and with a singular contraction of the heart she
      recollected how he had denounced our system of preparing mainly for the
      defensive in war, on a day when they stood together in the park, watching
      the slow passage of that very ship, the Hastings, along the broad water,
      distant below them. The &lsquo;swarms of swift vessels of attack,&rsquo; she
      recollected particularly, and &lsquo;small wasps and rams under mighty
      steam-power,&rsquo; that he used to harp on when declaring that England must be
      known for the assailant in war: she was to &lsquo;ray out&rsquo; her worrying fleets.
      &lsquo;The defensive is perilous policy in war&rsquo;: he had said it. She recollected
      also her childish ridicule of his excess of emphasis: he certainly had
      foresight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Austin and Mr. Tuckham came strolling in conversation round the house
      to the terrace. Beauchamp bowed to the former, nodded to the latter,
      scrutinizing him after he had done so, as if the flash of a thought were
      in his mind. Tuckham&rsquo;s radiant aspect possibly excited it: &lsquo;Congratulate
      me!&rsquo; was the honest outcry of his face and frame. He was as over-flowingly
      rosy as a victorious candidate at the hustings commencing a speech.
      Cecilia laid her hand on an urn, in dread of the next words from either of
      the persons present. Her father put an arm in hers, and leaned on her. She
      gazed at her chamber window above, wishing to be wafted thither to her
      seclusion within. The trembling limbs of physical irresoluteness was a new
      experience to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anything else in the paper, colonel? I&rsquo;ve not seen it to-day,&rsquo; said
      Beauchamp, for the sake of speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything,&rsquo; Colonel Halkett replied. &lsquo;Our
      diplomatists haven&rsquo;t been shining much: that &lsquo;s not our forte.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No: it&rsquo;s our field for younger sons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it? Ah! There&rsquo;s an expedition against the hilltribes in India, and
      we&rsquo;re such a peaceful nation, eh? We look as if we were in for a
      complication with China.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir, we must sell our opium.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course we must. There&rsquo;s a man writing about surrendering Gibraltar!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we can&rsquo;t do that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But where do you draw the line?&rsquo; quoth Tuckham, very susceptible to a
      sneer at the colonel, and entirely ignorant of the circumstances attending
      Beauchamp&rsquo;s position before him. &lsquo;You defend the Chinaman; and it&rsquo;s
      questionable if his case is as good as the Spaniard&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Chinaman has a case against our traders. Gibraltar concerns our
      imperial policy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As to the case against the English merchants, the Chinaman is for
      shutting up his millions of acres of productive land, and the action of
      commerce is merely a declaration of a universal public right, to which all
      States must submit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Immorality brings its punishment, be sure of that. Some day we shall have
      enough of China. As to the Rock, I know the argument; I may be wrong. I&rsquo;ve
      had the habit of regarding it as necessary to our naval supremacy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come! there we agree.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not so certain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The counter-argument, I call treason.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s a broad policy, and a narrow. There&rsquo;s the
      Spanish view of the matter&mdash;if you are for peace and harmony and
      disarmament.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then strengthen your forces.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit of it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then bully the feeble and truckle to the strong; consent to be hated till
      you have to stand your ground.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Talk!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems to me logical.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the French notion&mdash;c&rsquo;est lodgique!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuckham&rsquo;s pronunciation caused Cecilia to level her eyes at him passingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the way,&rsquo; said Colonel Halkett, &lsquo;there are lots of horrors in the
      paper to-day; wife kickings, and starvations&mdash;oh, dear me! and the
      murder of a woman: two columns to that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That, the Tory reaction is responsible for!&rsquo; said Tuckham, rather by way
      of a joke than a challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp accepted it as a challenge. Much to the benevolent amusement of
      Mr. Austin and Colonel Halkett, he charged the responsibility of every
      crime committed in the country, and every condition of misery, upon the
      party which declined to move in advance, and which therefore apologized
      for the perpetuation of knavery, villany, brutality, injustice, and foul
      dealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stick to your laws and systems and institutions, and so long as you won&rsquo;t
      stir to amend them, I hold you accountable for that long newspaper list
      daily.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He said this with a visible fire of conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuckham stood bursting at the monstrousness of such a statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      He condensed his indignant rejoinder to: &lsquo;Madness can&rsquo;t go farther!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s an idea in it,&rsquo; said Mr. Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s an idea foaming at the mouth, then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps it has no worse fault than that of not marching parallel with the
      truth,&rsquo; said Mr. Austin, smiling. &lsquo;The party accusing in those terms ...
      what do you say, Captain Beauchamp?&mdash;supposing us to be pleading
      before a tribunal?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp admitted as much as that he had made the case gigantic, though
      he stuck to his charge against the Tory party. And moreover: the
      Tories-and the old Whigs, now Liberals, ranked under the heading of Tories&mdash;those
      Tories possessing and representing the wealth of the country, yet had not
      started one respectable journal that a lady could read through without
      offence to her, or a gentleman without disgust! If there was not one
      English newspaper in existence independent of circulation and
      advertisements, and of the tricks to win them, the Tories were answerable
      for the vacancy. They, being the rich who, if they chose, could set an
      example to our Press by subscribing to maintain a Journal superior to the
      flattering of vile appetites&mdash;&lsquo;all that nauseous matter,&rsquo; Beauchamp
      stretched his fingers at the sheets Colonel Halkett was holding, and which
      he had not read&mdash;&lsquo;those Tories,&rsquo; he bowed to the colonel, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
      I must say you, sir, are answerable for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very well satisfied with my paper,&rsquo; said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp sighed to himself. &lsquo;We choose to be satisfied,&rsquo; he said. His
      pure and mighty DAWN was in his thoughts: the unborn light of a day denied
      to earth!
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the doctors of Bevisham, visiting a sick maid of the house, trotted
      up the terrace to make his report to her master of the state of her
      health. He hoped to pull her through with the aid of high feeding. He
      alluded cursorily to a young girl living on the outskirts of the town,
      whom he had been called in to see at the eleventh hour, and had lost,
      owing to the lowering of his patient from a prescription of a vegetable
      diet by a certain Dr. Shrapnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      That ever-explosive name precipitated Beauchamp to the front rank of the
      defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I happen to be staying with Dr. Shrapnel,&rsquo; he observed. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t eat meat
      there because he doesn&rsquo;t, and I am certain I take no harm by avoiding it.
      I think vegetarianism a humaner system, and hope it may be wise. I should
      like to set the poor practising it, for their own sakes; and I have half
      an opinion that it would be good for the rich&mdash;if we are to condemn
      gluttony.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah? Captain Beauchamp!&rsquo; the doctor bowed to him. &lsquo;But my case was one of
      poor blood requiring to be strengthened. The girl was allowed to sink so
      low that stimulants were ineffective when I stepped in. There&rsquo;s the point.
      It &lsquo;s all very well while you are in health. You may do without meat till
      your system demands the stimulant, or else&mdash;as with this poor girl!
      And, indeed, Captain Beauchamp, if I may venture the remark&mdash;I had
      the pleasure of seeing you during the last Election in our town&mdash;and
      if I may be so bold, I should venture to hint that the avoidance of animal
      food&mdash;to judge by appearances&mdash;has not been quite wholesome for
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Eyes were turned on Beauchamp.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVIII. OF THE TRIAL AWAITING THE EARL OF ROMFREY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cecilia softly dropped her father&rsquo;s arm, and went into the house. The
      exceeding pallor of Beauchamp&rsquo;s face haunted her in her room. She heard
      the controversy proceeding below, and an exclamation of Blackburn
      Tuckham&rsquo;s: &lsquo;Immorality of meat-eating? What nonsense are they up to now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp was inaudible, save in a word or two. As usual, he was the
      solitary minority.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how mournfully changed he was! She had not noticed it, agitated by her
      own emotions as she had been, and at one time three parts frozen. He was
      the ghost of the Nevil Beauchamp who had sprung on the deck of the
      Esperanza out of Lieutenant Wilmore&rsquo;s boat, that sunny breezy day which
      was the bright first chapter of her new life&mdash;of her late life, as it
      seemed to her now, for she was dead to it, and another creature, the
      coldest of the women of earth. She felt sensibly cold, coveted warmth,
      flung a shawl on her shoulders, and sat in a corner of her room, hidden
      and shivering beside the open window, till long after the gentlemen had
      ceased to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      How much he must have suffered of late! The room she had looked to as a
      refuge from Nevil was now her stronghold against the man whom she had
      incredibly accepted. She remained there, the victim of a heart malady,
      under the term of headache. Feeling entrapped, she considered that she
      must have been encircled and betrayed. She looked back on herself as a
      giddy figure falling into a pit: and in the pit she lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how vile to have suspected of unfaithfulness and sordidness the
      generous and stedfast man of earth! He never abandoned a common
      friendship. His love of his country was love still, whatever the form it
      had taken. His childlike reliance on effort and outspeaking, for which men
      laughed at him, was beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where am I? she cried amid her melting images of him, all dominated by his
      wan features. She was bound fast, imprisoned and a slave. Even Mr. Austin
      had conspired against him: for only she read Nevil justly. His defence of
      Dr. Shrapnel filled her with an envy that no longer maligned the object of
      it, but was humble, and like the desire of the sick to creep into
      sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only worthy thing she could think of doing was (it must be mentioned
      for a revelation of her fallen state, and, moreover, she was not lusty of
      health at the moment) to abjure meat. The body loathed it, and
      consequently the mind of the invalided lady shrank away in horror of the
      bleeding joints, and the increasingly fierce scramble of Christian souls
      for the dismembered animals: she saw the innocent pasturing beasts, she
      saw the act of slaughter. She had actually sweeping before her sight a
      spectacle of the ludicrous-terrific, in the shape of an entire community
      pursuing countless herds of poor scampering animal life for blood: she,
      meanwhile, with Nevil and Dr. Shrapnel, stood apart contemning. For whoso
      would not partake of flesh in this kingdom of roast beef must be of the
      sparse number of Nevil&rsquo;s execrated minority in politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The example will show that she touched the borders of delirium.
      Physically, the doctor pronounces her bilious. She was in earnest so far
      as to send down to the library for medical books, and books upon diet.
      These, however, did not plead for the beasts. They treated the subject
      without question of man&rsquo;s taking that which he has conquered. Poets and
      philosophers did the same. Again she beheld Nevil Beauchamp solitary in
      the adverse rank to the world;&mdash;to his countrymen especially. But
      that it was no material cause which had wasted his cheeks and lined his
      forehead, she was sure: and to starve with him, to embark with him in his
      little boat on the seas he whipped to frenzy, would have been a dream of
      bliss, had she dared to contemplate herself in a dream as his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not to be thought of.
    </p>
    <p>
      No: but this was, and to be thought of seriously: Cecilia had said to
      herself for consolation that Beauchamp was no spiritual guide; he had her
      heart within her to plead for him, and the reflection came to her, like a
      bubble up from the heart, that most of our spiritual guides neglect the
      root to trim the flower: and thence, turning sharply on herself, she
      obtained a sudden view of her allurement and her sin in worshipping
      herself, and recognized that the aim at an ideal life closely approaches,
      or easily inclines, to self-worship; to which the lady was woman and
      artist enough to have had no objection, but that therein visibly she
      discerned the retributive vain longings, in the guise of high individual
      superiority and distinction, that had thwarted her with Nevil Beauchamp,
      never permitting her to love single-mindedly or whole-heartedly, but
      always in reclaiming her rights and sighing for the loss of her ideal;
      adoring her own image, in fact, when she pretended to cherish, and regret
      that she could not sufficiently cherish, the finer elements of nature.
      What was this ideal she had complained of losing? It was a broken mirror:
      she could think of it in no other form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ego-Ego&rsquo; yelped and gave chase to her through the pure
      beatitudes of her earlier days down to her present regrets. It hunted all
      the saints in the calendar till their haloes top-sided on their heads-her
      favourite St. Francis of Assisi excepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was called up from Bevisham next day, and pronounced her
      bilious. He was humorous over Captain Beauchamp, who had gone to the
      parents of the dead girl, and gathered the information that they were a
      consumptive family, to vindicate Dr. Shrapnel. &lsquo;The very family to require
      strong nourishment,&rsquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia did not rest in her sick-room before, hunting through one book and
      another, she had found arguments on the contrary side; a waste of labour
      that heaped oppression on her chest, as with the world&rsquo;s weight.
      Apparently one had only to be in Beauchamp&rsquo;s track to experience that. She
      horrified her father by asking questions about consumption. Homoeopathy,
      hydropathy,&mdash;the revolutionaries of medicine attracted her. Blackburn
      Tuckham, a model for an elected lover who is not beloved, promised to
      procure all sorts of treatises for her: no man could have been so
      deferential to a diseased mind. Beyond calling her by her Christian name,
      he did nothing to distress her with the broad aspect of their new
      relations together. He and Mr. Austin departed from Mount Laurels, leaving
      her to sink into an agreeable stupor, like one deposited on a mudbank
      after buffeting the waves. She learnt that her father had seen Captain
      Baskelett, and remembered, marvelling, how her personal dread of an
      interview, that threatened to compromise her ideal of her feminine and
      peculiar dignity, had assisted to precipitate her where she now lay
      helpless, almost inanimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was unaware of the passage of time save when her father spoke of a
      marriage-day. It told her that she lived and was moving. The fear of death
      is not stronger in us, nor the desire to put it off, than Cecilia&rsquo;s
      shunning of such a day. The naming of it numbed her blood like a
      snakebite. Yet she openly acknowledged her engagement; and, happily for
      Tuckham, his visits, both in London and at Mount Laurels, were few and
      short, and he inflicted no foretaste of her coming subjection to him to
      alarm her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under her air of calm abstraction she watched him rigorously for some sign
      of his ownership that should tempt her to revolt from her pledge, or at
      least dream of breaking loose: the dream would have sufficed. He was never
      intrusive, never pressing. He did not vex, because he absolutely trusted
      to the noble loyalty which made her admit to herself that she belonged
      irrevocably to him, while her thoughts were upon Beauchamp. With a
      respectful gravity he submitted to her perusal a collection of treatises
      on diet, classed pro and con., and paged and pencil-marked to simplify her
      study of the question. They sketched in company; she played music to him,
      he read poetry to her, and read it well. He seemed to feel the beauty of
      it sensitively, as she did critically. In other days the positions had
      been reversed. He invariably talked of Beauchamp with kindness, deploring
      only that he should be squandering his money on workmen&rsquo;s halls and other
      hazy projects down in Bevisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lydiard tells me he has a very sound idea of the value of money, and has
      actually made money by cattle breeding; but he has flung ten thousand
      pounds on a single building outside the town, and he&rsquo;ll have to endow it
      to support it&mdash;a Club to educate Radicals. The fact is, he wants to
      jam the business of two or three centuries into a life-time. These men of
      their so-called progress are like the majority of religious minds: they
      can&rsquo;t believe without seeing and touching. That is to say, they don&rsquo;t
      believe in the abstract at all, but they go to work blindly by agitating,
      and proselytizing, and persecuting to get together a mass they can believe
      in. You see it in their way of arguing; it&rsquo;s half done with the fist.
      Lydiard tells me he left him last in a horrible despondency about
      progress. Ha! ha! Beauchamp&rsquo;s no Radical. He hasn&rsquo;t forgiven the Countess
      of Romfrey for marrying above her rank. He may be a bit of a Republican:
      but really in this country Republicans are fighting with the shadow of an
      old hat and a cockhorse. I beg to state that I have a reverence for
      constituted authority: I speak of what those fellows are contending with.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Right,&rsquo; said Colonel Halkett. &lsquo;But &ldquo;the shadow of an old hat and a
      cockhorse&rdquo;: what does that mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what our Republicans are hitting at, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! so; yes,&rsquo; quoth the colonel. &lsquo;And I say this to Nevil Beauchamp, that
      what we&rsquo;ve grown up well with, powerfully with, it&rsquo;s base ingratitude and
      dangerous folly to throw over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He blamed Beauchamp for ingratitude to the countess, who had, he affirmed
      of his own knowledge, married Lord Romfrey to protect Beauchamp&rsquo;s
      interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      A curious comment on this allegation was furnished by the announcement of
      the earl&rsquo;s expectations of a son and heir. The earl wrote to Colonel
      Halkett from Romfrey Castle inviting him to come and spend some time
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, that&rsquo;s brave news!&rsquo; the colonel exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He proposed a cruise round by the Cornish coast to the Severn, and so to
      Romfrey Castle, to squeeze the old lord&rsquo;s hand and congratulate him with
      all his heart. Cecilia was glad to acquiesce, for an expedition of any
      description was a lull in the storm that hummed about her ears in the
      peace of home, where her father would perpetually speak of the day to be
      fixed. Sailing the sea on a cruise was like the gazing at wonderful
      colours of a Western sky: an oblivion of earthly dates and obligations.
      What mattered it that there were gales in August? She loved the sea, and
      the stinging salt spray, and circling gull and plunging gannet, the sun on
      the waves, and the torn cloud. The revelling libertine open sea wedded her
      to Beauchamp in that veiled cold spiritual manner she could muse on as a
      circumstance out of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fair companies of racing yachts were left behind. The gales of August
      mattered frightfully to poor Blackburn Tuckham, who was to be dropped at a
      town in South Wales, and descended greenish to his cabin as soon as they
      had crashed on the first wall-waves of the chalk-race, a throw beyond the
      peaked cliffs edged with cormorants, and were really tasting sea. Cecilia
      reclined on deck, wrapped in shawl and waterproof. As the Alpine climber
      claims the upper air, she had the wild sea to herself through her love of
      it; quite to herself. It was delicious to look round and ahead, and the
      perturbation was just enough to preserve her from thoughts too deep inward
      in a scene where the ghost of Nevil was abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hard dry gale increased. Her father, stretched beside her, drew her
      attention to a small cutter under double-reefed main-sail and small jib on
      the Esperanza&rsquo;s weather bow&mdash;a gallant boat carefully handled. She
      watched it with some anxiety, but the Esperanza was bound for a Devon bay,
      and bore away from the black Dorsetshire headland, leaving the little
      cutter to run into haven if she pleased. The passing her was no event.&mdash;In
      a representation of the common events befalling us in these times, upon an
      appreciation of which this history depends, one turns at whiles a
      languishing glance toward the vast potential mood, pluperfect tense. For
      Nevil Beauchamp was on board the cutter, steering her, with Dr. Shrapnel
      and Lydiard in the well, and if an accident had happened to cutter or
      schooner, what else might not have happened? Cecilia gathered it from Mrs.
      Wardour-Devereux, whom, to her surprise and pleasure, she found at Romfrey
      Castle. Her friend Louise received a letter from Mr. Lydiard, containing a
      literary amateur seaman&rsquo;s log of a cruise of a fifteen-ton cutter in a
      gale, and a pure literary sketch of Beauchamp standing drenched at the
      helm from five in the morning up to nine at night, munching a biscuit for
      nourishment. The beautiful widow prepared the way for what was very soon
      to be publicly known concerning herself by reading out this passage of her
      correspondent&rsquo;s letter in the breakfast room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, the fellow&rsquo;s a sailor!&rsquo; said Lord Romfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The countess rose from her chair and walked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, was that abuse of the fellow?&rsquo; the old lord asked Colonel Halkett.
      &lsquo;I said he was a sailor, I said nothing else. He is a sailor, and he&rsquo;s fit
      for nothing else, and no ship will he get unless he bends his neck never
      &lsquo;s nearer it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated a moment, and went after his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia sat with the countess, in the afternoon, at a window overlooking
      the swelling woods of Romfrey. She praised the loveliness of the view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is fire to me,&rsquo; said Rosamund.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia looked at her, startled. Rosamund said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was an excellent hostess, nevertheless, unpretending and simple in
      company; and only when it chanced that Beauchamp&rsquo;s name was mentioned did
      she cast that quick supplicating nervous glance at the earl, with a shadow
      of an elevation of her shoulders, as if in apprehension of mordant pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will make no mystery about it. I would I could. Those happy tales of
      mystery are as much my envy as the popular narratives of the deeds of
      bread and cheese people, for they both create a tide-way in the attentive
      mind; the mysterious pricking our credulous flesh to creep, the familiar
      urging our obese imagination to constitutional exercise. And oh, the
      refreshment there is in dealing with characters either contemptibly
      beneath us or supernaturally above! My way is like a Rhone island in the
      summer drought, stony, unattractive and difficult between the two forceful
      streams of the unreal and the over-real, which delight mankind&mdash;honour
      to the conjurors! My people conquer nothing, win none; they are actual,
      yet uncommon. It is the clock-work of the brain that they are directed to
      set in motion, and&mdash;poor troop of actors to vacant benches!&mdash;the
      conscience residing in thoughtfulness which they would appeal to; and if
      you are there impervious to them, we are lost: back I go to my wilderness,
      where, as you perceive, I have contracted the habit of listening to my own
      voice more than is good: The burden of a child in her bosom had come upon
      Rosamund with the visage of the Angel of Death fronting her in her path.
      She believed that she would die; but like much that we call belief, there
      was a kernel of doubt in it, which was lively when her frame was
      enlivened, and she then thought of the giving birth to this unloved child,
      which was to disinherit the man she loved, in whose interest solely (so
      she could presume to think, because it had been her motive reason) she had
      married the earl. She had no wish to be a mother; but that prospect, and
      the dread attaching to it at her time of life, she could have submitted to
      for Lord Romfrey&rsquo;s sake. It struck her like a scoffer&rsquo;s blow that she, the
      one woman on earth loving Nevil, should have become the instrument for
      dispossessing him. The revulsion of her feelings enlightened her so far as
      to suggest, without enabling her to fathom him, that instead of having
      cleverly swayed Lord Romfrey, she had been his dupe, or a blind
      accomplice; and though she was too humane a woman to think of punishing
      him, she had so much to forgive that the trifles daily and at any instant
      added to the load, flushed her resentment, like fresh lights showing new
      features and gigantic outlines. Nevil&rsquo;s loss of Cecilia she had
      anticipated; she had heard of it when she was lying in physical and mental
      apathy at Steynham. Lord Romfrey had repeated to her the nature of his
      replies to the searching parental questions of Colonel Halkett, and having
      foreseen it all, and what was more, foretold it, she was not aroused from
      her torpor. Latterly, with the return of her natural strength, she had
      shown herself incapable of hearing her husband speak of Nevil; nor was the
      earl tardy in taking the hint to spare the mother of his child allusions
      that vexed her. Now and then they occurred perforce. The presence of
      Cecilia exasperated Rosamund&rsquo;s peculiar sensitiveness. It required Louise
      Wardour-Devereux&rsquo;s apologies and interpretations to account for what
      appeared to Cecilia strangely ill-conditioned, if not insane, in Lady
      Romfrey&rsquo;s behaviour. The most astonishing thing to hear was, that Lady
      Romfrey had paid Mrs. Devereux a visit at her Surrey house unexpectedly
      one Sunday in the London season, for the purpose, as it became evident, of
      meeting Mr. Blackburn Tuckham: and how she could have known that Mr.
      Tuckham would be there, Mrs. Devereux could not tell, for it was, Louise
      assured Cecilia, purely by chance that he and Mr. Lydiard were present:
      but the countess obtained an interview with him alone, and Mr. Tuckham
      came from it declaring it to have been more terrible than any he had ever
      been called upon to endure. The object of the countess was to persuade him
      to renounce his bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louise replied to the natural inquiry&mdash;&lsquo;Upon what plea?&rsquo; with a
      significant evasiveness. She put her arms round Cecilia&rsquo;s neck: &lsquo;I trust
      you are not unhappy. You will get no release from him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not unhappy,&rsquo; said Cecilia, musically clear to convince her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was indeed glad to feel the stout chains of her anchor restraining her
      when Lady Romfrey talked of Nevil; they were like the safety of marriage
      without the dreaded ceremony, and with solitude to let her weep. Bound
      thus to a weaker man than Blackburn Tuckham, though he had been more
      warmly esteemed, her fancy would have drifted away over the deeps, perhaps
      her cherished loyalty would have drowned in her tears&mdash;for Lady
      Romfrey tasked it very severely: but he from whom she could hope for no
      release, gave her some of the firmness which her nature craved in this
      trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      From saying quietly to her: &lsquo;I thought once you loved him,&rsquo; when alluding
      to Nevil, Lady Romfrey passed to mournful exclamations, and by degrees on
      to direct entreaties. She related the whole story of Renee in England, and
      appeared distressed with a desperate wonderment at Cecilia&rsquo;s mildness
      after hearing it. Her hearer would have imagined that she had no moral
      sense, if it had not been so perceptible that the poor lady&rsquo;s mind was
      distempered on the one subject of Nevil Beauchamp. Cecilia&rsquo;s high
      conception of duty, wherein she was a peerless flower of our English
      civilization, was incommunicable: she could practise, not explain it. She
      bowed to Lady Romfrey&rsquo;s praises of Nevil, suffered her hands to be wrung,
      her heart to be touched, all but an avowal of her love of him to be
      wrested from her, and not the less did she retain her cold resolution to
      marry to please her father and fulfil her pledge. In truth, it was too
      late to speak of Renee to her now. It did not beseem Cecilia to remember
      that she had ever been a victim of jealousy; and while confessing to many
      errors, because she felt them, and gained a necessary strength from them&mdash;in
      the comfort of the consciousness of pain, for example, which she sorely
      needed, that the pain in her own breast might deaden her to Nevil&rsquo;s
      jealousy, the meanest of the errors of a lofty soul, yielded no extract
      beyond the bare humiliation proper to an acknowledgement that it had
      existed: so she discarded the recollection of the passion which had
      wrought the mischief. Since we cannot have a peerless flower of
      civilization without artificial aid, it may be understood how it was that
      Cecilia could extinguish some lights in her mind and kindle others, and
      wherefore what it was not natural for her to do, she did. She had,
      briefly, a certain control of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our common readings in the fictitious romances which mark out a plot and
      measure their characters to fit into it, had made Rosamund hopeful of the
      effect of that story of Renee. A wooden young woman, or a galvanized
      (sweet to the writer, either of them, as to the reader&mdash;so moveable
      they are!) would have seen her business at this point, and have glided
      melting to reconciliation and the chamber where romantic fiction ends
      joyously. Rosamund had counted on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked intently at Cecilia. &lsquo;He is ruined, wasted, ill, unloved; he
      has lost you&mdash;I am the cause!&rsquo; she cried in a convulsion of grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Lady Romfrey!&rsquo; Cecilia would have consoled her. &lsquo;There is nothing to
      lead us to suppose that Nevil is unwell, and you are not to blame for
      anything: how can you be?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I spoke falsely of Dr. Shrapnel; I am the cause. It lies on me! it
      pursues me. Let me give to the poor as I may, and feel for the poor, as I
      do, to get nearer to Nevil&mdash;I cannot have peace! His heart has turned
      from me. He despises me. If I had spoken to Lord Romfrey at Steynham, as
      he commanded me, you and he&mdash;Oh! cowardice: he is right, cowardice is
      the chief evil in the world. He is ill; he is desperately ill; he will
      die.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you heard he is very ill, Lady Romfrey?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No! no!&rsquo; Rosamund exclaimed; &lsquo;it is by not hearing that I know it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With the assistance of Louise Devereux, Cecilia gradually awakened to what
      was going on in the house. There had been a correspondence between Miss
      Denham and the countess. Letters from Bevisham had suddenly ceased.
      Presumably the earl had stopped them: and if so it must have been for a
      tragic reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia hinted some blame of Lord Romfrey to her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her hand and said: &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know what that man suffers.
      Romfrey is fond of Nevil too, but he must guard his wife; and the fact is
      Nevil is down with fever. It &lsquo;s in the papers now; he may be able to
      conceal it, and I hope he will. There&rsquo;ll be a crisis, and then he can tell
      her good news&mdash;a little illness and all right now! Of course,&rsquo; the
      colonel continued buoyantly, &lsquo;Nevil will recover; he&rsquo;s a tough wiry young
      fellow, but poor Romfrey&rsquo;s fears are natural enough about the countess.
      Her mind seems to be haunted by the doctor there&mdash;Shrapnel, I mean;
      and she&rsquo;s exciteable to a degree that threatens the worst&mdash;in case of
      any accident in Bevisham.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it not a kind of cowardice to conceal it?&rsquo; Cecilia suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It saves her from fretting,&rsquo; said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But she is fretting! If Lord Romfrey would confide in her and trust to
      her courage, papa, it would be best.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett thought that Lord Romfrey was the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia wished to leave a place where this visible torture of a human soul
      was proceeding, and to no purpose. She pointed out to her father, by a
      variety of signs, that Lady Romfrey either knew or suspected the state of
      affairs in Bevisham, and repeated her remarks upon Nevil&rsquo;s illness. But
      Colonel Halkett was restrained from departing by the earl&rsquo;s constant
      request to him to stay. Old friendship demanded it of him. He began to
      share his daughter&rsquo;s feelings at the sight of Lady Romfrey. She was
      outwardly patient and submissive; by nature she was a strong healthy
      woman; and she attended to all her husband&rsquo;s prescriptions for the
      regulating of her habits, walked with him, lay down for the afternoon&rsquo;s
      rest, appeared amused when he laboured to that effect, and did her utmost
      to subdue the worm devouring her heart but the hours of the delivery of
      the letter-post were fatal to her. Her woeful: &lsquo;No letter for me!&rsquo; was
      piteous. When that was heard no longer, her silence and famished gaze
      chilled Cecilia. At night Rosamund eyed her husband expressionlessly, with
      her head leaning back in her chair, to the sorrow of the ladies beholding
      her. Ultimately the contagion of her settled misery took hold of Cecilia.
      Colonel Halkett was induced by his daughter and Mrs. Devereux to endeavour
      to combat a system that threatened consequences worse than those it was
      planned to avert. He by this time was aware of the serious character of
      the malady which had prostrated Nevil. Lord Romfrey had directed his own
      medical man to go down to Bevisham, and Dr. Gannet&rsquo;s report of Nevil was
      grave. The colonel made light of it to his daughter, after the fashion he
      condemned in Lord Romfrey, to whom however he spoke earnestly of the
      necessity for partially taking his wife into his confidence to the extent
      of letting her know that a slight fever was running its course with Nevil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There will be no slight fever in my wife&rsquo;s blood,&rsquo; said the earl. &lsquo;I
      stand to weather the cape or run to wreck, and it won&rsquo;t do to be taking in
      reefs on a lee-shore. You don&rsquo;t see what frets her, colonel. For years she
      has been bent on Nevil&rsquo;s marriage. It&rsquo;s off: but if you catch Cecilia by
      the hand and bring her to us&mdash;I swear she loves the fellow!&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      the medicine for my wife. Say: will you do it? Tell Lady Romfrey it shall
      be done. We shall stand upright again!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s impossible, Romfrey,&rsquo; said the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Play at it, then! Let her think it. You&rsquo;re helping me treat an invalid.
      Colonel! my old friend! You save my house and name if you do that. It&rsquo;s a
      hand round a candle in a burst of wind. There&rsquo;s Nevil dragged by a woman
      into one of their reeking hovels&mdash;so that Miss Denham at Shrapnel&rsquo;s
      writes to Lady Romfrey&mdash;because the woman&rsquo;s drunken husband voted for
      him at the Election, and was kicked out of employment, and fell upon the
      gin-bottle, and the brats of the den died starving, and the man sickened
      of a fever; and Nevil goes in and sits with him! Out of that tangle of
      folly is my house to be struck down? It looks as if the fellow with his
      infernal &ldquo;humanity,&rdquo; were the bad genius of an old nurse&rsquo;s tale. He&rsquo;s a
      good fellow, colonel, he means well. This fever will cure him, they say it
      sobers like bloodletting. He&rsquo;s a gallant fellow; you know that. He fought
      to the skeleton in our last big war. On my soul, I believe he&rsquo;s good for a
      husband. Frenchwoman or not, that affair&rsquo;s over. He shall have Steynham
      and Holdesbury. Can I say more? Now, colonel, you go in to the countess.
      Grasp my hand. Give me that help, and God bless you! You light up my old
      days. She&rsquo;s a noble woman: I would not change her against the best in the
      land. She has this craze about Nevil. I suppose she&rsquo;ll never get over it.
      But there it is: and we must feed her with the spoon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett argued stutteringly with the powerful man: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the truth
      she ought to hear, Romfrey; indeed it is, if you &lsquo;ll believe me. It &lsquo;s his
      life she is fearing for. She knows half.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She knows positively nothing, colonel. Miss Denham&rsquo;s first letter spoke
      of the fellow&rsquo;s having headaches, and staggering. He was out on a cruise,
      and saw your schooner pass, and put into some port, and began falling
      right and left, and they got him back to Shrapnel&rsquo;s: and here it is&mdash;that
      if you go to him you&rsquo;ll save him, and if you go to my wife you&rsquo;ll save
      her: and there you have it: and I ask my old friend, I beg him to go to
      them both.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you can&rsquo;t surely expect me to force my daughter&rsquo;s inclinations, my
      dear Romfrey?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cecilia loves the fellow!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is engaged to Mr. Tuckham.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see the man Tuckham.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really, my dear lord!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Play at it, Halkett, play at it! Tide us over this! Talk to her: hint it
      and nod it. We have to round November. I could strangle the world till
      that month&rsquo;s past. You&rsquo;ll own,&rsquo; he added mildly after his thunder, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      not much of the despot Nevil calls me. She has not a wish I don&rsquo;t supply.
      I&rsquo;m at her beck, and everything that&rsquo;s mine. She&rsquo;s a brave good woman. I
      don&rsquo;t complain. I run my chance. But if we lose the child&mdash;good
      night! Boy or girl!&mdash;boy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey flung an arm up. The child of his old age lived for him
      already: he gave it all the life he had. This miracle, this young son
      springing up on an earth decaying and dark, absorbed him. This reviver of
      his ancient line must not be lost. Perish every consideration to avert it!
      He was ready to fear, love, or hate terribly, according to the prospects
      of his child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett was obliged to enter into a consultation, of a shadowy
      sort, with his daughter, whose only advice was that they should leave the
      castle. The penetrable gloom there, and the growing apprehension
      concerning the countess and Nevil, tore her to pieces. Even if she could
      have conspired with the earl to hoodwink his wife, her strong sense told
      her it would be fruitless, besides base. Father and daughter had to make
      the stand against Lord Romfrey. He saw their departure from the castle
      gates, and kissed his hand to Cecilia, courteously, without a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He may well praise the countess, papa,&rsquo; said Cecilia, while they were
      looking back at the castle and the moveless flag that hung in folds by the
      mast above it. &lsquo;She has given me her promise to avoid questioning him and
      to accept his view of her duty. She said to me that if Nevil should die
      she...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia herself broke down, and gave way to sobs in her father&rsquo;s arms.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIX. A FABRIC OF BARONIAL DESPOTISM CRUMBLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The earl&rsquo;s precautions did duty night and day in all the avenues leading
      to the castle and his wife&rsquo;s apartments; and he could believe that he had
      undertaken as good a defence as the mountain guarding the fertile vale
      from storms: but him the elements pelted heavily. Letters from
      acquaintances of Nevil, from old shipmates and from queer political
      admirers and opponents, hailed on him; things not to be frigidly read were
      related of the fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey&rsquo;s faith in the power of constitution to beat disease battled
      sturdily with the daily reports of his physician and friends, whom he had
      directed to visit the cottage on the common outside Bevisham, and with
      Miss Denham&rsquo;s intercepted letters to the countess. Still he had to
      calculate on the various injuries Nevil had done to his constitution,
      which had made of him another sort of man for a struggle of life and death
      than when he stood like a riddled flag through the war. That latest freak
      of the fellow&rsquo;s, the abandonment of our natural and wholesome sustenance
      in animal food, was to be taken in the reckoning. Dr. Gannet did not
      allude to it; the Bevisham doctor did; and the earl meditated with a fury
      of wrath on the dismal chance that such a folly as this of one old
      vegetable idiot influencing a younger noodle, might strike his House to
      the dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      His watch over his wife had grown mechanical: he failed to observe that
      her voice was missing. She rarely spoke. He lost the art of observing
      himself: the wrinkling up and dropping of his brows became his habitual
      language. So long as he had not to meet inquiries or face tears, he
      enjoyed the sense of security. He never quitted his wife save to walk to
      the Southern park lodge, where letters and telegrams were piled awaiting
      him; and she was forbidden to take the air on the castle terrace without
      his being beside her, lest a whisper, some accident of the kind that
      donkeys who nod over their drowsy nose-length-ahead precautions call
      fatality, should rouse her to suspect, and in a turn of the hand undo his
      labour: for the race was getting terrible: Death had not yet stepped out
      of that evil chamber in Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s cottage to aim his javelin at the
      bosom containing the prized young life to come, but, like the smoke of
      waxing fire, he shadowed forth his presence in wreaths blacker and thicker
      day by day: and Everard Romfrey knew that the hideous beast of darkness
      had only to spring up and pass his guard to deal a blow to his House the
      direr from all he supposed himself to have gained by masking it hitherto.
      The young life he looked to for renewal swallowed him: he partly lost
      human feeling for his wife in the tremendous watch and strain to hurry her
      as a vessel round the dangerous headland. He was oblivious that his
      eyebrows talked, that his head was bent low, that his mouth was shut, and
      that where a doubt had been sown, silence and such signs are like
      revelations in black night to the spirit of a woman who loves.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning after breakfast Rosamund hung on his arm, eyeing him neither
      questioningly nor invitingly, but long. He kissed her forehead. She clung
      to him and closed her eyes, showing him a face of slumber, like a mask of
      the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Devereux was present. Cecilia had entreated her to stay with Lady
      Romfrey. She stole away, for the time had come which any close observer of
      the countess must have expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl lifted his wife, and carried her to her sitting-room. A sunless
      weltering September day whipped the window-panes and brought the roar of
      the beaten woods to her ears. He was booted and gaitered for his customary
      walk to the park lodge, and as he bent a knee beside her, she murmured:
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t wait; return soon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He placed a cord attached to the bellrope within her reach. This utter
      love of Nevil Beauchamp was beyond his comprehension, but there it was,
      and he had to submit to it and manoeuvre. His letters and telegrams told
      the daily tale. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s better,&rsquo; said the earl, preparing himself to answer
      what his wife&rsquo;s look had warned him would come.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was an image of peace, in the same posture on the couch where he had
      left her, when he returned. She did not open her eyes, but felt about for
      his hand, and touching it, she seemed to weigh the fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she said: &lsquo;The fever should be at its height.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, my dear brave girl, what ails you?&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ignorance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyelids. His head was bent down over her, like a raven&rsquo;s
      watching, a picture of gravest vigilance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her bosom rose and sank. &lsquo;What has Miss Denham written to-day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-day?&rsquo; he asked her gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall bear it,&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;You were my master before you were my
      husband. I bear anything you think is good for my government. Only, my
      ignorance is fever; I share Nevil&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you been to my desk at all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. I read your eyes and your hands: I have been living on them. To-day I
      find that I have not gained by it, as I hoped I should. Ignorance kills
      me. I really have courage to bear to hear just at this moment I have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no bad news, my love,&rsquo; said the earl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;High fever, is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The usual fever. Gannet&rsquo;s with him. I sent for Gannet to go there, to
      satisfy you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil is not dead?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord! ma&rsquo;am, my dear soul!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is alive?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite: certainly alive; as much alive as I am; only going a little
      faster, as fellows do in the jumps of a fever. The best doctor in England
      is by his bed. He &lsquo;s doing fairly. You should have let me know you were
      fretting, my Rosamund.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not wish to tempt you to lie, my dear lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, there are times when a woman... as you are: but you&rsquo;re a brave
      woman, a strong heart, and my wife. You want some one to sit with you,
      don&rsquo;t you? Louise Devereux is a pleasant person, but you want a man to
      amuse you. I&rsquo;d have sent to Stukely, but you want a serious man, I fancy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So much had the earl been thrown out of his plan for protecting his wife,
      that he felt helpless, and hinted at the aids and comforts of religion. He
      had not rejected the official Church, and regarding it now as in alliance
      with great Houses, he considered that its ministers might also be useful
      to the troubled women of noble families. He offered, if she pleased, to
      call in the rector to sit with her&mdash;the bishop of the diocese, if she
      liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But just as you like, my love,&rsquo; he added. &lsquo;You know you have to avoid
      fretting. I&rsquo;ve heard my sisters talk of the parson doing them good off and
      on about the time of their being brought to bed. He elevated their minds,
      they said. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve no objection. If he can doctor the minds of women
      he&rsquo;s got a profession worth something.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund smothered an outcry. &lsquo;You mean that Nevil is past hope!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not if he&rsquo;s got a fair half of our blood in him. And Richard Beauchamp
      gave the fellow good stock. He has about the best blood in England. That&rsquo;s
      not saying much when they&rsquo;ve taken to breed as they build&mdash;stuff to
      keep the plasterers at work; devil a thought of posterity!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There I see you and Nevil one, my dear lord,&rsquo; said Rosamund. &lsquo;You think
      of those that are to follow us. Talk to me of him. Do not say, &ldquo;the
      fellow.&rdquo; Say &ldquo;Nevil.&rdquo; No, no; call him &ldquo;the fellow.&rdquo; He was alive and well
      when you used to say it. But smile kindly, as if he made you love him down
      in your heart, in spite of you. We have both known that love, and that
      opposition to him; not liking his ideas, yet liking him so: we were
      obliged to laugh&mdash;I have seen you! as love does laugh! If I am not
      crying over his grave, Everard? Oh!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl smoothed her forehead. All her suspicions were rekindled. &lsquo;Truth!
      truth! give me truth. Let me know what world I am in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, a ship&rsquo;s not lost because she&rsquo;s caught in a squall; nor a man
      buffeting the waves for an hour. He&rsquo;s all right: he keeps up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is delirious? I ask you&mdash;I have fancied I heard him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey puffed from his nostrils: but in affecting to blow to the
      winds her foolish woman&rsquo;s wildness of fancy, his mind rested on Nevil, and
      he said: &lsquo;Poor boy! It seems he&rsquo;s chattering hundreds to the minute.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife&rsquo;s looks alarmed him after he had said it, and he was for toning
      it and modifying it, when she gasped to him to help her to her feet; and
      standing up, she exclaimed: &lsquo;O heaven! now I hear you; now I know he
      lives. See how much better it is for me to know the real truth. It takes
      me to his bedside. Ignorance and suspense have been poison. I have been
      washed about like a dead body. Let me read all my letters now. Nothing
      will harm me now. You will do your best for me, my husband, will you not?&rsquo; 
      She tore at her dress at her throat for coolness, panting and smiling.
      &lsquo;For me&mdash;us&mdash;yours&mdash;ours! Give me my letters, lunch with
      me, and start for Bevisham. Now you see how good it is for me to hear the
      very truth, you will give me your own report, and I shall absolutely trust
      in it, and go down with it if it&rsquo;s false! But you see I am perfectly
      strong for the truth. It must be you or I to go. I burn to go; but your
      going will satisfy me. If you look on him, I look. I feel as if I had been
      nailed down in a coffin, and have got fresh air. I pledge you my word,
      sir, my honour, my dear husband, that I will think first of my duty. I
      know it would be Nevil&rsquo;s wish. He has not quite forgiven me&mdash;he
      thought me ambitious&mdash;ah! stop: he said that the birth of our child
      would give him greater happiness than he had known for years: he begged me
      to persuade you to call a boy Nevil Beauchamp, and a girl Renee. He has
      never believed in his own long living.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund refreshed her lord&rsquo;s heart by smiling archly as she said: &lsquo;The
      boy to be educated to take the side of the people, of course! The girl is
      to learn a profession.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! bless the fellow!&rsquo; Lord Romfrey interjected. &lsquo;Well, I might go there
      for an hour. Promise me, no fretting! You have hollows in your cheeks, and
      your underlip hangs: I don&rsquo;t like it. I haven&rsquo;t seen that before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We do not see clearly when we are trying to deceive,&rsquo; said Rosamund. &lsquo;My
      letters! my letters!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey went to fetch them. They were intact in his desk. His wife,
      then, had actually been reading the facts through a wall! For he was
      convinced of Mrs. Devereux&rsquo;s fidelity, as well as of the colonel&rsquo;s and
      Cecilia&rsquo;s. He was not a man to be disobeyed: nor was his wife the woman to
      court or to acquiesce in trifling acts of disobedience to him. He received
      the impression, consequently, that this matter of the visit to Nevil was
      one in which the poor loving soul might be allowed to guide him, singular
      as the intensity of her love of Nevil Beauchamp was, considering that they
      were not of kindred blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He endeavoured to tone her mind for the sadder items in Miss Denham&rsquo;s
      letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Rosamund, &lsquo;what if I shed the &ldquo;screaming eyedrops,&rdquo; as you call
      them? They will not hurt me, but relieve. I was sure I should someday envy
      that girl! If he dies she will have nursed him and had the last of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s not going to die!&rsquo; said Everard powerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must be prepared. These letters will do that for me. I have written
      out the hours of your trains. Stanton will attend on you. I have directed
      him to telegraph to the Dolphin in Bevisham for rooms for the night: that
      is to-morrow night. To-night you sleep at your hotel in London, which will
      be ready to receive you, and is more comfortable than the empty house.
      Stanton takes wine, madeira and claret, and other small necessaries. If
      Nevil should be very unwell, you will not leave him immediately. I shall
      look to the supplies. You will telegraph to me twice a day, and write
      once. We lunch at half-past twelve, so that you may hit the
      twenty-minutes-to-two o&rsquo;clock train. And now I go to see that the packing
      is done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She carried off her letters to her bedroom, where she fell upon the bed,
      shutting her eyelids hard before she could suffer her eyes to be the
      intermediaries of that fever-chamber in Bevisham and her bursting heart.
      But she had not positively deceived her husband in the reassurance she had
      given him by her collectedness and by the precise directions she had
      issued for his comforts, indicating a mind so much more at ease. She was
      firmer to meet the peril of her beloved: and being indeed, when thrown on
      her internal resources, one among the brave women of earth, though also
      one who required a lift from circumstances to take her stand calmly
      fronting a menace to her heart, she saw the evidence of her influence with
      Lord Romfrey: the level she could feel that they were on together so long
      as she was courageous, inspirited her sovereignly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He departed at the hour settled for him. Rosamund sat at her boudoir
      window, watching the carriage that was conducting him to the railway
      station. Neither of them had touched on the necessity of his presenting
      himself at the door of Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s house. That, and the disgust
      belonging to it, was a secondary consideration with Lord Romfrey, after he
      had once resolved on it as the right thing to do: and his wife admired and
      respected him for so supreme a loftiness. And fervently she prayed that it
      might not be her evil fate to disappoint his hopes. Never had she
      experienced so strong a sense of devotedness to him as when she saw the
      carriage winding past the middle oak-wood of the park, under a wet sky
      brightened from the West, and on out of sight.

    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER L. AT THE COTTAGE ON THE COMMON
    </h2>
    <p>
      Rain went with Lord Romfrey in a pursuing cloud all the way to Bevisham,
      and across the common to the long garden and plain little green-shuttered,
      neat white cottage of Dr. Shrapnel. Carriages were driving from the door;
      idle men with hands deep in their pockets hung near it, some women
      pointing their shoulders under wet shawls, and boys. The earl was on foot.
      With no sign of discomposure, he stood at the half-open door and sent in
      his card, bearing the request for permission to visit his nephew. The
      reply failing to come to him immediately, he began striding to and fro.
      That garden gate where he had flourished the righteous whip was wide.
      Foot-farers over the sodden common were attracted to the gateway, and
      lingered in it, looking at the long, green-extended windows, apparently
      listening, before they broke away to exchange undertone speech here and
      there. Boys had pushed up through the garden to the kitchen area. From
      time to time a woman in a dripping bonnet whimpered aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      An air of a country churchyard on a Sunday morning when the curate has
      commenced the service prevailed. The boys were subdued by the moisture, as
      they are when they sit in the church aisle or organ-loft, before their
      members have been much cramped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole scene, and especially the behaviour of the boys, betokened to
      Lord Romfrey that an event had come to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the chronicle of a sickness the event is death.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bethought him of various means of stopping the telegraph and smothering
      the tale, if matters should have touched the worst here. He calculated
      abstrusely the practicable shortness of the two routes from Bevisham to
      Romfrey, by post-horses on the straightest line of road, or by express
      train on the triangle of railway, in case of an extreme need requiring him
      to hasten back to his wife and renew his paternal-despotic system with
      her. She had but persuaded him of the policy of a liberal openness and
      confidence for the moment&rsquo;s occasion: she could not turn his nature, which
      ran to strokes of craft and blunt decision whenever the emergency smote
      him and he felt himself hailed to show generalship.
    </p>
    <p>
      While thus occupied in thoughtfulness he became aware of the monotony of a
      tuneless chant, as if, it struck him, an insane young chorister or canon
      were galloping straight on end hippomaniacally through the Psalms. There
      was a creak at intervals, leading him to think it a machine that might
      have run away with the winder&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl&rsquo;s humour proposed the notion to him that this perhaps was one of
      the forms of Radical lamentation, ululation, possibly practised by a
      veteran impietist like Dr. Shrapnel for the loss of his youngster, his
      political cub&mdash;poor lad!
    </p>
    <p>
      Deriding any such paganry, and aught that could be set howling, Lord
      Romfrey was presently moved to ask of the small crowd at the gate what
      that sound was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the poor commander, sir,&rsquo; said a wet-shawled woman, shivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s been at it twenty hours already, sir,&rsquo; said one of the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Twenty-foor hour he &lsquo;ve been at it,&rsquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short dispute grew over the exact number of hours. One boy declared that
      thirty hours had been reached. &lsquo;Father heerd&rsquo;n yesterday morning as he was
      aff to &lsquo;s work in the town afore six: that brings &lsquo;t nigh thirty and he
      ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t stopped yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl was invited to step inside the gate, a little way up to the
      house, and under the commander&rsquo;s window, that he might obtain a better
      hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swung round, walked away, walked back, and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it was indeed a voice, the voice, he would have said, was travelling
      high in air along the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday he had described to his wife Nevil&rsquo;s chattering of hundreds to
      the minute. He had not realized the description, which had been only his
      manner of painting delirium: there had been no warrant for it. He heard
      the wild scudding voice imperfectly: it reminded him of a string of winter
      geese changeing waters. Shower gusts, and the wail and hiss of the rows of
      fir-trees bordering the garden, came between, and allowed him a moment&rsquo;s
      incredulity as to its being a human voice. Such a cry will often haunt the
      moors and wolds from above at nightfall. The voice hied on, sank, seemed
      swallowed; it rose, as if above water, in a hush of wind and trees. The
      trees bowed their heads rageing, the voice drowned; once more to rise,
      chattering thrice rapidly, in a high-pitched key, thin, shrill, weird,
      interminable, like winds through a crazy chamber-door at midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of a broomstick-witch in the clouds could not be thinner and
      stranger: Lord Romfrey had some such thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Gannet was the bearer of Miss Denham&rsquo;s excuses to Lord Romfrey for the
      delay in begging him to enter the house: in the confusion of the household
      his lordship&rsquo;s card had been laid on the table below, and she was in the
      sick-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is my nephew a dead man?&rsquo; said the earl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor weighed his reply. &lsquo;He lives. Whether he will, after the
      exhaustion of this prolonged fit of raving, I don&rsquo;t dare to predict. In
      the course of my experience I have never known anything like it. He lives:
      there&rsquo;s the miracle, but he lives.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On brandy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That would soon have sped him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha. You have everything here that you want?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s in your hands, Gannet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl was conducted to a sitting-room, where Dr. Gannet left him for a
      while.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mindful that he was under the roof of his enemy, he remained standing,
      observing nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice overheard was off at a prodigious rate, like the far sound of a
      yell ringing on and on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl unconsciously sought a refuge from it by turning the leaves of a
      book upon the table, which was a complete edition of Harry Denham&rsquo;s Poems,
      with a preface by a man named Lydiard; and really, to read the preface one
      would suppose that these poets were the princes of the earth. Lord Romfrey
      closed the volume. It was exquisitely bound, and presented to Miss Denham
      by the Mr. Lydiard. &lsquo;The works of your illustrious father,&rsquo; was written on
      the title-page. These writers deal queerly with their words of praise of
      one another. There is no law to restrain them. Perhaps it is the
      consolation they take for the poor devil&rsquo;s life they lead!
    </p>
    <p>
      A lady addressing him familiarly, invited him to go upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thanked her. At the foot of the stairs he turned; he had recognized
      Cecilia Halkett.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing her there was more strange to him than being there himself; but he
      bowed to facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer intelligibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crazed gabbling tongue had entire possession of the house, and rang
      through it at an amazing pitch to sustain for a single minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      A reflection to the effect that dogs die more decently than we men,
      saddened the earl. But, then, it is true, we shorten their pangs by
      shooting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dismal figure loomed above him at the head of the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He distinguished it in the vast lean length he had once whipped and flung
      to earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Shrapnel was planted against the wall outside that raving chamber, at
      the salient angle of a common prop or buttress. The edge of a shoulder and
      a heel were the supports to him sideways in his distorted attitude. His
      wall arm hung dead beside his pendent frock-coat; the hair of his head had
      gone to wildness, like a field of barley whipped by tempest. One hand
      pressed his eyeballs: his unshaven jaw dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey passed him by.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dumb consent of all present affirmed the creature lying on the bed to
      be Nevil Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Face, voice, lank arms, chicken neck: what a sepulchral sketch of him!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the revelry of a corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shudders of alarm for his wife seized Lord Romfrey at the sight. He
      thought the poor thing on the bed must be going, resolving to a cry,
      unwinding itself violently in its hurricane of speech, that was not speech
      nor exclamation, rather the tongue let loose to run to the death. It
      seemed to be out in mid-sea, up wave and down wave.
    </p>
    <p>
      A nurse was at the pillow smoothing it. Miss Denham stood at the foot of
      the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that pain?&rsquo; Lord Romfrey said low to Dr. Gannet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unconscious,&rsquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Denham glided about the room and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her business was to remove Dr. Shrapnel, that he might be out of the way
      when Lord Romfrey should pass him again: but Dr. Shrapnel heard one voice
      only, and moaned, &lsquo;My Beauchamp!&rsquo; She could not get him to stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Denham saw him start slightly as the earl stepped forth and, bowing
      to him, said: &lsquo;I thank you, sir, for permitting me to visit my nephew.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Shrapnel made a motion of the hand, to signify freedom of access to
      his house. He would have spoken the effort fetched a burst of terrible
      chuckles. He covered his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey descended. The silly old wretch had disturbed his equanimity
      as a composer of fiction for the comfort and sustainment of his wife: and
      no sooner had he the front door in view than the calculation of the three
      strides requisite to carry him out of the house plucked at his legs, much
      as young people are affected by a dancing measure; for he had, without
      deigning to think of matters disagreeable to him in doing so, performed
      the duty imposed upon him by his wife, and now it behoved him to ward off
      the coming blow from that double life at Romfrey Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was arrested in his hasty passage by Cecilia Halkett.
    </p>
    <p>
      She handed him a telegraphic message: Rosamund requested him to stay two
      days in Bevisham. She said additionally: &lsquo;Perfectly well. Shall fear to
      see you returning yet. Have sent to Tourdestelle. All his friends. Ni
      espoir, ni crainte, mais point de deceptions. Lumiere. Ce sont les
      tenebres qui tuent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her nimble wits had spied him on the road he was choosing, and outrun him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He resigned himself to wait a couple of days at Bevisham. Cecilia begged
      him to accept a bed at Mount Laurels. He declined, and asked her: &lsquo;How is
      it you are here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I called here,&rsquo; said she, compressing her eyelids in anguish at a wilder
      cry of the voice overhead, and forgetting to state why she had called at
      the house and what services she had undertaken. A heap of letters in her
      handwriting explained the nature of her task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey asked her where the colonel was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He drives me down in the morning and back at night, but they will give me
      a bed or a sofa here to-night&mdash;I can&rsquo;t...&rsquo; Cecilia stretched her hand
      out, blinded, to the earl.
    </p>
    <p>
      He squeezed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These letters take away my strength: crying is quite useless, I know
      that,&rsquo; said she, glancing at a pile of letters that she had partly replied
      to. &lsquo;Some are from people who can hardly write. There were people who
      distrusted him! Some are from people who abused him and maltreated him.
      See those poor creatures out in the rain!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey looked through the venetian blinds of the parlour window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s as good as a play to them,&rsquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia lit a candle and applied a stick of black wax to the flame,
      saying: &lsquo;Envelopes have fallen short. These letters will frighten the
      receivers. I cannot help it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will bring letter paper and envelopes in the afternoon,&rsquo; said Lord
      Romfrey. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t use black wax, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can find no other: I do not like to trouble Miss Denham. Letter paper
      has to be sealed. These letters must go by the afternoon post: I do not
      like to rob the poor anxious people of a little hope while he lives. Let
      me have note paper and envelopes quickly: not black-edged.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Plain; that&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; said Lord Romfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black appeared to him like the torch of death flying over the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There may be hope,&rsquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed: &lsquo;Oh! yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gannet will do everything that man can do to save him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He will, I am sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t keep watch in the room, my dear, do you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Denham allows me an hour there in the day: it is the only rest she
      takes. She gives me her bedroom.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha: well: women!&rsquo; ejaculated the earl, and paused. &lsquo;That sounded like
      him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At times,&rsquo; murmured Cecilia. &lsquo;All yesterday! all through the night! and
      to-day!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll be missed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Any sudden light of happier expectation that might have animated him was
      extinguished by the flight of chatter following the cry which had sounded
      like Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out into the rain, thinking that Beauchamp would be missed. The
      fellow had bothered the world, but the world without him would be heavy
      matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour was mid-day, workmen&rsquo;s meal-time. A congregation of shipyard
      workmen and a multitude of children crowded near the door. In passing
      through them, Lord Romfrey was besought for the doctor&rsquo;s report of
      Commander Beauchamp, variously named Beesham, Bosham, Bitcham, Bewsham.
      The earl heard his own name pronounced as he particularly disliked to hear
      it&mdash;Rumfree. Two or three men scowled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had not occurred to him ever before in his meditations to separate his
      blood and race from the common English; and he was not of a character to
      dwell on fantastical and purposeless distinctions, but the
      mispronunciation of his name and his nephew&rsquo;s at an instant when he was
      thinking of Nevil&rsquo;s laying down his life for such men as these gross
      excessive breeders, of ill shape and wooden countenance, pushed him to
      reflections on the madness of Nevil in endeavouring to lift them up and
      brush them up; and a curious tenderness for Nevil&rsquo;s madness worked in his
      breast as he contrasted this much-abused nephew of his with our general
      English&mdash;the so-called nobles, who were sunk in the mud of the
      traders: the traders, who were sinking in the mud of the workmen: the
      workmen, who were like harbour-flats at ebb tide round a stuck-fast fleet
      of vessels big and little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decidedly a fellow like Nevil would be missed by him!
    </p>
    <p>
      These English, huddling more and more in flocks, turning to lumps, getting
      to be cut in a pattern and marked by a label&mdash;how they bark and snap
      to rend an obnoxious original! One may chafe at the botheration
      everlastingly raised by the fellow; but if our England is to keep her
      place she must have him, and many of him. Have him? He&rsquo;s gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey reasoned himself into pathetic sentiment by degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      He purchased the note paper and envelopes in the town for Cecilia. Late in
      the afternoon he deposited them on the parlour table at Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s.
      Miss Denham received him. She was about to lie down for her hour of rest
      on the sofa. Cecilia was upstairs. He inquired if there was any change in
      his nephew&rsquo;s condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not any,&rsquo; said Miss Denham.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice was abroad for proof of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood with a swelling heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny flung out a rug to its length beside the sofa, and; holding it by
      one end, said: &lsquo;I must have my rest, to be of service, my lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed. He was mute and surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady was like no person of her age and sex that he remembered
      ever to have met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will close the door,&rsquo; he said, retiring softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not, my lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The rug was over her, up to her throat, and her eyes were shut. He looked
      back through the doorway in going out. She was asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some delirium. Gannet of good hope. All in the usual course&rsquo;; he
      transmitted intelligence to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strong desire for wine at his dinner-table warned him of something wrong
      with his iron nerves.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LI. IN THE NIGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The delirious voice haunted him. It came no longer accompanied by images
      and likenesses to this and that of animate nature, which were relieving
      and distracting; it came to him in its mortal nakedness&mdash;an
      afflicting incessant ringing peal, bare as death&rsquo;s ribs in telling of
      death. When would it stop? And when it stopped, what would succeed? What
      ghastly silence!
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked to within view of the lights of Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s at night: then
      home to his hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Denham&rsquo;s power of commanding sleep, as he could not, though contrary
      to custom he tried it on the right side and the left, set him thinking of
      her. He owned she was pretty. But that, he contended, was not the word;
      and the word was undiscoverable. Not Cecilia Halkett herself had so
      high-bred an air, for Cecilia had not her fineness of feature and full
      quick eyes, of which the thin eyelids were part of the expression. And
      Cecilia sobbed, snifed, was patched about the face, reddish, bluish. This
      girl was pliable only to service, not to grief: she did her work for
      three-and-twenty hours, and fell to her sleep of one hour like a soldier.
      Lord Romfrey could not recollect anything in a young woman that had taken
      him so much as the girl&rsquo;s tossing out of the rug and covering herself,
      lying down and going to sleep under his nose, absolutely independent of
      his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not betrayed any woman&rsquo;s petulance with him for his conduct to her
      uncle or guardian. Nor had she hypocritically affected the reverse, as
      ductile women do, when they feel wanting in force to do the other. She was
      not unlike Nevil&rsquo;s marquise in face, he thought: less foreign of course;
      looking thrice as firm. Both were delicately featured.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was of an interminable procession of that odd lot called the People.
      All of them were quarrelling under a deluge. One party was for umbrellas,
      one was against them: and sounding the dispute with a question or two,
      Everard held it logical that there should be protection from the wet: just
      as logical on the other hand that so frail a shelter should be discarded,
      considering the tremendous downpour. But as he himself was dry, save for
      two or three drops, he deemed them all lunatics. He requested them to gag
      their empty chatter-boxes, and put the mother upon that child&rsquo;s cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now a simple unit of the procession. Asking naturally whither they
      were going, he saw them point. &lsquo;St. Paul&rsquo;s,&rsquo; he heard. In his own bosom it
      was, and striking like the cathedral big bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several ladies addressed him sorrowfully. He stood alone. It had become
      notorious that he was to do battle, and no one thought well of his
      chances. Devil an enemy to be seen! he muttered. Yet they said the enemy
      was close upon him. His right arm was paralyzed. There was the enemy hard
      in front, mailed, vizored, gauntleted. He tried to lift his right hand,
      and found it grasping an iron ring at the bottom of the deep Steynham
      well, sunk one hundred feet through the chalk. But the unexampled cunning
      of his left arm was his little secret; and, acting upon this knowledge, he
      telegraphed to his first wife at Steynham that Dr. Gannet was of good
      hope, and thereupon he re-entered the ranks of the voluminous procession,
      already winding spirally round the dome of St. Paul&rsquo;s. And there, said he,
      is the tomb of Beauchamp. Everything occurred according to his
      predictions, and he was entirely devoid of astonishment. Yet he would fain
      have known the titles of the slain admiral&rsquo;s naval battles. He protested
      he had a right to know, for he was the hero&rsquo;s uncle, and loved him. He
      assured the stupid scowling people that he loved Nevil Beauchamp, always
      loved the boy, and was the staunchest friend the fellow had. And saying
      that, he certainly felt himself leaning up against the cathedral rails in
      the attitude of Dr. Shrapnel, and crying, &lsquo;Beauchamp! Beauchamp!&rsquo; And then
      he walked firmly out of Romfrey oakwoods, and, at a mile&rsquo;s distance from
      her, related to his countess Rosamund that the burial was over without
      much silly ceremony, and that she needed to know nothing of it whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund&rsquo;s face awoke him. It was the face of a chalk-quarry, featureless,
      hollowed, appalling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour was no later than three in the morning. He quitted the detestable
      bed where a dream&mdash;one of some half-dozen in the course of his
      life-had befallen him. For the maxim of the healthy man is: up, and have
      it out in exercise when sleep is for foisting base coin of dreams upon
      you! And as the healthy only are fit to live, their maxims should be law.
      He dressed and directed his leisurely steps to the common, under a black
      sky, and stars of lively brilliancy. The lights of a carriage gleamed on
      Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s door. A footman informed Lord Romfrey that Colonel Halkett
      was in the house, and soon afterward the colonel appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it over? I don&rsquo;t hear him,&rsquo; said Lord Romfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Halkett grasped his hand. &lsquo;Not yet,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Cissy can&rsquo;t be got
      away. It&rsquo;s killing her. No, he&rsquo;s alive. You may hear him now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey bent his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s weaker,&rsquo; the colonel resumed. &lsquo;By the way, Romfrey, step out with
      me. My dear friend, the circumstances will excuse me: you know I&rsquo;m not a
      man to take liberties. I&rsquo;m bound to tell you what your wife writes to me.
      She says she has it on her conscience, and can&rsquo;t rest for it. You know
      women. She wants you to speak to the man here&mdash;Shrapnel. She wants
      Nevil to hear that you and he were friendly before he dies; thinks it
      would console the poor dear fellow. That&rsquo;s only an idea; but it concerns
      her, you see. I&rsquo;m shocked to have to talk to you about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear colonel, I have no feeling against the man,&rsquo; Lord Romfrey
      replied. &lsquo;I spoke to him when I saw him yesterday. I bear no grudges.
      Where is he? You can send to her to say I have spoken to him twice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; the colonel assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not imagine that Lady Romfrey required more of her husband.
      &lsquo;Well, I must be off. I leave Blackburn Tuckham here, with a friend of
      his; a man who seems to be very sweet with Mrs. Wardour-Devereux.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! Fetch him to me, colonel; I beg you to do that,&rsquo; said Lord Romfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel brought out Lydiard to the earl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been at my nephew&rsquo;s bedside, Mr. Lydiard?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Within ten minutes, my lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is your opinion of the case?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My opinion is, the chances are in his favour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lay me under obligation by communicating that to Romfrey Castle at the
      first opening of the telegraph office to-morrow morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydiard promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The raving has ended?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hardly, sir, but the exhaustion is less than we feared it would be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gannet is there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is in an arm-chair in the room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Dr. Shrapnel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He does not bear speaking to; he is quiet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is attached to my nephew?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As much as to life itself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey thanked Lydiard courteously. &lsquo;Let us hope, sir, that some day
      I shall have the pleasure of entertaining you, as well as another friend
      of yours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are very kind, my lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl stood at the door to see Colonel Halkett drive off: he declined
      to accompany him to Mount Laurels.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the place of the carriage stood a man, who growled &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s your
      horsewhip, butcher?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He dogged the earl some steps across the common. Everard returned to his
      hotel and slept soundly during the remainder of the dark hours.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LII. QUESTION OF A PILGRIMAGE AND AN ACT OF PENANCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Then came a glorious morning for sportsmen. One sniffed the dews, and
      could fancy fresh smells of stubble earth and dank woodland grass in the
      very streets of dirty Bevisham. Sound sleep, like hearty dining, endows
      men with a sense of rectitude, and sunlight following the former, as a
      pleasant spell of conversational ease or sweet music the latter, smiles a
      celestial approval of the performance: Lord Romfrey dismissed his
      anxieties. His lady slightly ruffled him at breakfast in a letter saying
      that she wished to join him. He was annoyed at noon by a message, wherein
      the wish was put as a request. And later arrived another message, bearing
      the character of an urgent petition. True, it might be laid to the account
      of telegraphic brevity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw Dr. Shrapnel, and spoke to him, as before, to thank him for the
      permission to visit his nephew. Nevil he contemplated for the space of
      five minutes. He cordially saluted Miss Denham. He kissed Cecilia&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All here is going on so well that I am with you for a day or two
      to-morrow,&rsquo; he despatched the message to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her case was now the gravest. He could not understand why she desired to
      be in Bevisham. She must have had execrable dreams!&mdash;rank poison to
      mothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, her constitutional strength was great, and his pride in the
      restoration of his House by her agency flourished anew, what with fair
      weather and a favourable report from Dr. Gannet: The weather was most
      propitious to the hopes of any soul bent on dispersing the shadows of
      death, and to sportsmen. From the windows of his railway carriage he
      beheld the happy sportsmen stalking afield. The birds whirred and dropped
      just where he counted on their dropping. The smoke of the guns threaded to
      dazzling silver in the sunshine. Say what poor old Nevil will, or did say,
      previous to the sobering of his blood, where is there a land like England?
      Everard rejoiced in his country temperately. Having Nevil as well,&mdash;of
      which fact the report he was framing in his mind to deliver to his wife
      assured him&mdash;he was rich. And you that put yourselves forward for
      republicans and democrats, do you deny the aristocracy of an oaklike man
      who is young upon the verge of eighty?
    </p>
    <p>
      These were poetic flights, but he knew them not by name, and had not to be
      ashamed of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund met him in the hall of the castle. &lsquo;You have not deceived me, my
      dear lord,&rsquo; she said, embracing him. &lsquo;You have done what you could for me.
      The rest is for me to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He reciprocated her embrace warmly, in commendation of her fresher good
      looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked him, &lsquo;You have spoken to Dr. Shrapnel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered her, &lsquo;Twice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The word seemed quaint. She recollected that he was quaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      He repeated, &lsquo;I spoke to him the first day I saw him, and the second.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are so much indebted to him,&rsquo; said Rosamund. &lsquo;His love of Nevil
      surpasses ours. Poor man! poor man! At least we may now hope the blow will
      be spared him which would have carried off his life with Nevil&rsquo;s. I have
      later news of Nevil than you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good, of course?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah me! the pleasure of the absence of pain. He is not gone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey liked her calm resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a Mr. Lydiard,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;a friend of Nevil&rsquo;s, and a friend of
      Louise Devereux&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; we hear from him every four hours,&rsquo; Rosamund rejoined. &lsquo;Mention him
      to her before me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I was going to tell you to do before me,&rsquo; said her
      husband, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because, Everard, is it not so?&mdash;widows... and she loves this
      gentleman!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, my dear; I think with you about widows. The world asks them to
      practise its own hypocrisy. Louise Devereux was married to a pipe; she&rsquo;s
      the widow of tobacco ash. We&rsquo;ll make daylight round her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How good, how kind you are, my lord! I did not think so shrewd! But
      benevolence is almost all-seeing: You said you spoke to Dr. Shrapnel
      twice. Was he... polite?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thoroughly upset, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did he say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What was it? &ldquo;Beauchamp! Beauchamp!&rdquo; the first time; and the second time
      he said he thought it had left off raining.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; Rosamund drooped her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up. &lsquo;Here is Louise. My lord has had a long conversation with
      Mr. Lydiard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I trust he will come here before you leave us,&rsquo; added the earl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund took her hand. &lsquo;My lord has been more acute than I, or else your
      friend is less guarded than you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you seen?&rsquo; said the blushing lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay. I have an idea you are one of the women I promised to Cecil
      Baskelett,&rsquo; said the earl. &lsquo;Now may I tell him there&rsquo;s no chance?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They spent so very pleasant an evening that the earl settled down into a
      comfortable expectation of the renewal of his old habits in the September
      and October season. Nevil&rsquo;s frightful cry played on his ear-drum at
      whiles, but not too affectingly. He conducted Rosamund to her room, kissed
      her, hoped she would sleep well, and retired to his good hard bachelor&rsquo;s
      bed, where he confidently supposed he would sleep. The sleep of a
      dyspeptic, with a wilder than the monstrous Bevisham dream, befell him,
      causing him to rise at three in the morning and proceed to his lady&rsquo;s
      chamber, to assure himself that at least she slept well. She was awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought you might come,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reproached her gently for indulging foolish nervous fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied, &lsquo;No, I do not; I am easier about Nevil. I begin to think he
      will live. I have something at my heart that prevents me from sleeping. It
      concerns me. Whether he is to live or die, I should like him to know he
      has not striven in vain&mdash;not in everything: not where my conscience
      tells me he was right, and we, I, wrong&mdash;utterly wrong, wickedly
      wrong.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear girl, you are exciting yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; feel my pulse. The dead of night brings out Nevil to me like the
      Writing on the Wall. It shall not be said he failed in everything. Shame
      to us if it could be said! He tried to make me see what my duty was, and
      my honour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was at every man Jack of us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I speak of one thing. I thought I might not have to go. Now I feel I
      must. I remember him at Steynham, when Colonel Halkett and Cecilia were
      there. But for me, Cecilia would now be his wife. Of that there is no
      doubt; that is not the point; regrets are fruitless. I see how the
      struggle it cost him to break with his old love&mdash;that endearing
      Madame de Rouaillout, his Renee&mdash;broke his heart; and then his loss
      of Cecilia Halkett. But I do believe, true as that I am lying here, and
      you hold my hand, my dear husband, those losses were not so fatal to him
      as his sufferings he went through on account of his friend Dr. Shrapnel. I
      will not keep you here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Go and have some rest. What I shall beg of you tomorrow will not injure my
      health in the slightest: the reverse: it will raise me from a bitter
      depression. It shall not be said that those who loved him were unmoved by
      him. Before he comes back to life, or is carried to his grave, he shall
      know that I was not false to my love of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear, your pulse is at ninety,&rsquo; said the earl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look lenient, be kind, be just, my husband. Oh! let us cleanse our
      hearts. This great wrong was my doing. I am not only quite strong enough
      to travel to Bevisham, I shall be happy in going: and when I have done it&mdash;said:
      &ldquo;The wrong was all mine,&rdquo; I shall rejoice like the pure in spirit.
      Forgiveness does not matter, though I now believe that poor loving old man
      who waits outside his door weeping, is wrong-headed only in his political
      views. We women can read men by their power to love. Where love exists
      there is goodness. But it is not for the sake of the poor old man himself
      that I would go: it is for Nevil&rsquo;s; it is for ours, chiefly for me, for my
      child&rsquo;s, if ever...!&rsquo; Rosamund turned her head on her pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl patted her cheek. &lsquo;We &lsquo;ll talk it over in the morning,&rsquo; he said.
      &lsquo;Now go to sleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not say more, for he did not dare to attempt cajolery with her.
      Shading his lamp he stepped softly away to wrestle with a worse nightmare
      than sleep&rsquo;s. Her meaning was clear: and she was a woman to insist on
      doing it. She was nevertheless a woman not impervious to reason, if only
      he could shape her understanding to perceive that the state of her nerves,
      incident to her delicate situation and the shock of that fellow Nevil&rsquo;s
      illness&mdash;poor lad!&mdash;was acting on her mind, rendering her a
      victim of exaggerated ideas of duty, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, apart from allowing her to undertake the journey by rail, he
      could not sanction his lady&rsquo;s humbling of herself so egregiously and
      unnecessarily. Shrapnel had behaved unbecomingly, and had been punished
      for it. He had spoken to Shrapnel, and the affair was virtually at an end.
      With his assistance she would see that, when less excited. Her eternal
      brooding over Nevil was the cause of these mental vagaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey was for postponing the appointed discussion in the morning
      after breakfast. He pleaded business engagements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None so urgent as this of mine,&rsquo; said Rosamund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But we have excellent news of Nevil: you have Gannet&rsquo;s word for it,&rsquo; he
      argued. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s really nothing to distress you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My heart: I must be worthy of good news, to know happiness,&rsquo; she
      answered. &lsquo;I will say, let me go to Bevisham two, three, four days hence,
      if you like, but there is peace for me, and nowhere else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My precious Rosamund! have you set your two eyes on it? What you are
      asking, is for permission to make an apology to Shrapnel!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is the word.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s Nevil&rsquo;s word.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a prescription to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An apology?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl&rsquo;s gorge rose. Why, such an act was comparable to the circular
      mission of the dog!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I do not make the apology, the mother of your child is a coward,&rsquo; said
      Rosamund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I trust not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a reasonable woman, my dear. Now listen the man insulted you.
      It&rsquo;s past: done with. He insulted you...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He did not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was courteous to me, hospitable to me, kind to me. He did not insult
      me. I belied him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear saint, you&rsquo;re dreaming. He spoke insultingly of you to Cecil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is my lord that man&rsquo;s dupe? I would stand against him before the throne
      of God, with what little I know of his interview with Dr. Shrapnel, to
      confront him and expose his lie. Do not speak of him. He stirs my evil
      passions, and makes me feel myself the creature I was when I returned to
      Steynham from my first visit to Bevisham, enraged with jealousy of Dr.
      Shrapnel&rsquo;s influence over Nevil, spiteful, malicious: Oh! such a nest of
      vileness as I pray to heaven I am not now, if it is granted me to give
      life to another. Nevil&rsquo;s misfortunes date from that,&rsquo; she continued, in
      reply to the earl&rsquo;s efforts to soothe her. &lsquo;Not the loss of the Election:
      that was no misfortune, but a lesson. He would not have shone in
      Parliament: he runs too much from first principles to extremes. You see I
      am perfectly reasonable, Everard: &lsquo;I can form an exact estimate of
      character and things.&rsquo; She smiled in his face. &lsquo;And I know my husband too:
      what he will grant; what he would not, and justly would not. I know to a
      certainty that vexatious as I must be to you now, you are conscious of my
      having reason for being so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You carry it so far&mdash;fifty miles beyond the mark,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;The man
      roughed you, and I taught him manners.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; she half screamed her interposition. &lsquo;I repeat, he was in no way
      discourteous or disobliging to me. He offered me a seat at his table, and,
      heaven forgive me! I believe a bed in his house, that I might wait and be
      sure of seeing Nevil, because I was very anxious to see him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All the same, you can&rsquo;t go to the man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should have said so too, before my destiny touched me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A certain dignity of position, my dear, demands a corresponding dignity
      of conduct: you can&rsquo;t go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I am walking in the very eye of heaven, and feeling it shining on me
      where I go, there is no question for me of human dignity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Such flighty talk offended Lord Romfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It comes to this: you&rsquo;re in want of a parson.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund was too careful to hint that she would have expected succour and
      seconding from one or other of the better order of clergymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &lsquo;To this, my dear lord: I have a troubled mind; and it
      is not to listen nor to talk, that I am in need of, but to act.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, my dear girl, but not to act insanely. I do love soundness of head.
      You have it, only just now you&rsquo;re a little astray. We&rsquo;ll leave this matter
      for another time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund held him by the arm. &lsquo;Not too long!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of them applied privately to Mrs. Wardour-Devereux for her opinion
      and counsel on the subject of the proposal to apologize to Dr. Shrapnel.
      She was against it with the earl, and became Rosamund&rsquo;s echo when with
      her. When alone, she was divided into two almost equal halves: deeming
      that the countess should not insist, and the earl should not refuse: him
      she condemned for lack of sufficient spiritual insight to perceive the
      merits of his wife&rsquo;s request: her she accused of some vestige of something
      underbred in her nature, for putting such fervid stress upon the
      supplication: i.e. making too much of it&mdash;a trick of the vulgar: and
      not known to the languid.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrote to Lydiard for advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He condensed a paragraph into a line:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It should be the earl. She is driving him to it, intentionally or not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Devereux doubted that the countess could have so false an idea of her
      husband&rsquo;s character as to think it possible he would ever be bent to
      humble himself to the man he had castigated. She was right. It was by
      honestly presenting to his mind something more loathsome still, the
      humbling of herself, that Rosamund succeeded in awakening some remote
      thoughts of a compromise, in case of necessity. Better I than she!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the necessity was inconceivable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had really done everything required of him, if anything was really
      required, by speaking to Shrapnel civilly. He had spoken to Shrapnel
      twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, the castle was being gladdened by happier tidings of Beauchamp.
      Gannet now pledged his word to the poor fellow&rsquo;s recovery, and the earl&rsquo;s
      particular friends arrived, and the countess entertained them. October
      passed smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said once: &lsquo;Ancestresses of yours, my lord, have undertaken
      pilgrimages as acts of penance for sin, to obtain heaven&rsquo;s intercession in
      their extremity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say they did,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;The monks got round them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not to be laughed at, if it eased their hearts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Timidly she renewed her request for permission to perform the pilgrimage
      to Bevisham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;till Nevil is on his legs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you considered where I may then be, Everard?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My love, you sleep well, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see me every night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see you sound asleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see you watching me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s reason,&rsquo; said the earl; and again they went through the argument
      upon the apology to Dr. Shrapnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was willing to indulge her in any amount of it: and she perceived why.
      Fox! she thought. Grand fox, but fox downright. For her time was
      shortening to days that would leave her no free-will.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, the exercise of her free-will in a fast resolve, was
      growing all the more a privilege that he was bound to respect. As she
      became sacreder and doubly precious to him, the less would he venture to
      thwart her, though he should think her mad. There would be an analogy
      between his manner of regarding her and the way that superstitious
      villagers look on their crazy innocents, she thought sadly. And she bled
      for him too: she grieved to hurt his pride. But she had come to imagine
      that there was no avoidance of this deed of personal humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevil had scrawled a note to her. She had it in her hand one forenoon in
      mid November, when she said to her husband: &lsquo;I have ordered the carriage
      for two o&rsquo;clock to meet the quarter to three train to London, and I have
      sent Stanton on to get the house ready for us tonight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey levelled a marksman&rsquo;s eye at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why London? You know my wish that it should be here at the castle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have decided to go to Bevisham. I have little time left.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None, to my thinking.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh I yes; my heart will be light. I shall gain. You come with me to
      London?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t attempt to reason with me, please, please!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I command, madam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My lord, it is past the hour of commanding.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded his head, with the eyes up amid the puckered brows, and blowing
      one of his long nasal expirations, cried, &lsquo;Here we are, in for another
      bout of argument.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; I can bear the journey, rejoice in confessing my fault, but more
      argument I cannot bear. I will reason with you when I can: submit to me in
      this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Feminine reasoning!&rsquo; he interjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have nothing better to offer. It will be prudent to attend to me. Take
      my conduct for the portion I bring you. Before I put myself in God&rsquo;s care
      I must be clean. I am unclean. Language like that offends you. I have no
      better. My reasoning has not touched you; I am helpless, except in this
      determination that my contrition shall be expressed to Dr. Shrapnel. If I
      am to have life, to be worthy of living and being a mother, it must be
      done. Now, my dear lord, see that, and submit. You&rsquo;re but one voice: I am
      two.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He jumped off his chair, frowning up his forehead, and staring awfully at
      the insulting prospect. &lsquo;An apology to the man? By you? Away with it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Make allowances for me if you can, my dear lord that is what I am going
      to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My wife going there?&rsquo; He strode along furiously. &lsquo;No!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will not stop her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a palsy in my arm if I don&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She plucked at her watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am, I don&rsquo;t know you,&rsquo; he said, coming close to her. &lsquo;Let &lsquo;s
      reason. Perhaps you overshot it; you were disgusted with Shrapnel. Perhaps
      I was hasty; I get fired by an insult to a woman. There was a rascal
      kissed a girl once against her will, and I heard her cry out; I laid him
      on his back for six months; just to tell you; I&rsquo;d do the same to lord or
      beggar. Very well, my dear heart, we&rsquo;ll own I might have looked into the
      case when that dog Cecil... what&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak on, my dear husband,&rsquo; said Rosamund, panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But your making the journey to Bevisham is a foolish notion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes? well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll wait.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! have we to travel over it all again?&rsquo; she exclaimed in despair at the
      dashing out of a light she had fancied. &lsquo;You see the wrong. You know the
      fever it is in my blood, and you bid me wait.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Drop a line to Nevil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To trick my conscience! I might have done that, and done well, once. Do
      you think I dislike the task I propose to myself? It is for your sake that
      I would shun it. As for me, the thought of going there is an ecstasy. I
      shall be with Nevil, and be able to look in his face. And how can I be
      actually abasing you when I am so certain that I am worthier of you in
      what I do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her exaltation swept her on. &lsquo;Hurry there, my lord, if you will. If you
      think it prudent that you should go in my place, go: you deprive me of a
      great joy, but I will not put myself in your way, and I consent. The chief
      sin was mine; remember that. I rank it viler than Cecil Baskelett&rsquo;s. And
      listen: when&mdash;can you reckon?&mdash;when will he confess his
      wickedness? We separate ourselves from a wretch like that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pooh,&rsquo; quoth the earl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you will go?&rsquo; She fastened her arms round the arm nearest: &lsquo;You or I!
      Does it matter which? We are one. You speak for me; I should have been
      forced to speak for you. You spare me the journey. I do not in truth
      suppose it would have injured me; but I would not run one unnecessary
      risk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey sighed profoundly. He could not shake her off. How could he
      refuse her?
    </p>
    <p>
      How on earth had it come about that suddenly he was expected to be the
      person to go?
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not let him elude her; and her stained cheeks and her trembling
      on his arm pleaded most pressingly and masteringly. It might be that she
      spoke with a knowledge of her case. Positive it undoubtedly was that she
      meant to go if he did not. Perhaps the hopes of his House hung on it.
      Having admitted that a wrong had been done, he was not the man to leave it
      unamended; only he would have chosen his time, and the manner. Since
      Nevil&rsquo;s illness, too, he had once or twice been clouded with a little bit
      of regret at the recollection of poor innocent old Shrapnel posted like a
      figure of total inebriation beside the doorway of the dreadful sickroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been women of the earl&rsquo;s illustrious House who would have given
      their hands to the axe rather than conceal a stain and have to dread a
      scandal. His Rosamund, after all, was of their pattern; even though she
      blew that conscience she prattled of into trifles, and swelled them, as
      women of high birth in this country, out of the clutches of the priests,
      do not do.
    </p>
    <p>
      She clung to him for his promise to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: &lsquo;Well, well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That means, you will,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      His not denying it passed for the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then indeed she bloomed with love of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yet do say yes,&rsquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; shouted the earl. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go, my love,&rsquo; he said softly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIII. THE APOLOGY TO DR. SHRAPNEL
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You and Nevil are so alike,&rsquo; Lady Romfrey said to her lord, at some
      secret resemblance she detected and dwelt on fondly, when the earl was on
      the point of starting a second time for Bevisham to perform what she had
      prompted him to conceive his honourable duty, without a single intimation
      that he loathed the task, neither shrug nor grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Two ends of a stick are pretty much alike: they&rsquo;re all that length
      apart,&rsquo; said he, very little in the humour for compliments, however well
      braced for his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife&rsquo;s admiring love was pleasant enough. He preferred to have it
      unspoken. Few of us care to be eulogized in the act of taking a nauseous
      medical mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
      For him the thing was as good as done, on his deciding to think it both
      adviseable and right: so he shouldered his load and marched off with it.
      He could have postponed the right proceeding, even after the partial
      recognition of his error:&mdash;one drops a word or two by hazard, one
      expresses an anxiety to afford reparation, one sends a message, and so
      forth, for the satisfaction of one&rsquo;s conventionally gentlemanly feeling:
      but the adviseable proceeding under stress of peculiar circumstances, his
      clearly-awakened recognition of that, impelled him unhesitatingly. His
      wife had said it was the portion she brought him. Tears would not have
      persuaded him so powerfully, that he might prove to her he was glad of her
      whatever the portion she brought. She was a good wife, a brave woman,
      likely to be an incomparable mother. At present her very virtues excited
      her to fancifulness nevertheless she was in his charge, and he was bound
      to break the neck of his will, to give her perfect peace of wind. The
      child suffers from the mother&rsquo;s mental agitation. It might be a question
      of a nervous or an idiot future Earl of Romfrey. Better death to the House
      than such a mockery of his line! These reflections reminded him of the
      heartiness of his whipping of that poor old tumbled signpost Shrapnel, in
      the name of outraged womankind. If there was no outrage?
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuredly if there was no outrage, consideration for the state of his wife
      would urge him to speak the apology in the most natural manner possible.
      She vowed there was none.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never thought of blaming her for formerly deceiving him, nor of blaming
      her for now expediting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the presence of Colonel Halkett, Mr. Tuckham, and Mr. Lydiard, on a
      fine November afternoon, standing bareheaded in the fir-bordered garden of
      the cottage on the common, Lord Romfrey delivered his apology to Dr.
      Shrapnel, and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I call you to witness, gentlemen, I offer Dr. Shrapnel the fullest
      reparation he may think fit to demand of me for an unprovoked assault on
      him, that I find was quite unjustified, and for which I am here to ask his
      forgiveness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Speech of man could not have been more nobly uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Shrapnel replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To the half of that, sir&mdash;&lsquo;tis over! What remains is done with the
      hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stretched his hand out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey closed his own on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The antagonists, between whom was no pretence of their being other after
      the performance of a creditable ceremony, bowed and exchanged civil
      remarks: and then Lord Romfrey was invited to go into the house and see
      Beauchamp, who happened to be sitting with Cecilia Halkett and Jenny
      Denham. Beauchamp was thin, pale, and quiet; but the sight of him standing
      and conversing after that scene of the skinny creature struggling with
      bareribbed obstruction on the bed, was an example of constitutional vigour
      and a compliment to the family very gratifying to Lord Romfrey. Excepting
      by Cecilia, the earl was coldly received. He had to leave early by special
      express for London to catch the last train to Romfrey. Beauchamp declined
      to fix a day for his visit to the castle with Lydiard, but proposed that
      Lydiard should accompany the earl on his return. Lydiard was called in,
      and at once accepted the earl&rsquo;s invitation, and quitted the room to pack
      his portmanteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint sign of firm-shutting shadowed the corners of Jenny&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have brought my nephew to life,&rsquo; Lord Romfrey said to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My share in it was very small, my lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gannet says that your share in it was very great.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I say so, with the authority of a witness,&rsquo; added Cecilia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I, from my experience,&rsquo; came from Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice had a hollow sound, unlike his natural voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl looked at him remembering the bright laughing lad he had once
      been, and said: &lsquo;Why not try a month of Madeira? You have only to step on
      board the boat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to lose a month of my friend,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take your friend with you. After these fevers our Winters are bad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been idle too long.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Captain Beauchamp,&rsquo; said Jenny, &lsquo;you proposed to do nothing but read
      for a couple of years.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, there&rsquo;s the voyage!&rsquo; sighed he, with a sailor-invalid&rsquo;s vision of
      sunny seas dancing in the far sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must persuade Dr. Shrapnel to come; and he will not come unless you
      come too, and you won&rsquo;t go anywhere but to the Alps!&rsquo; She bent her eyes on
      the floor. Beauchamp remembered what had brought her home from the Alps.
      He cast a cold look on his uncle talking with Cecilia: granite, as he
      thought. And the reflux of that slight feeling of despair seemed to tear
      down with it in wreckage every effort he had made in life, and cry failure
      on him. Yet he was hoping that he had not been created for failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He touched his uncle&rsquo;s hand indifferently: &lsquo;My love to the countess: let
      me hear of her, sir, if you please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall,&rsquo; said the earl. &lsquo;But, off to Madeira, and up Teneriffe: sail
      the Azores. I&rsquo;ll hire you a good-sized schooner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is the Esperanza,&rsquo; said Cecilia. &lsquo;And the vessel is lying idle,
      Nevil! Can you allow it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He consented to laugh at himself, and fell to coughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Denham saw a real human expression of anxiety cross the features of
      the earl at the sound of the cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey said &lsquo;Adieu,&rsquo; to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He offered her his hand, which she contrived to avoid taking by dropping a
      formal half-reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think of the Esperanza; she will be coasting her nominal native land! and
      adieu for to-day,&rsquo; Cecilia said to Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Denham and he stood at the window to watch the leave-taking in the
      garden, for a distraction. They interchanged no remark of surprise at
      seeing the earl and Dr. Shrapnel hand-locked: but Jenny&rsquo;s heart reproached
      her uncle for being actually servile, and Beauchamp accused the earl of
      aristocratic impudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both were overcome with remorse when Colonel Halkett, putting his head
      into the room to say good-bye to Beauchamp and place the Esperanza at his
      disposal for a Winter cruise, chanced to mention in two or three half
      words the purpose of the earl&rsquo;s visit, and what had occurred. He took it
      for known already.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Miss Denham he remarked: &lsquo;Lord Romfrey is very much concerned about
      your health; he fears you have overdone it in nursing Captain Beauchamp!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must be off after him,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, and began trembling so that he
      could not stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel knew the pain and shame of that condition of weakness to a man
      who has been strong and swift, and said: &lsquo;Seven-league boots are not to be
      caught. You&rsquo;ll see him soon. Why, I thought some letter of yours had
      fetched him here! I gave you all the credit of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, he deserves it all himself&mdash;all,&rsquo; said Beauchamp and with a
      dubious eye on Jenny Denham: &lsquo;You see, we were unfair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The &lsquo;we&rsquo; meant &lsquo;you&rsquo; to her sensitiveness; and probably he did mean it for
      &lsquo;you&rsquo;: for as he would have felt, so he supposed that his uncle must have
      felt, Jenny&rsquo;s coldness was much the crueller. Her features, which in
      animation were summer light playing upon smooth water, could be
      exceedingly cold in repose: the icier to those who knew her, because they
      never expressed disdain. No expression of the baser sort belonged to them.
      Beauchamp was intimate with these delicately-cut features; he would have
      shuddered had they chilled on him. He had fallen in love with his uncle;
      he fancied she ought to have done so too; and from his excess of sympathy
      he found her deficient in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat himself down to write a hearty letter to his &lsquo;dear old uncle
      Everard.&rsquo;

      Jenny left him, to go to her chamber and cry.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIV. THE FRUITS OF THE APOLOGY
    </h2>
    <p>
      This clear heart had cause for tears. Her just indignation with Lord
      Romfrey had sustained her artificially hitherto now that it was erased,
      she sank down to weep. Her sentiments toward Lydiard had been very like
      Cecilia Halkett&rsquo;s in favour of Mr. Austin; with something more to warm
      them on the part of the gentleman. He first had led her mind in the
      direction of balanced thought, when, despite her affection for Dr.
      Shrapnel, her timorous maiden wits, unable to contend with the copious
      exclamatory old politician, opposed him silently. Lydiard had helped her
      tongue to speak, as well as her mind to rational views; and there had been
      a bond of union in common for them in his admiration of her father&rsquo;s
      writings. She had known that he was miserably yoked, and had respected him
      when he seemed inclined for compassion without wooing her for tenderness.
      He had not trifled with her, hardly flattered; he had done no more than
      kindle a young girl&rsquo;s imaginative liking. The pale flower of imagination,
      fed by dews, not by sunshine, was born drooping, and hung secret in her
      bosom, shy as a bell of the frail wood-sorrel. Yet there was pain for her
      in the perishing of a thing so poor and lowly. She had not observed the
      change in Lydiard after Beauchamp came on the scene: and that may tell us
      how passionlessly pure the little maidenly sentiment was. For do but look
      on the dewy wood-sorrel flower; it is not violet or rose inviting hands to
      pluck it: still it is there, happy in the woods. And Jenny&rsquo;s feeling was
      that a foot had crushed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wept, thinking confusedly of Lord Romfrey; trying to think he had made
      his amends tardily, and that Beauchamp prized him too highly for the act.
      She had no longer anything to resent: she was obliged to weep. In truth,
      as the earl had noticed, she was physically depressed by the strain of her
      protracted watch over Beauchamp, as well as rather heartsick.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had been of aid and use in saving him! She was not quite a
      valueless person; sweet, too, was the thought that he consulted her,
      listened to her, weighed her ideas. He had evidently taken to study her,
      as if dispersing some wonderment that one of her sex should have ideas. He
      had repeated certain of her own which had been forgotten by her. His eyes
      were often on her with this that she thought humorous intentness. She
      smiled. She had assisted in raising him from his bed of sickness, whereof
      the memory affrighted her and melted her. The difficulty now was to keep
      him indoors, and why he would not go even temporarily to a large house
      like Mount Laurels, whither Colonel Halkett was daily requesting him to
      go, she was unable to comprehend. His love of Dr. Shrapnel might account
      for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Own, Jenny,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, springing up to meet her as she entered the
      room where he and Dr. Shrapnel sat discussing Lord Romfrey&rsquo;s bearing at
      his visit, &lsquo;own that my uncle Everard is a true nobleman. He has to make
      the round to the right mark, but he comes to it. I could not move him&mdash;and
      I like him the better for that. He worked round to it himself. I ought to
      have been sure he would. You&rsquo;re right: I break my head with impatience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; you sowed seed,&rsquo; said Dr. Shrapnel. &lsquo;Heed not that girl, my
      Beauchamp. The old woman&rsquo;s in the Tory, and the Tory leads the young maid.
      Here&rsquo;s a fable I draw from a Naturalist&rsquo;s book, and we&rsquo;ll set it against
      the dicta of Jenny Do-nothing, Jenny Discretion, Jenny Wait-for-the-Gods:
      Once upon a time in a tropical island a man lay sick; so ill that he could
      not rise to trouble his neighbours for help; so weak that it was lifting a
      mountain to get up from his bed; so hopeless of succour that the last
      spark of distraught wisdom perching on his brains advised him to lie where
      he was and trouble not himself, since peace at least he could command,
      before he passed upon the black highroad men call our kingdom of peace:
      ay, he lay there. Now it chanced that this man had a mess to cook for his
      nourishment. And life said, Do it, and death said, To what end? He
      wrestled with the stark limbs of death, and cooked the mess; and that done
      he had no strength remaining to him to consume it, but crept to his bed
      like the toad into winter. Now, meanwhile a steam arose from the mess, and
      he lay stretched. So it befel that the birds of prey of the region scented
      the mess, and they descended and thronged at that man&rsquo;s windows. And the
      man&rsquo;s neighbours looked up at them, for it was the sign of one who is fit
      for the beaks of birds, lying unburied. Fail to spread the pall one hour
      where suns are decisive, and the pall comes down out of heaven! They said,
      The man is dead within. And they went to his room, and saw him and
      succoured him. They lifted him out of death by the last uncut thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, my Jenny Weigh-words, Jenny Halt-there! was it they who saved the
      man, or he that saved himself? The man taxed his expiring breath to sow
      seed of life. Lydiard shall put it into verse for a fable in song for our
      people. I say it is a good fable, and sung spiritedly may serve for
      nourishment, and faith in work, to many of our poor fainting fellows! Now
      you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny said: &lsquo;I think it is a good fable of self-help. Does it quite
      illustrate the case? I mean, the virtue of impatience. But I like the
      fable and the moral; and I think it would do good if it were made popular,
      though it would be hard to condense it to a song.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be hard! ay, then we do it forthwith. And you shall compose the
      music. As for the &ldquo;case of impatience,&rdquo; my dear, you tether the soaring
      universal to your pet-lamb&rsquo;s post, the special. I spoke of seed sown. I
      spoke of the fruits of energy and resolution. Cared I for an apology? I
      took the blows as I take hail from the clouds&mdash;which apologize to you
      the moment you are in shelter, if you laugh at them. So, good night to
      that matter! Are we to have rain this evening? I must away into Bevisham
      to the Workmen&rsquo;s Hall, and pay the men.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There will not be rain; there will be frost, and you must be well wrapped
      if you must go,&rsquo; said Jenny. &lsquo;And tell them not to think of deputations to
      Captain Beauchamp yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no deputations; let them send Killick, if they want to say anything,&rsquo; 
      said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wrong!&rsquo; the doctor cried; &lsquo;wrong! wrong! Six men won&rsquo;t hurt you more than
      one. And why check them when their feelings are up? They burn to be
      speaking some words to you. Trust me, Beauchamp, if we shun to encounter
      the good warm soul of numbers, our hearts are narrowed to them. The
      business of our modern world is to open heart and stretch out arms to
      numbers. In numbers we have our sinews; they are our iron and gold.
      Scatter them not; teach them the secret of cohesion. Practically, since
      they gave you not their entire confidence once, you should not rebuff them
      to suspicions of you as aristocrat, when they rise on the effort to
      believe a man of, as &lsquo;tis called, birth their undivided friend. Meet
      them!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Send them,&rsquo; said Beauchamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Denham fastened a vast cloak and a comforter on the doctor&rsquo;s
      heedless shoulders and throat, enjoining on him to return in good time for
      dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his finger to her cheek in reproof of such supererogatory counsel
      to a man famous for his punctuality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day had darkened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp begged Jenny to play to him on the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you indeed care to have music?&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;I did not wish you to meet
      a deputation, because your strength is not yet equal to it. Dr. Shrapnel
      dwells on principles, forgetful of minor considerations.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish thousands did!&rsquo; cried Beauchamp. &lsquo;When you play I seem to hear
      ideas. Your music makes me think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny lit a pair of candles and set them on the piano. &lsquo;Waltzes?&rsquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Call in a puppet-show at once!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, turned over some leaves, and struck the opening notes of the
      Ninth Symphony of Beethoven, and made her selections.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the finish he said: &lsquo;Now read me your father&rsquo;s poem, &ldquo;The Hunt of the
      Fates.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She read it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now read, &ldquo;The Ascent from the Inferno.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That she read: and also &lsquo;Soul and Brute,&rsquo; another of his favourites.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted more, and told her to read &lsquo;First Love&mdash;Last Love.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear I have not the tone of voice for love-poems,&rsquo; Jenny said,
      returning the book to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll read it,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read with more impressiveness than effect. Lydiard&rsquo;s reading thrilled
      her: Beauchamp&rsquo;s insisted too much on particular lines. But it was worth
      while observing him. She saw him always as in a picture, remote from
      herself. His loftier social station and strange character precluded any of
      those keen suspicions by which women learn that a fire is beginning to
      glow near them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How I should like to have known your father!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at
      Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s love of him. Yes, he was one of the great men of his day!
      and it&rsquo;s a higher honour to be of his blood than any that rank can give.
      You were ten years old when you lost him. Describe him to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He used to play with me like a boy,&rsquo; said Jenny. She described her father
      from a child&rsquo;s recollection of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dr. Shrapnel declares he would have been one of the first surgeons in
      Europe: and he was one of the first of poets,&rsquo; Beauchamp pursued with
      enthusiasm. &lsquo;So he was doubly great. I hold a good surgeon to be in the
      front rank of public benefactors&mdash;where they put rich brewers,
      bankers, and speculative manufacturers now. Well! the world is young. We
      shall alter that in time. Whom did your father marry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny answered, &lsquo;My mother was the daughter of a London lawyer. She
      married without her father&rsquo;s approval of the match, and he left her
      nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp interjected: &lsquo;Lawyer&rsquo;s money!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would have been useful to my mother&rsquo;s household when I was an infant,&rsquo; 
      said Jenny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor soul! I suppose so. Yes; well,&rsquo; Beauchamp sighed. &lsquo;Money! never mind
      how it comes. We&rsquo;re in such a primitive condition that we catch at
      anything to keep us out of the cold; dogs with a bone!&mdash;instead of
      living, as Dr. Shrapnel prophecies, for and, with one another. It&rsquo;s war
      now, and money&rsquo;s the weapon of war. And we&rsquo;re the worst nation in Europe
      for that. But if we fairly recognize it, we shall be the first to alter
      our ways. There&rsquo;s the point. Well, Jenny, I can look you in the face
      to-night. Thanks to my uncle Everard at last!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Captain Beauchamp, you have never been blamed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am Captain Beauchamp by courtesy, in public. My friends call me Nevil.
      I think I have heard the name on your lips?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When you were very ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood closer to her, very close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which was the arm that bled for me? May I look at it? There was a
      bruise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you not forgotten that trifle? There is the faintest possible mark
      of it left.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish to see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She gently defended the arm, but he made it so much a matter of earnest to
      see the bruise of the old Election missile on her fair arm, that, with a
      pardonable soft blush, to avoid making much of it herself, she turned her
      sleeve a little above the wrist. He took her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was for me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was quite an accident: no harm was intended.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it was in my cause&mdash;for me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, Captain Beauchamp...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil, we say indoors.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil&mdash;but is it not wiser to say what comes naturally to us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who told you to-day that you had brought me to life? I am here to prove
      it true. If I had paid attention to your advice, I should not have gone
      into the cottage of those poor creatures and taken away the fever. I did
      no good there. But the man&rsquo;s wife said her husband had been ruined by
      voting for me: and it was a point of honour to go in and sit with him. You
      are not to have your hand back: it is mine. Don&rsquo;t you remember, Jenny, how
      you gave me your arm on the road when I staggered; two days before the
      fever knocked me over? Shall I tell you what I thought then? I thought
      that he who could have you for a mate would have the bravest and
      helpfullest wife in all England. And not a mere beauty, for you have good
      looks: but you have the qualities I have been in search of. Why do your
      eyes look so mournfully at me? I am full of hope. We&rsquo;ll sail the Esperanza
      for the Winter: you and I, and our best friend with us. And you shall have
      a voice in the council, be sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you are two to one?&rsquo; Jenny said quickly, to keep from faltering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp pressed his mouth to the mark of the bruise on her arm. He held
      her fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean it, if you will join me, that you and I should rejoice the heart
      of the dear old man&mdash;will you? He has been brooding over your
      loneliness here if you are unmarried, ever since his recovery. I owe my
      life to you, and every debt of gratitude to him. Now, Jenny!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Captain Beauchamp&mdash;Nevil, if you will... if I may have my hand.
      You exaggerate common kindness. He loves you. We both esteem you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you don&rsquo;t love me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed I have no fear that I shall be unable to support myself, if I am
      left alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I want your help. I wake from illness with my eyes open. I must have
      your arm to lean on now and then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny dropped a shivering sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Uncle is long absent!&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hand was released. Beauchamp inspected his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He may have fallen! He may be lying on the common!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; cried Jenny, &lsquo;why did I let him go out without me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me have his lantern; I&rsquo;ll go and search over the common.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must not go out,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must. The old man may be perishing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will be death to you... Nevil!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That &lsquo;s foolish. I can stand the air for a few minutes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I &lsquo;ll go,&rsquo; said Jenny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unprotected? No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cook shall come with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Two women!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nevil, if you care a little for me, be good, be kind, submit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is half an hour behind dinner-time, and he&rsquo;s never late. Something
      must have happened to him. Way for me, my dear girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood firm between him and the door. It came to pass that she
      stretched her hands to arrest him, and he seized the hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rather than you should go out in this cold weather, anything!&rsquo; she said,
      in the desperation of physical inability to hold him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; Beauchamp crossed his arms round her. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for five minutes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      One went by, with Jenny folded, broken and sobbing, senseless, against his
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not heard Dr. Shrapnel quietly opening the hall door and hanging
      up his hat. He looked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beauchamp!&rsquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, doctor,&rsquo; said Beauchamp, and loosened his clasp of Jenny
      considerately.
    </p>
    <p>
      She disengaged herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beauchamp! now I die a glad man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Witness, doctor, she &lsquo;s mine by her own confession.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Uncle!&rsquo; Jenny gasped. &lsquo;Oh! Captain Beauchamp, what an error! what
      delusion!... Forget it. I will. Here are more misunderstandings! You shall
      be excused. But be...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be you the blessedest woman alive on this earth, my Jenny!&rsquo; shouted Dr.
      Shrapnel. &lsquo;You have the choice man on all the earth for husband,
      sweetheart! Ay, of all the earth! I go with a message for my old friend
      Harry Denham, to quicken him in the grave; for the husband of his girl is
      Nevil Beauchamp! The one thing I dared not dream of thousands is
      established. Sunlight, my Jenny!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp kissed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slipped away to her chamber, grovelling to find her diminished self
      somewhere in the mid-thunder of her amazement, as though it were to
      discover a pin on the floor by the flash of lightning. Where was she!
    </p>
    <p>
      This ensued from the apology of Lord Romfrey to Dr. Shrapnel.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LV. WITHOUT LOVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the end of November, Jenny Denham wrote these lines to Mr. Lydiard, in
      reply to his request that she should furnish the latest particulars of
      Nevil Beauchamp, for the satisfaction of the Countess of Romfrey:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is everything to reassure Lady Romfrey in the state of Captain
      Beauchamp&rsquo;s health, and I have never seen him so placidly happy as he has
      been since the arrival, yesterday morning, of a lady from France, Madame
      la Marquise de Rouaillout, with her brother, M. le Comte de Croisnel. Her
      husband, I hear from M. de Croisnel, dreads our climate and coffee too
      much to attempt the voyage. I understand that she writes to Lady Romfrey
      to-day. Lady Romfrey&rsquo;s letter to her, informing her of Captain Beauchamp&rsquo;s
      alarming illness, went the round from Normandy to Touraine and Dauphiny,
      otherwise she would have come over earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her first inquiry of me was, &ldquo;Il est mort?&rdquo; You would have supposed her
      disappointed by my answer. A light went out in her eyes, like that of a
      veilleuse in the dawn. She looked at me without speaking, while her
      beautiful eyes regained their natural expression. She shut them and
      sighed. &ldquo;Tell him that M. de Croisnel and his sister are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This morning her wish to see Miss Halkett was gratified. You know my
      taste was formed in France; I agree with Captain Beauchamp in his more
      than admiration of Frenchwomen; ours, though more accomplished, are colder
      and less plastic. But Miss Halkett is surpassingly beautiful, very
      amiable, very generous, a perfect friend. She is our country at its best.
      Probably she is shy of speaking French; she frequently puts the Italian
      accent. Madame de Rouaillout begged to speak with her alone: I do not know
      what passed. Miss Halkett did not return to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dr. Shrapnel and Captain Beauchamp have recently been speculating on our
      becoming a nation of artists, and authorities in science and philosophy,
      by the time our coalfields and material wealth are exhausted. That, and
      the cataclysm, are their themes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They say, will things end utterly?&mdash;all our gains be lost? The
      question seems to me to come of that love of earth which is recognition of
      God: for if they cannot reconcile themselves to believe in extinction, to
      what must they be looking? It is a confirmation of your saying, that love
      leads to God, through art or in acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will regret to hear that the project of Captain Beauchamp&rsquo;s voyage is
      in danger of being abandoned. A committee of a vacant Radical borough has
      offered to nominate him. My influence is weak; madame would have him go
      back with her and her brother to Normandy. My influence is weak, I
      suppose, because he finds me constantly leaning to expediency&mdash;I am
      your pupil. It may be quite correct that powder is intended for explosion
      we do not therefore apply a spark to the barrel. I ventured on that. He
      pitied me in the snares of simile and metaphor. He is the same, you
      perceive. How often have we not discussed what would have become of him,
      with that &ldquo;rocket brain&rdquo; of his, in less quiet times! Yet, when he was
      addressing a deputation of workmen the other day, he recommended patience
      to them as one of the virtues that count under wisdom. He is curiously
      impatient for knowledge. One of his reasons for not accepting Colonel
      Halkett&rsquo;s offer of his yacht is, that he will not be able to have books
      enough on board. Definite instead of vast and hazy duties are to be
      desired for him, I think. Most fervently I pray that he will obtain a ship
      and serve some years. At the risk of your accusing me of &ldquo;sententious
      posing,&rdquo; I would say, that men who do not live in the present chiefly, but
      hamper themselves with giant tasks in excess of alarm for the future,
      however devoted and noble they may be&mdash;and he is an example of one
      that is&mdash;reduce themselves to the dimensions of pigmies; they have
      the cry of infants. You reply, Foresight is an element of love of country
      and mankind. But how often is not the foresight guess-work? &lsquo;He has not
      spoken of the DAWN project. To-day he is repeating one of uncle&rsquo;s
      novelties&mdash;&ldquo;Sultry Tories.&rdquo; The sultry Tory sits in the sun and
      prophecies woefully of storm, it appears. Your accusation that I am one at
      heart amuses me; I am not quite able to deny it. &ldquo;Sultriness&rdquo; I am not
      conscious of. But it would appear to be an epithet for the Conservatives
      of wealth. So that England, being very wealthy, we are to call it a sultry
      country? You are much wanted, for where there is no &ldquo;middleman Liberal&rdquo; to
      hold the scales for them, these two have it all their own way, which is
      not good for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Beauchamp quotes you too. It seems that you once talked to him of
      a machine for measuring the force of blows delivered with the fist, and
      compared his efforts to those of one perpetually practising at it: and
      this you are said to have called &ldquo;The case of the Constitutional Realm and
      the extreme Radical.&rdquo; Elsewhere the Radical smites at iron or rotten wood;
      in England it is a cushion on springs. Did you say it? He quotes it as
      yours, half acquiescingly, and ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For visitors, we have had Captain Baskelett for two minutes, and Lord
      Palmet, who stayed longer, and seems to intend to come daily. He attempts
      French with Madame de R., and amuses her a little: a silver foot and a
      ball of worsted. Mr. and Mrs. Grancey Lespel have called, and Lord and
      Lady Croyston. Colonel Halkett, Miss Halkett, and Mr. Tuckham come
      frequently. Captain Beauchamp spoke to her yesterday of her marriage.
      &lsquo;Madame de R. leaves us to-morrow. Her brother is a delightful,
      gay-tempered, very handsome boyish Frenchman&mdash;not her equal, to my
      mind, for I do not think Frenchmen comparable to the women of France; but
      she is exceedingly grave, with hardly a smile, and his high spirits excite
      Nevil&rsquo;s, so it is pleasant to see them together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was handed to Lady Romfrey. She read through it thoughtfully
      till she came to the name of Nevil, when she frowned. On the morrow she
      pronounced it a disingenuous letter. Renee had sent her these lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should come to you if my time were not restricted; my brother&rsquo;s leave
      of absence is short. I have done here what lay in my power, to show you I
      have learnt something in the school of self-immolation. I have seen Mlle.
      Halkett. She is a beautiful young woman, deficient only in words,
      doubtless. My labour, except that it may satisfy you, was the vainest of
      tasks. She marries a ruddy monsieur of a name that I forget, and of the
      bearing of a member of the gardes du corps, without the stature. Enfin,
      madame, I have done my duty, and do not regret it, since I may hope that
      it will win for me some approbation and a portion of the esteem of a lady
      to whom I am indebted for that which is now the best of life to me: and I
      do not undervalue it in saying I would gladly have it stamped on brass and
      deposited beside my father&rsquo;s. I have my faith. I would it were Nevil&rsquo;s too&mdash;and
      yours, should you be in need of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He will marry Mlle. Denham. If I may foretell events, she will steady
      him. She is a young person who will not feel astray in society of his
      rank; she possesses the natural grace we do not expect to see out of our
      country&mdash;from sheer ignorance of what is beyond it. For the moment
      she affects to consider herself unworthy; and it is excuseable that she
      should be slightly alarmed at her prospect. But Nevil must have a wife. I
      presume to think that he could not have chosen better. Above all, make him
      leave England for the Winter. Adieu, dear countess. Nevil promises me a
      visit after his marriage. I shall not set foot on England again: but you,
      should you ever come to our land of France, will find my heart open to you
      at the gates of undying grateful recollection. I am not skilled in
      writing. You have looked into me once; look now; I am the same. Only I
      have succeeded in bringing myself to a greater likeness to the dead, as it
      becomes a creature to be who is coupled with one of their body. Meanwhile
      I shall have news of you. I trust that soon I may be warranted in
      forwarding congratulations to Lord Romfrey.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund handed the letters to her husband. Not only did she think Miss
      Denham disingenuous, she saw that the girl was not in love with Beauchamp:
      and the idea of a loveless marriage for him threw the mournfullest of
      Hecate&rsquo;s beams along the course of a career that the passionate love of a
      bride, though she were not well-born and not wealthy, would have rosily
      coloured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Without love!&rsquo; she exclaimed to herself. She asked the earl&rsquo;s opinion of
      the startling intelligence, and of the character of that Miss Denham, who
      could pen such a letter, after engaging to give her hand to Nevil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey laughed in his dumb way. &lsquo;If Nevil must have a wife&mdash;and
      the marquise tells you so, and she ought to know&mdash;he may as well
      marry a girl who won&rsquo;t go all the way down hill with him at his pace.
      He&rsquo;ll be cogged.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do not object to such an alliance?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I &lsquo;m past objection. There&rsquo;s no law against a man&rsquo;s marrying his nurse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But she is not even in love with him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say not. He wants a wife: she accepts a husband. The two women who
      were in love with him he wouldn&rsquo;t have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Romfrey sighed deeply: &lsquo;He has lost Cecilia! She might still have
      been his: but he has taken to that girl. And Madame de Rouaillout praises
      the girl because&mdash;oh! I see it&mdash;she has less to be jealous of in
      Miss Denham: of whose birth and blood we know nothing. Let that pass! If
      only she loved him! I cannot endure the thought of his marrying a girl who
      is not in love with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just as you like, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I used to suspect Mr. Lydiard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s the man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, what an end of so brilliant a beginning!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It strikes me, my dear,&rsquo; said the earl, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s the proper common sense
      beginning that may have a fairish end.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, but what I feel is that he&mdash;our Nevil!&mdash;has accomplished
      hardly anything, if anything!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He hasn&rsquo;t marched on London with a couple of hundred thousand men: no, he
      hasn&rsquo;t done that,&rsquo; the earl said, glancing back in his mind through
      Beauchamp&rsquo;s career. &lsquo;And he escapes what Stukely calls his nation&rsquo;s
      scourge, in the shape of a statue turned out by an English chisel. No: we
      haven&rsquo;t had much public excitement out of him. But one thing he did do: he
      got me down on my knees!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Romfrey pronounced these words with a sober emphasis that struck the
      humour of it sharply into Rosamund&rsquo;s heart, through some contrast it
      presented between Nevil&rsquo;s aim at the world and hit of a man: the immense
      deal thought of it by the earl, and the very little that Nevil would think
      of it&mdash;the great domestic achievement to be boasted of by an
      enthusiastic devotee of politics!
    </p>
    <p>
      She embraced her husband with peals of loving laughter: the last laughter
      heard in Romfrey Castle for many a day.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVI. THE LAST OF NEVIL BEAUCHAMP
    </h2>
    <p>
      Not before Beauchamp was flying with the Winter gales to warmer climes
      could Rosamund reflect on his career unshadowed by her feminine
      mortification at the thought that he was unloved by the girl he had
      decided to marry. But when he was away and winds blew, the clouds which
      obscured an embracing imagination of him&mdash;such as, to be true and
      full and sufficient, should stretch like the dome of heaven over the
      humblest of lives under contemplation&mdash;broke, and revealed him to her
      as one who had other than failed: rather as one in mid career, in mid
      forest, who, by force of character, advancing in self-conquest, strikes
      his impress right and left around him, because of his aim at stars. He had
      faults, and she gloried to think he had; for the woman&rsquo;s heart rejoiced in
      his portion of our common humanity while she named their prince to men:
      but where was he to be matched in devotedness and in gallantry? and what
      man of blood fiery as Nevil&rsquo;s ever fought so to subject it? Rosamund
      followed him like a migratory bird, hovered over his vessel, perched on
      deck beside the helm, where her sailor was sure to be stationed, entered
      his breast, communed with him, and wound him round and round with her
      love. He has mine! she cried. Her craving that he should be blest in the
      reward, or flower-crown, of his wife&rsquo;s love of him lessened in proportion
      as her brooding spirit vividly realized his deeds. In fact it had been but
      an example of our very general craving for a climax, palpable and scenic.
      She was completely satisfied by her conviction that his wife would respect
      and must be subordinate to him. So it had been with her. As for love, let
      him come to his Rosamund for love, and appreciation, adoration!
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosamund drew nigh to her hour of peril with this torch of her love of
      Beauchamp to illuminate her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been a difficulty in getting him to go. One day Cecilia walked
      down to Dr. Shrapnel&rsquo;s with Mr. Tuckham, to communicate that the Esperanza
      awaited Captain Beauchamp, manned and provisioned, off the pier. Now, he
      would not go without Dr. Shrapnel, nor the doctor without Jenny; and Jenny
      could not hold back, seeing that the wish of her heart was for Nevil to be
      at sea, untroubled by political questions and prowling Radical deputies.
      So her consent was the seal of the voyage. What she would not consent to,
      was the proposal to have her finger ringed previous to the voyage,
      altogether in the manner of a sailor&rsquo;s bride. She seemed to stipulate for
      a term of courtship. Nevil frankly told the doctor that he was not equal
      to it; anything that was kind he was quite ready to say; and anything that
      was pretty: but nothing particularly kind and pretty occurred to him: he
      was exactly like a juvenile correspondent facing a blank sheet of letter
      paper:&mdash;he really did not know what to say, further than the
      uncomplicated exposition of his case, that he wanted a wife and had found
      the very woman. How, then, fathom Jenny&rsquo;s mood for delaying? Dr.
      Shrapnel&rsquo;s exhortations were so worded as to induce her to comport herself
      like a Scriptural woman, humbly wakeful to the surpassing splendour of the
      high fortune which had befallen her in being so selected, and obedient at
      a sign. But she was, it appeared that she was, a maid of scaly vision, not
      perceptive of the blessedness of her lot. She could have been very little
      perceptive, for she did not understand his casual allusion to Beauchamp&rsquo;s
      readiness to overcome &lsquo;a natural repugnance,&rsquo; for the purpose of making
      her his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to the last moment, before Cecilia Halkett left the deck of the
      Esperanza to step on the pier, Jenny remained in vague but excited
      expectation of something intervening to bring Cecilia and Beauchamp
      together. It was not a hope; it was with pure suspense that she awaited
      the issue. Cecilia was pale. Beauchamp shook Mr. Tuckham by the hand, and
      said: &lsquo;I shall not hear the bells, but send me word of it, will you?&rsquo; and
      he wished them both all happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sails of the schooner filled. On a fair frosty day, with a light wind
      ruffling from the North-west, she swept away, out of sight of Bevisham,
      and the island, into the Channel, to within view of the coast of France.
      England once below the water-line, alone with Beauchamp and Dr. Shrapnel,
      Jenny Denham knew her fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as that grew distinctly visible in shape and colour, she ceased to
      be reluctant. All about her, in air and sea and unknown coast, was fresh
      and prompting. And if she looked on Beauchamp, the thought&mdash;my
      husband! palpitated, and destroyed and re-made her. Rapidly she underwent
      her transformation from doubtfully-minded woman to woman awakening
      clear-eyed, and with new sweet shivers in her temperate blood, like the
      tremulous light seen running to the morn upon a quiet sea. She fell under
      the charm of Beauchamp at sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      In view of the island of Madeira, Jenny noticed that some trouble had come
      upon Dr. Shrapnel and Beauchamp, both of whom had been hilarious during
      the gales; but sailing into Summer they began to wear that look which
      indicated one of their serious deliberations. She was not taken into their
      confidence, and after awhile they recovered partially.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was, they had been forced back upon old English ground by a
      recognition of the absolute necessity, for her sake, of handing themselves
      over to a parson. In England, possibly, a civil marriage might have been
      proposed to the poor girl. In a foreign island, they would be driven not
      simply to accept the services of a parson, but to seek him and solicit
      him: otherwise the knot, faster than any sailor&rsquo;s in binding, could not be
      tied. Decidedly it could not; and how submit? Neither Dr. Shrapnel nor
      Beauchamp were of a temper to deceive the clerical gentleman; only they
      had to think of Jenny&rsquo;s feelings. Alas for us!&mdash;this our awful
      baggage in the rear of humanity, these women who have not moved on their
      own feet one step since the primal mother taught them to suckle, are
      perpetually pulling us backward on the march. Slaves of custom, forms,
      shows and superstitions, they are slaves of the priests. &lsquo;They are so in
      gratitude perchance, as the matter works,&rsquo; Dr. Shrapnel admitted. For at
      one period the priests did cherish and protect the weak from animal man.
      But we have entered a broader daylight now, when the sun of high heaven
      has crowned our structure with the flower of brain, like him to scatter
      mists, and penetrate darkness, and shoot from end to end of earth; and
      must we still be grinning subserviently to ancient usages and stale forms,
      because of a baggage that it is, woe to us! too true, we cannot cut
      ourselves loose from? Lydiard might say we are compelling the priests to
      fight, and that they are compact foemen, not always passive. Battle, then!&mdash;The
      cry was valiant. Nevertheless, Jenny would certainly insist upon the
      presence of a parson, in spite of her bridegroom&rsquo;s &lsquo;natural repugnance.&rsquo; 
      Dr. Shrapnel offered to argue it with her, being of opinion that a British
      consul could satisfactorily perform the ceremony. Beauchamp knew her too
      well. Moreover, though tongue-tied as to love-making, he was in a hurry to
      be married. Jenny&rsquo;s eyes were lovely, her smiles were soft; the fair
      promise of her was in bloom on her face and figure. He could not wait; he
      must off to the parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the question as to whether honesty and honour did not impose it
      on them to deal openly with that gentle, and on such occasions unobtrusive
      official, by means of a candid statement to him overnight, to the effect
      that they were the avowed antagonists of his Church, which would put him
      on his defence, and lead to an argument that would accomplish his
      overthrow. You parsons, whose cause is good, marshal out the poor of the
      land, that we may see the sort of army your stewardship has gained for
      you. What! no army? only women and hoary men? And in the rear rank, to
      support you as an institution, none but fanatics, cowards, white-eyeballed
      dogmatists, timeservers, money-changers, mockers in their sleeves? What is
      this?
    </p>
    <p>
      But the prospect of so completely confounding the unfortunate parson
      warned Beauchamp that he might have a shot in his locker: the parson
      heavily trodden on will turn. &lsquo;I suppose we must be hypocrites,&rsquo; he said
      in dejection. Dr. Shrapnel was even more melancholy. He again offered to
      try his persuasiveness upon Jenny. Beauchamp declined to let her be
      disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not yield so very lightly to the invitation to go before a parson.
      She had to be wooed after all; a Harry Hotspur&rsquo;s wooing. Three clergymen
      of the Established Church were on the island: &lsquo;And where won&rsquo;t they be,
      where there&rsquo;s fine scenery and comforts abound?&rsquo; Beauchamp said to the
      doctor ungratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whether a celibate clergy ruins the Faith faster than a non-celibate, I
      won&rsquo;t dispute,&rsquo; replied the doctor; &lsquo;but a non-celibate interwinds with
      us, and is likely to keep up a one-storied edifice longer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny hesitated. She was a faltering unit against an ardent and imperative
      two in the council. And Beauchamp had shown her a letter of Lady Romfrey&rsquo;s
      very clearly signifying that she and her lord anticipated tidings of the
      union. Marrying Beauchamp was no simple adventure. She feared in her
      bosom, and resigned herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a taste of what it was to be, at the conclusion of the service.
      Beauchamp thanked the good-natured clergyman, and spoke approvingly of him
      to his bride, as an agreeable well-bred gentlemanly person. Then, fronting
      her and taking both her hands: &lsquo;Now, my darling,&rsquo; he said: &lsquo;you must
      pledge me your word to this: I have stooped my head to the parson, and I
      am content to have done that to win you, though I don&rsquo;t think much of
      myself for doing it. I can&rsquo;t look so happy as I am. And this idle ceremony&mdash;however,
      I thank God I have you, and I thank you for taking me. But you won&rsquo;t
      expect me to give in to the parson again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Nevil,&rsquo; she said, fearing what was to come: &lsquo;they are gentlemen,
      good men.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are educated men, Nevil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jenny! Jenny Beauchamp, they&rsquo;re not men, they&rsquo;re Churchmen. My experience
      of the priest in our country is, that he has abandoned&mdash;he &lsquo;s dead
      against the only cause that can justify and keep up a Church: the cause of
      the poor&mdash;the people. He is a creature of the moneyed class. I look
      on him as a pretender. I go through his forms, to save my wife from
      annoyance, but there &lsquo;s the end of it: and if ever I&rsquo;m helpless, unable to
      resist him, I rely on your word not to let him intrude; he&rsquo;s to have
      nothing to do with the burial of me. He&rsquo;s against the cause of the people.
      Very well: I make my protest to the death against him. When he&rsquo;s a
      Christian instead of a Churchman, then may my example not be followed. It
      &lsquo;s little use looking for that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny dropped some tears on her bridal day. She sighed her submission. &lsquo;So
      long as you do not change,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Change!&rsquo; cried Nevil. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s for the parson. Now it&rsquo;s over: we start
      fair. My darling! I have you. I don&rsquo;t mean to bother you. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll
      see that the enemies of Reason are the enemies of the human race; you will
      see that. I can wait.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If we can be sure that we ourselves are using reason rightly, Nevil!&mdash;not
      prejudice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course. But don&rsquo;t you see, my Jenny, we have no interest in opposing
      reason?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But have we not all grown up together? And is it just or wise to direct
      our efforts to overthrow a solid structure that is a part...?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his legal right in force to shut her mouth, telling her presently
      she might Lydiardize as much as she liked. While practising this mastery,
      he assured her he would always listen to her: yes, whether she
      Lydiardized, or what Dr. Shrapnel called Jenny-prated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is to say, dear Nevil, that you have quite made up your mind to a
      toddling chattering little nursery wife?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Very much the contrary to anything of the sort, he declared; and he proved
      his honesty by announcing an immediate reflection that had come to him:
      &lsquo;How oddly things are settled! Cecilia Halkett and Tuckham; you and I!
      Now, I know for certain that I have brought Cecilia Halkett out of her
      woman&rsquo;s Toryism, and given her at least liberal views, and she goes and
      marries an arrant Tory; while you, a bit of a Tory at heart, more than
      anything else, have married an ultra.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps we may hope that the conflict will be seasonable on both sides?&mdash;if
      you give me fair play, Nevil!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As fair play as a woman&rsquo;s lord could give her, she was to have; with
      which, adieu to argumentation and controversy, and all the thanks in life
      to the parson! On a lovely island, free from the seductions of care,
      possessing a wife who, instead of starting out of romance and poetry with
      him to the supreme honeymoon, led him back to those forsaken valleys of
      his youth, and taught him the joys of colour and sweet companionship,
      simple delights, a sister mind, with a loveliness of person and nature
      unimagined by him, Beauchamp drank of a happiness that neither Renee nor
      Cecilia had promised. His wooing of Jenny Beauchamp was a flattery richer
      than any the maiden Jenny Denham could have deemed her due; and if his
      wonder in experiencing such strange gladness was quaintly ingenuous, it
      was delicious to her to see and know full surely that he who was at little
      pains to court, or please, independently of the agency of the truth in
      him, had come to be her lover through being her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I would stop. It is Beauchamp&rsquo;s career that carries me on to its
      close, where the lanterns throw their beams off the mudbanks by the black
      riverside; when some few English men and women differed from the world in
      thinking that it had suffered a loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sorrowed for the earl when tidings came to them of the loss of his
      child, alive one hour in his arms. Rosamund caused them to be deceived as
      to her condition. She survived; she wrote to Jenny, bidding her keep her
      husband cruising. Lord Romfrey added a brief word: he told Nevil that he
      would see no one for the present; hoped he would be absent a year, not a
      day less. To render it the more easily practicable, in the next packet of
      letters Colonel Halkett and Cecilia begged them not to bring the Esperanza
      home for the yachting season: the colonel said his daughter was to be
      married in April, and that bridegroom and bride had consented to take an
      old man off with them to Italy; perhaps in the autumn all might meet in
      Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you&rsquo;ve never seen Venice,&rsquo; Beauchamp said to Jenny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everything is new to me,&rsquo; said she, penetrating and gladly joining the
      conspiracy to have him out of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Shrapnel was not so compliant as the young husband. Where he could
      land and botanize, as at Madeira, he let time fly and drum his wings on
      air, but the cities of priests along the coast of Portugal and Spain
      roused him to a burning sense of that flight of time and the vacuity it
      told of in his labours. Greatly to his astonishment, he found that it was
      no longer he and Beauchamp against Jenny, but Jenny and Beauchamp against
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;to draw breath day by day, and not to pay for it by
      striking daily at the rock Iniquity? Are you for that, Beauchamp? And in a
      land where these priests walk with hats curled like the water-lily&rsquo;s leaf
      without the flower? How far will you push indolent unreason to gain the
      delusion of happiness? There is no such thing: but there&rsquo;s trance. That
      talk of happiness is a carrion clamour of the creatures of prey. Take it&mdash;and
      you&rsquo;re helping tear some poor wretch to pieces, whom you might be
      constructing, saving perchance: some one? some thousands! You, Beauchamp,
      when I met you first, you were for England, England! for a breadth of the
      palm of my hand comparatively&mdash;the round of a copper penny, no wider!
      And from that you jumped at a bound to the round of this earth: you were
      for humanity. Ay, we sailed our planet among the icy spheres, and were at
      blood-heat for its destiny, you and I! And now you hover for a wind to
      catch you. So it is for a soul rejecting prayer. This wind and that has
      it: the well-springs within are shut down fast! I pardon my Jenny, my
      Harry Denham&rsquo;s girl. She is a woman, and has a brain like a bell that
      rings all round to the tongue. It is her kingdom, of the interdicted
      untraversed frontiers. But what cares she, or any woman, that this Age of
      ours should lie like a carcase against the Sun? What cares any woman to
      help to hold up Life to him? He breeds divinely upon life, filthy upon
      stagnation. Sail you away, if you will, in your trance. I go. I go home by
      land alone, and I await you. Here in this land of moles upright, I do
      naught but execrate; I am a pulpit of curses. Counter-anathema, you might
      call me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I feel the comparison so, for England shining spiritually bright,&rsquo; 
      said Jenny, and cut her husband adrift with the exclamation, and saw him
      float away to Dr. Shrapnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Spiritually bright!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By comparison, Nevil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s neither spiritual nor political brightness in England, but a
      common resolution to eat of good things and stick to them,&rsquo; said the
      doctor: &lsquo;and we two out of England, there&rsquo;s barely a voice to cry scare to
      the feeders. I&rsquo;m back! I&rsquo;m home!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They lost him once in Cadiz, and discovered him on the quay, looking about
      for a vessel. In getting him to return to the Esperanza, they nearly all
      three fell into the hands of the police. Beauchamp gave him a great deal
      of his time, reading and discussing with him on deck and in the cabin, and
      projecting future enterprises, to pacify his restlessness. A translation
      of Plato had become Beauchamp&rsquo;s intellectual world. This philosopher
      singularly anticipated his ideas. Concerning himself he was beginning to
      think that he had many years ahead of him for work. He was with Dr.
      Shrapnel, as to the battle, and with Jenny as to the delay in recommencing
      it. Both the men laughed at the constant employment she gave them among
      the Greek islands in furnishing her severely accurate accounts of
      sea-fights and land-fights: and the scenes being before them they could
      neither of them protest that their task-work was an idle labour. Dr.
      Shrapnel assisted in fighting Marathon and Salamis over again cordially&mdash;to
      shield Great Britain from the rule of a satrapy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauchamp often tried to conjure words to paint his wife. On grave
      subjects she had the manner of speaking of a shy scholar, and between
      grave and playful, between smiling and serious, her clear head, her nobly
      poised character, seemed to him to have never had a prototype and to elude
      the art of picturing it in expression, until he heard Lydiard call her
      whimsically, &lsquo;Portia disrobing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Portia half in her doctor&rsquo;s gown, half out of it. They met Lydiard and his
      wife Louise, and Mr. and Mrs. Tuckham, in Venice, where, upon the first
      day of October, Jenny Beauchamp gave birth to a son. The thrilling mother
      did not perceive on this occasion the gloom she cast over the father of
      the child and Dr. Shrapnel. The youngster would insist on his right to be
      sprinkled by the parson, to get a legal name and please his mother. At all
      turns in the history of our healthy relations with women we are confronted
      by the parson! &lsquo;And, upon my word, I believe,&rsquo; Beauchamp said to Lydiard,
      &lsquo;those parsons&mdash;not bad creatures in private life: there was one in
      Madeira I took a personal liking to&mdash;but they&rsquo;re utterly ignorant of
      what men feel to them&mdash;more ignorant than women!&rsquo; Mr. Tuckham and
      Mrs. Lydiard would not listen to his foolish objections; nor were they
      ever mentioned to Jenny. Apparently the commission of the act of marriage
      was to force Beauchamp from all his positions one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The education of that child?&rsquo; Mrs. Lydiard said to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      He considered that the mother would prevail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cecilia feared she would not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Depend upon it, he&rsquo;ll make himself miserable if he can,&rsquo; said Tuckham.
    </p>
    <p>
      That gentleman, however, was perpetually coming fuming from arguments with
      Beauchamp, and his opinion was a controversialist&rsquo;s. His common sense was
      much afflicted. &lsquo;I thought marriage would have stopped all those
      absurdities,&rsquo; he said, glaring angrily, laughing, and then frowning. &lsquo;I
      &lsquo;ve warned him I&rsquo;ll go out of my way to come across him if he carries on
      his headlong folly. A man should accept his country for what it is when
      he&rsquo;s born into it. Don&rsquo;t tell me he&rsquo;s a good fellow. I know he is, but
      there &lsquo;s an ass mounted on the good fellow. Talks of the parsons! Why,
      they&rsquo;re men of education.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They couldn&rsquo;t steer a ship in a gale, though.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! he&rsquo;s a good sailor. And let him go to sea,&rsquo; said Tuckham. &lsquo;His wife&rsquo;s
      a prize. He&rsquo;s hardly worthy of her. If she manages him she&rsquo;ll deserve a
      monument for doing a public service.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      How fortunate it is for us that here and there we do not succeed in
      wresting our temporary treasure from the grasp of the Fates!
    </p>
    <p>
      This good old commonplace reflection came to Beauchamp while clasping his
      wife&rsquo;s hand on the deck of the Esperanza, and looking up at the mountains
      over the Gulf of Venice. The impression of that marvellous dawn when he
      and Renee looked up hand-in-hand was ineffaceable, and pity for the tender
      hand lost to him wrought in his blood, but Jenny was a peerless wife; and
      though not in the music of her tongue, or in subtlety of delicate meaning
      did she excel Renee, as a sober adviser she did, and as a firm speaker;
      and she had homelier deep eyes, thoughtfuller brows. The father could
      speculate with good hope of Jenny&rsquo;s child. Cecilia&rsquo;s wealth, too, had gone
      over to the Tory party, with her incomprehensible espousal of Tuckham. Let
      it go; let all go for dowerless Jenny!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was (she dared to recollect it in her anguish) Jenny&rsquo;s choice to go
      home in the yacht that decided her husband not to make the journey by land
      in company with the Lydiards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voyage was favourable. Beauchamp had a passing wish to land on the
      Norman coast, and take Jenny for a day to Tourdestelle. He deferred to her
      desire to land baby speedily, now they were so near home. They ran past
      Otley river, having sight of Mount Laurels, and on to Bevisham, with
      swelling sails. There they parted. Beauchamp made it one of his &lsquo;points of
      honour&rsquo; to deliver the vessel where he had taken her, at her moorings in
      the Otley. One of the piermen stood before Beauchamp, and saluting him,
      said he had been directed to inform him that the Earl of Romfrey was with
      Colonel Halkett, expecting him at Mount Laurels. Beauchamp wanted his wife
      to return in the yacht. She turned her eyes to Dr. Shrapnel. It was out of
      the question that the doctor should think of going. Husband and wife
      parted. She saw him no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is no time to tell of weeping. The dry chronicle is fittest. Hard on
      nine o&rsquo;clock in the December darkness, the night being still and clear,
      Jenny&rsquo;s babe was at her breast, and her ears were awake for the return of
      her husband. A man rang at the door of the house, and asked to see Dr.
      Shrapnel. This man was Killick, the Radical Sam of politics. He said to
      the doctor: &lsquo;I &lsquo;m going to hit you sharp, sir; I&rsquo;ve had it myself: please
      put on your hat and come out with me; and close the door. They mustn&rsquo;t
      hear inside. And here&rsquo;s a fly. I knew you&rsquo;d be off for the finding of the
      body. Commander Beauchamp&rsquo;s drowned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Shrapnel drove round by the shore of the broad water past a great
      hospital and ruined abbey to Otley village. Killick had lifted him into
      the conveyance, and he lifted him out. Dr. Shrapnel had not spoken a word.
      Lights were flaring on the river, illuminating the small craft sombrely.
      Men, women, and children crowded the hard and landing-places, the marshy
      banks and the decks of colliers and trawlers. Neither Killick nor Dr.
      Shrapnel questioned them. The lights were torches and lanterns; the
      occupation of the boats moving in couples was the dragging for the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O God, let&rsquo;s find his body,&rsquo; a woman called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just a word; is it Commander Beauchamp?&rsquo; Killick said to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was scarcely aware of a question. &lsquo;Here, this one,&rsquo; she said, and
      plucked a little boy of eight by the hand close against her side, and
      shook him roughly and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old man volunteered information. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the boy. That boy was in his
      father&rsquo;s boat out there, with two of his brothers, larking; and he and
      another older than him fell overboard; and just then Commander Beauchamp
      was rowing by, and I saw him from off here, where I stood, jump up and
      dive, and he swam to his boat with one of them, and got him in safe: that
      boy: and he dived again after the other, and was down a long time. Either
      he burst a vessel or he got cramp, for he&rsquo;d been rowing himself from the
      schooner grounded down at the river-mouth, and must have been hot when he
      jumped in: either way, he fetched the second up, and sank with him. Down
      he went.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A fisherman said to Killick: &lsquo;Do you hear that voice thundering? That&rsquo;s
      the great Lord Romfrey. He&rsquo;s been directing the dragging since five o&rsquo; the
      evening, and will till he drops or drowns, or up comes the body.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O God, let&rsquo;s find the body!&rsquo; the woman with the little boy called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      A torch lit up Lord Romfrey&rsquo;s face as he stepped ashore. &lsquo;The flood has
      played us a trick,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;We want more drags, or with the next ebb the
      body may be lost for days in this infernal water.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother of the rescued boy sobbed, &lsquo;Oh, my lord, my lord!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl caught sight of Dr. Shrapnel, and went to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My wife has gone down to Mrs. Beauchamp,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;She will bring her
      and the baby to Mount Laurels. The child will have to be hand-fed. I take
      you with me. You must not be alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his arm within the arm of the heavily-breathing man whom he had
      once flung to the ground, to support him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My lord! my lord!&rsquo; sobbed the woman, and dropped on her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What &lsquo;s this?&rsquo; the earl said, drawing his hand away from the woman&rsquo;s
      clutch at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s the mother, my lord,&rsquo; several explained to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother of what?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My boy,&rsquo; the woman cried, and dragged the urchin to Lord Romfrey&rsquo;s feet,
      cleaning her boy&rsquo;s face with her apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the boy Commander Beauchamp drowned to save,&rsquo; said a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the lights of the ring were turned on the head of the boy. Dr.
      Shrapnel&rsquo;s eyes and Lord Romfrey&rsquo;s fell on the abashed little creature.
      The boy struck out both arms to get his fists against his eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is what we have in exchange for Beauchamp!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not uttered, but it was visible in the blank stare at one another
      of the two men who loved Beauchamp, after they had examined the
      insignificant bit of mudbank life remaining in this world in the place of
      him.

     Energy to something, that was not to be had in a market
     Feigned utter condemnation to make partial comfort acceptable
     Feminine pity, which is nearer to contempt than to tenderness
     Fine eye for celestially directed consequences is ever haunted
     Fit of Republicanism in the nursery
     Forewarn readers of this history that there is no plot in it
     Fretted by his relatives he cannot be much of a giant
     Frozen vanity called pride, which does not seek to be revenged
     Give our courage as hostage for the fulfilment of what we hope
     Give our consciences to the keeping of the parsons
     Given up his brains for a lodging to a single idea
     Good maxim for the wrathful&mdash;speak not at all
     Grief of an ill-fortuned passion of his youth
     Had come to be her lover through being her husband
     Half-truth that we may put on the mask of the whole
     Hates a compromise
     Haunted many pillows
     He was too much on fire to know the taste of absurdity
     He condensed a paragraph into a line
     He runs too much from first principles to extremes
     He bowed to facts
     He lost the art of observing himself
     He had expected romance, and had met merchandize
     He smoked, Lord Avonley said of the second departure
     He never calculated on the happening of mortal accidents
     Heights of humour beyond laughter
     Holding to his work after the strain&rsquo;s over&mdash;That tells the man
     Hopes of a coming disillusion that would restore him
     How angry I should be with you if you were not so beautiful!
     Humour preserved her from excesses of sentiment
     I can confess my sight to be imperfect: but will you ever do so?
     I do not think Frenchmen comparable to the women of France
     I cannot say less, and will say no more
     If there&rsquo;s no doubt about it, how is it I have a doubt about it?
     Immense wealth and native obtuseness combine to disfigure us
     Impossible for him to think that women thought
     Impudent boy&rsquo;s fling at superiority over the superior
     In India they sacrifice the widows, in France the virgins
     Incessantly speaking of the necessity we granted it unknowingly
     Infallibility of our august mother
     Inflicted no foretaste of her coming subjection to him
     Irony provoked his laughter more than fun
     Irritability at the intrusion of past disputes
     It would be hard! ay, then we do it forthwith
     It is not high flying, which usually ends in heavy falling
     Leader accustomed to count ahead upon vapourish abstractions
     Led him to impress his unchangeableness upon her
     Let none of us be so exalted above the wit of daily life
     Levelling a finger at the taxpayer
     Love, that has risen above emotion, quite independent of craving
     Love&rsquo;s a selfish business one has work in hand
     Made of his creed a strait-jacket for humanity
     Making too much of it&mdash;a trick of the vulgar
     Man owes a duty to his class
     Mankind is offended by heterodoxy in mean attire
     Mark of a fool to take everybody for a bigger fool than himself
     Martyrs of love or religion are madmen
     May not one love, not craving to be beloved?
     Men had not pleased him of late
     Mental and moral neuters
     Money&rsquo;s a chain-cable for holding men to their senses
     More argument I cannot bear
     Never was a word fitter for a quack&rsquo;s mouth than &ldquo;humanity&rdquo;
      Never pretend to know a girl by her face
     No heart to dare is no heart to love!
     No case is hopeless till a man consents to think it is
     No stopping the Press while the people have an appetite for it
     No man has a firm foothold who pretends to it
     None but fanatics, cowards, white-eyeballed dogmatists
     Oggler&rsquo;s genial piety made him shrink with nausea
     On which does the eye linger longest&mdash;which draws the heart?
     Once called her beautiful; his praise had given her beauty
     Oratory will not work against the stream, or on languid tides
     Parliament, is the best of occupations for idle men
     Passion is not invariably love
     Past fairness, vaguely like a snow landscape in the thaw
     Peace-party which opposed was the actual cause of the war
     Peculiar subdued form of laughter through the nose
     People with whom a mute conformity is as good as worship
     People is one of your Radical big words that burst at a query
     Planting the past in the present like a perceptible ghost
     Play the great game of blunders
     Please to be pathetic on that subject after I am wrinkled
     Pleasure-giving laws that make the curves we recognize as beauty
     Politics as well as the other diseases
     Practical or not, the good people affectingly wish to be
     Prayer for an object is the cajolery of an idol
     Press, which had kindled, proceeded to extinguished
     Presumptuous belief
     Protestant clergy the social police of the English middle-class
     Push indolent unreason to gain the delusion of happiness
     Ready is the ardent mind to take footing on the last thing done
     Rebellion against society and advocacy of humanity run counter
     Reproof of such supererogatory counsel
     Scotchman&rsquo;s metaphysics; you know nothing clear
     She was not, happily, one of the women who betray strong feeling
     She had no longer anything to resent: she was obliged to weep
     Shun comparisons
     Shuns the statuesque pathetic, or any kind of posturing
     Silence and such signs are like revelations in black night
     Slaves of the priests
     Small things producing great consequences
     So the frog telleth tadpoles
     Socially and politically mean one thing in the end
     Story that she believed indeed, but had not quite sensibly felt
     Straining for common talk, and showing the strain
     Style resembling either early architecture or utter dilapidation
     That a mask is a concealment
     The girl could not know her own mind, for she suited him exactly
     The critic that sneers
     The religion of this vast English middle-class&mdash;Comfort
     The slavery of the love of a woman chained
     The turn will come to us as to others&mdash;and go
     The language of party is eloquent
     The defensive is perilous policy in war
     The healthy only are fit to live
     The system is cursed by nature, and that means by heaven
     The world without him would be heavy matter
     The weighty and the trivial contended
     The rider&rsquo;s too heavy for the horse in England
     The greater wounds do not immediately convince us of our fate
     The people always wait for the winner
     The defensive is perilous policy in war
     The family view is everlastingly the shopkeeper&rsquo;s
     The infant candidate delights in his honesty
     The tragedy of the mirror is one for a woman to write
     Their hearts are eaten up by property
     Their not caring to think at all
     There is no step backward in life
     There may be women who think as well as feel; I don&rsquo;t know them
     There is no first claim
     There&rsquo;s nothing like a metaphor for an evasion
     They may know how to make themselves happy in their climate
     They have their thinking done for them
     They&rsquo;re always having to retire and always hissing
     Thirst for the haranguing of crowds
     This girl was pliable only to service, not to grief
     Those whose humour consists of a readiness to laugh
     Those happy men who enjoy perceptions without opinions
     Threatened powerful drugs for weak stomachs
     Times when an example is needed by brave men
     To beg the vote and wink the bribe
     Tongue flew, thought followed
     Too many time-servers rot the State
     Trust no man Still, this man may be better than that man
     Unanimous verdicts from a jury of temporary impressions
     Use your religion like a drug
     Virtue of impatience
     We do not see clearly when we are trying to deceive
     We women can read men by their power to love
     We could row and ride and fish and shoot, and breed largely
     We dare not be weak if we would
     We were unarmed, and the spectacle was distressing
     We can&rsquo;t hope to have what should be
     We have a system, not planned but grown
     We are chiefly led by hope
     We&rsquo;re treated like old-fashioned ornaments!
     Welcomed and lured on an adversary to wild outhitting
     Well, sir, we must sell our opium
     What ninnies call Nature in books
     When he&rsquo;s a Christian instead of a Churchman
     Where love exists there is goodness
     Who cannot talk!&mdash;but who can?
     Without a single intimation that he loathed the task
     Wives are only an item in the list, and not the most important
     Women don&rsquo;t care uncommonly for the men who love them
     Women must not be judging things out of their sphere
     Won&rsquo;t do to be taking in reefs on a lee-shore
     Wonderment that one of her sex should have ideas
     Wooing a good man for his friendship
     World cannot pardon a breach of continuity
     You are not married, you are simply chained

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
